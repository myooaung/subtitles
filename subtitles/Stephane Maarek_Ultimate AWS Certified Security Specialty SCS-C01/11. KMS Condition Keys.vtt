00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:01.770
<v Instructor>So while using KMS,</v>
2

2

00:00:01.770  -->  00:00:04.560
we get access to a few condition keys
3

3

00:00:04.560  -->  00:00:07.590
and the first one is kms:ViaService.
4

4

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:09.960
So kms:ViaService ensures
5

5

00:00:09.960  -->  00:00:13.110
that your KMS key is going to be only used
6

6

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:15.930
by the specified AWS service.
7

7

00:00:15.930  -->  00:00:18.330
So here if I create a key,
8

8

00:00:18.330  -->  00:00:22.170
and I said the action is for the user to create a grant,
9

9

00:00:22.170  -->  00:00:25.650
and KMS is via service EC2 or RDS, that means
10

10

00:00:25.650  -->  00:00:30.000
that this user can only use this key through Amazon EC2,
11

11

00:00:30.000  -->  00:00:34.740
so EBS volumes or RDS to encrypt RDS databases.
12

12

00:00:34.740  -->  00:00:37.920
So it's very helpful to limit scope
13

13

00:00:37.920  -->  00:00:39.930
and to make sure a key cannot be used outside
14

14

00:00:39.930  -->  00:00:41.700
of certain services.
15

15

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:45.090
So the IAM user, of course, then must be authorized
16

16

00:00:45.090  -->  00:00:48.540
to use the key to grant it to the AWS service.
17

17

00:00:48.540  -->  00:00:50.400
And this is something you'll see
18

18

00:00:50.400  -->  00:00:52.650
when you have AWS-managed key.
19

19

00:00:52.650  -->  00:00:55.680
You will find this via service condition in them.
20

20

00:00:55.680  -->  00:00:58.470
So have a look at, for example, the KMS key policy
21

21

00:00:58.470  -->  00:01:02.250
of AWS/EBS and you will find something similar.
22

22

00:01:02.250  -->  00:01:04.920
The second thing is kms:CallerAccount.
23

23

00:01:04.920  -->  00:01:08.250
So you can allow or deny access to all identities,
24

24

00:01:08.250  -->  00:01:11.520
IAM users, and roles in specific accounts.
25

25

00:01:11.520  -->  00:01:14.640
So this is an example for the KMS key policy.
26

26

00:01:14.640  -->  00:01:18.270
Here we have principal star for AWS,
27

27

00:01:18.270  -->  00:01:20.580
which means everything within AWS as long
28

28

00:01:20.580  -->  00:01:23.730
as the condition came as CallerAccount corresponds
29

29

00:01:23.730  -->  00:01:26.040
to your account ID of your key meaning
30

30

00:01:26.040  -->  00:01:28.620
that anything within this account can use this key.
31

31

00:01:28.620  -->  00:01:31.320
So these two condition keys can come up at the exam.
32

32

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:33.120
So it's good for you to have seen them once.
33

33

00:01:33.120  -->  00:01:34.470
I hope you like this lecture
34

34

00:01:34.470  -->  00:01:36.420
and I will see you in the next lecture.
