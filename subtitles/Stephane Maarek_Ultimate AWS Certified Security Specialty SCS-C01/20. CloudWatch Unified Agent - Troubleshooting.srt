1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:03,030
<v Instructor>So you need to be able to troubleshoot issues</v>
2

2

00:00:03,030  -->  00:00:04,620
with the Unified CloudWatch Agent.
3

3

00:00:04,620  -->  00:00:08,010
So, in case the agents fails to start, it may be an issue
4

4

00:00:08,010  -->  00:00:10,080
with the configuration file, in which case,
5

5

00:00:10,080  -->  00:00:12,930
you should go into this file logs
6

6

00:00:12,930  -->  00:00:15,900
at this place on your EC2 instance,
7

7

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:18,120
which is going to give you some configuration validation,
8

8

00:00:18,120  -->  00:00:19,560
and information.
9

9

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:21,300
If you cannot find the metrics collected
10

10

00:00:21,300  -->  00:00:23,190
by the CloudWatch Agent, of course,
11

11

00:00:23,190  -->  00:00:25,530
check whether or not you are in the correct namespace.
12

12

00:00:25,530  -->  00:00:28,650
The default for the CloudWatch Agent is CWAgent.
13

13

00:00:28,650  -->  00:00:31,260
And then you check the configuration of the Agent itself,
14

14

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:32,760
it's a JSON document,
15

15

00:00:32,760  -->  00:00:35,250
and this is the kind of configuration it has.
16

16

00:00:35,250  -->  00:00:38,730
So you can check the region, you can check the debug mode,
17

17

00:00:38,730  -->  00:00:41,730
and you can check as well the run as user,
18

18

00:00:41,730  -->  00:00:43,020
because if these things go wrong,
19

19

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:45,363
then the CloudWatch Agent may not work.
20

20

00:00:46,290  -->  00:00:47,970
On top of it, if the CloudWatch Agent
21

21

00:00:47,970  -->  00:00:50,400
is not publishing log events,
22

22

00:00:50,400  -->  00:00:53,130
then look at the CloudWatch Agent version,
23

23

00:00:53,130  -->  00:00:56,070
test connectivity from the Agent into
24

24

00:00:56,070  -->  00:00:57,930
the Logs endpoint of AWS.
25

25

00:00:57,930  -->  00:01:00,630
So that includes checking your Security Group rules,
26

26

00:01:00,630  -->  00:01:02,640
and your network ACLs.
27

27

00:01:02,640  -->  00:01:03,960
Please review your account, region,
28

28

00:01:03,960  -->  00:01:06,090
and log group configuration.
29

29

00:01:06,090  -->  00:01:07,860
Check your IAM permissions, of course,
30

30

00:01:07,860  -->  00:01:10,530
because you may need to have a Custom Policy
31

31

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:11,640
if you're missing it,
32

32

00:01:11,640  -->  00:01:13,920
or you can just use Managed Policies as well
33

33

00:01:13,920  -->  00:01:16,200
if you want to use a shortcut.
34

34

00:01:16,200  -->  00:01:18,570
And verify that the system time on the instance
35

35

00:01:18,570  -->  00:01:21,480
is correctly configured, and in sync.
36

36

00:01:21,480  -->  00:01:26,040
Again, there's a debug file for the CloudWatch Agent Logs
37

37

00:01:26,040  -->  00:01:27,900
that you can find on your EC2 instance
38

38

00:01:27,900  -->  00:01:29,910
to give you more information.
39

39

00:01:29,910  -->  00:01:31,380
Alright, that's it for this lecture.
40

40

00:01:31,380  -->  00:01:32,550
I hope you liked it,
41

41

00:01:32,550  -->  00:01:34,500
and I will see you in the next lecture.
