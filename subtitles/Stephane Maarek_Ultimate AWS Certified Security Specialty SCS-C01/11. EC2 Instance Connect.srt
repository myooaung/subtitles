00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:02,970
<v Instructor>So we've been using EC2 instance connect</v>
2

2

00:00:02,970  -->  00:00:04,740
a lot in the courses,
3

3

00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:06,480
but now it's time to really understand
4

4

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:08,700
what is happening when you use that service.
5

5

00:00:08,700  -->  00:00:11,550
So we have an EC2 instance and we have a web browser
6

6

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:13,440
that's running on the public IP.
7

7

00:00:13,440  -->  00:00:15,780
On the EC2 instance is going to be running
8

8

00:00:15,780  -->  00:00:18,240
the EC2 instance connect agent,
9

9

00:00:18,240  -->  00:00:19,980
and that agent is going to be responsible
10

10

00:00:19,980  -->  00:00:22,200
for part of the magic.
11

11

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:26,010
Now when we use the EC2 instance connect, we use its API,
12

12

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:29,670
so either using the EC2 console or the CLI.
13

13

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:30,503
And what's going to happen
14

14

00:00:30,503  -->  00:00:33,120
is that the EC2 instance connect API
15

15

00:00:33,120  -->  00:00:36,300
is going to generate a private key, okay?
16

16

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:39,930
And this private key will have its corresponding
17

17

00:00:39,930  -->  00:00:44,460
public key pushed into the EC2 instance metadata,
18

18

00:00:44,460  -->  00:00:46,650
and this is a key that is going to be valid
19

19

00:00:46,650  -->  00:00:48,960
only for 60 seconds.
20

20

00:00:48,960  -->  00:00:50,400
So why is it important?
21

21

00:00:50,400  -->  00:00:53,310
Because then the EC2 instance connect API
22

22

00:00:53,310  -->  00:00:56,730
is going to SSH directly into the EC2 instance,
23

23

00:00:56,730  -->  00:01:01,500
and the EC2 instance SSH process is set up in such a way,
24

24

00:01:01,500  -->  00:01:05,280
that it is also going to look up the instance metadata
25

25

00:01:05,280  -->  00:01:08,040
to see if there are any authorized keys in there as well.
26

26

00:01:08,040  -->  00:01:12,030
So not only the authorized keys file on the EC2 instance,
27

27

00:01:12,030  -->  00:01:15,000
but also going to check the instance metadata.
28

28

00:01:15,000  -->  00:01:16,770
And because well, we have just,
29

29

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:19,350
I mean the EC2 instance connect service,
30

30

00:01:19,350  -->  00:01:23,220
has just pushed a public key onto the instance metadata,
31

31

00:01:23,220  -->  00:01:25,650
is going to say, yeah, it matches the private key,
32

32

00:01:25,650  -->  00:01:27,270
and we are SSHed.
33

33

00:01:27,270  -->  00:01:30,600
So the idea around this is that it's very secure,
34

34

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:33,450
because the public key is only there for 60 seconds,
35

35

00:01:33,450  -->  00:01:35,820
and no one else can reproduce this but AWS,
36

36

00:01:35,820  -->  00:01:37,890
because no one else but AWS
37

37

00:01:37,890  -->  00:01:40,530
has access to the instance metadata.
38

38

00:01:40,530  -->  00:01:42,420
Now all connections that we do
39

39

00:01:42,420  -->  00:01:44,280
through the EC2 instance connect,
40

40

00:01:44,280  -->  00:01:45,660
are going to be logged in CloudTrail,
41

41

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:49,713
because we actually go and do SSH through an AWS API.
42

42

00:01:51,210  -->  00:01:53,370
Now what goes for the security groups?
43

43

00:01:53,370  -->  00:01:55,230
Well, there's a security group, of course,
44

44

00:01:55,230  -->  00:01:59,550
around the EC2 instance, and it needs a few rules to work.
45

45

00:01:59,550  -->  00:02:02,550
So when, if you look at this diagram,
46

46

00:02:02,550  -->  00:02:05,460
the actual thing that does the SSH connection
47

47

00:02:05,460  -->  00:02:09,510
is the EC2 instance connect API, not your browser itself.
48

48

00:02:09,510  -->  00:02:11,880
Your browser just accesses that API.
49

49

00:02:11,880  -->  00:02:14,700
So therefore, from a security group perspective,
50

50

00:02:14,700  -->  00:02:17,790
you need to have port 22 open on your EC2 instance
51

51

00:02:17,790  -->  00:02:21,570
as inbound, and the source of it should correspond
52

52

00:02:21,570  -->  00:02:26,310
to the AWS IP range for the EC2 instance connect service.
53

53

00:02:26,310  -->  00:02:27,840
Now, how do you know this?
54

54

00:02:27,840  -->  00:02:30,900
Well, there is this URL in which you can find the IP ranges
55

55

00:02:30,900  -->  00:02:33,900
of many services in AWS for all the regions,
56

56

00:02:33,900  -->  00:02:36,690
and of course one of these is EC2 instance connect.
57

57

00:02:36,690  -->  00:02:40,110
And is in this instance for the region, US East one,
58

58

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:42,600
we have this IP prefix right here.
59

59

00:02:42,600  -->  00:02:44,460
So hopefully now you really understand
60

60

00:02:44,460  -->  00:02:46,560
how EC2 instance connect works.
61

61

00:02:46,560  -->  00:02:49,510
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
