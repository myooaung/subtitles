00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:01,680
<v Instructor>So just a short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,680  -->  00:00:05,190
on this feature in CloudWatch called Contributor Insights.
3

3

00:00:05,190  -->  00:00:07,560
So this allows you to analyze log data,
4

4

00:00:07,560  -->  00:00:08,610
and then you create time series
5

5

00:00:08,610  -->  00:00:10,590
that will display contributor data.
6

6

00:00:10,590  -->  00:00:12,480
And what is contributor data?
7

7

00:00:12,480  -->  00:00:16,140
Well, this is the use case to find the top talkers,
8

8

00:00:16,140  -->  00:00:19,200
for example, on your network and to understand who is what
9

9

00:00:19,200  -->  00:00:21,030
and what is impacting system performance.
10

10

00:00:21,030  -->  00:00:24,090
So for example, if you have network data
11

11

00:00:24,090  -->  00:00:25,860
and logs on CloudWatch Logs,
12

12

00:00:25,860  -->  00:00:28,050
then this allows you to find the bad host,
13

13

00:00:28,050  -->  00:00:30,240
to identify the heaviest network users,
14

14

00:00:30,240  -->  00:00:32,670
or to find the URLs that generate the most errors.
15

15

00:00:32,670  -->  00:00:35,610
So this is about ranking and doing some computation.
16

16

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:38,430
This works for any AWS-generated logs,
17

17

00:00:38,430  -->  00:00:40,230
so it could be your VPC flow logs,
18

18

00:00:40,230  -->  00:00:42,000
your DNS logs, and whatever.
19

19

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:45,360
And you can use the built-in rules created by AWS
20

20

00:00:45,360  -->  00:00:47,280
or you can build your own rules.
21

21

00:00:47,280  -->  00:00:49,020
So let me give you a concrete example
22

22

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:50,430
for you to understand this feature.
23

23

00:00:50,430  -->  00:00:53,190
So let's say we have our VPC flow logs,
24

24

00:00:53,190  -->  00:00:55,260
then we are going to export them
25

25

00:00:55,260  -->  00:00:57,630
and stream them into CloudWatch logs,
26

26

00:00:57,630  -->  00:00:58,830
and then we're going to use
27

27

00:00:58,830  -->  00:01:00,960
the CloudWatch Contributor Insights
28

28

00:01:00,960  -->  00:01:03,420
to figure out the top 10 IP addresses
29

29

00:01:03,420  -->  00:01:05,520
on my network, because that may indicate
30

30

00:01:05,520  -->  00:01:08,250
that some EC2 instances are not behaving correctly
31

31

00:01:08,250  -->  00:01:10,140
or that we're being under attack.
32

32

00:01:10,140  -->  00:01:12,840
So hopefully, you understand the value of this feature.
33

33

00:01:12,840  -->  00:01:15,963
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
