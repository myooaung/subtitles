00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.200
<v Instructor>One very short lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:03.210
about data wiping on EBS volumes.
3

3

00:00:03.210  -->  00:00:04.920
So there is a common misconception
4

4

00:00:04.920  -->  00:00:06.810
and the exam may test you on it.
5

5

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:09.570
So if you delete an EBS volume,
6

6

00:00:09.570  -->  00:00:13.020
then the underlying physical block storage used
7

7

00:00:13.020  -->  00:00:16.650
by this deleted EBS volume is going to be overwritten
8

8

00:00:16.650  -->  00:00:21.360
by AWS with zeros before it is allocated to a new volume,
9

9

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:24.540
meaning that the data will be wiped by AWS.
10

10

00:00:24.540  -->  00:00:27.420
So before you delete an EBS volume, you don't need
11

11

00:00:27.420  -->  00:00:30.300
to manually wipe data that doesn't make any sense.
12

12

00:00:30.300  -->  00:00:32.670
So the process is you have an EBS volume full
13

13

00:00:32.670  -->  00:00:35.610
of blocks, full of data, you delete it,
14

14

00:00:35.610  -->  00:00:36.903
AWS will reclaim that EBS volume.
15

15

00:00:36.903  -->  00:00:39.780
It's going to wipe data by adding zeros
16

16

00:00:39.780  -->  00:00:42.210
and then once EBS volume is full of zeros,
17

17

00:00:42.210  -->  00:00:43.380
then it can be assigned
18

18

00:00:43.380  -->  00:00:46.590
to another customer and it will be ready to use.
19

19

00:00:46.590  -->  00:00:47.940
So that's it for this lecture.
20

20

00:00:47.940  -->  00:00:51.033
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
