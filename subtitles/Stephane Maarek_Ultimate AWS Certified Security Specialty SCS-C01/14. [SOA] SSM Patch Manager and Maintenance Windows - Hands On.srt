00:00:00,910  -->  00:00:02,070
<v Instructor>So on the left-hand side,</v>
2

2

00:00:02,070  -->  00:00:04,260
I can go into Patch Manager
3

3

00:00:04,260  -->  00:00:08,420
to automate patching of my instances, okay.
4

4

00:00:08,420  -->  00:00:10,647
So I will click on "Patch now."
5

5

00:00:13,100  -->  00:00:16,080
And this is to apply a patch to my instances.
6

6

00:00:16,080  -->  00:00:19,260
So we can have a scan, or a scan and install.
7

7

00:00:19,260  -->  00:00:20,550
And do we want to reboot
8

8

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:23,050
if we want to patch our instances?
9

9

00:00:23,050  -->  00:00:25,380
And then what instance do we want to patch?
10

10

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:27,000
So we can patch all instances
11

11

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:29,500
or we can patch only some specific targets
12

12

00:00:29,500  -->  00:00:31,960
based on tags, resource groups,
13

13

00:00:31,960  -->  00:00:35,220
or specify the instances manually, okay?
14

14

00:00:35,220  -->  00:00:37,270
Then patching log storage can be done
15

15

00:00:37,270  -->  00:00:40,690
and can be placed within an S3 bucket of your choice.
16

16

00:00:40,690  -->  00:00:42,660
And then you can use Lifecycle hooks
17

17

00:00:42,660  -->  00:00:44,360
if you want at certain points during the patching
18

18

00:00:44,360  -->  00:00:46,810
to perform some complex patching scenarios.
19

19

00:00:46,810  -->  00:00:49,420
So this is one way of doing things, okay.
20

20

00:00:49,420  -->  00:00:52,980
But you can also view the predefined patch baseline.
21

21

00:00:52,980  -->  00:00:55,300
And this is all the baseline that you have for different OS.
22

22

00:00:55,300  -->  00:00:57,700
For example, the Red Hat patch baseline,
23

23

00:00:57,700  -->  00:01:00,720
the centOS Patch Baseline, the Windows and so on.
24

24

00:01:00,720  -->  00:01:03,070
And whether or not they're default baseline.
25

25

00:01:03,070  -->  00:01:04,980
So some are yes and some are no.
26

26

00:01:04,980  -->  00:01:06,690
I don't want to go too deep into it
27

27

00:01:06,690  -->  00:01:08,600
because I don't want to overwhelm you with details,
28

28

00:01:08,600  -->  00:01:10,100
but just so you have a quick overview
29

29

00:01:10,100  -->  00:01:11,660
of how Patch Manager work.
30

30

00:01:11,660  -->  00:01:13,960
So these are all the patches distributed
31

31

00:01:13,960  -->  00:01:16,450
for Windows and for Amazon Linux 2
32

32

00:01:16,450  -->  00:01:18,000
and their release date,
33

33

00:01:18,000  -->  00:01:19,550
whether or not security,
34

34

00:01:19,550  -->  00:01:22,330
and the level and whether critical and so on.
35

35

00:01:22,330  -->  00:01:24,080
So whenever you create your patch group,
36

36

00:01:24,080  -->  00:01:25,330
then it will appear here
37

37

00:01:25,330  -->  00:01:28,920
and it will be associated with a specific patch baseline.
38

38

00:01:28,920  -->  00:01:30,490
And you can look at reporting
39

39

00:01:30,490  -->  00:01:33,140
to see if an instance is compliant or not
40

40

00:01:33,140  -->  00:01:34,800
with its patches.
41

41

00:01:34,800  -->  00:01:37,040
And finally, if you want to have a look
42

42

00:01:37,040  -->  00:01:38,150
at maintenance windows,
43

43

00:01:38,150  -->  00:01:39,790
they're right here on the left hand side.
44

44

00:01:39,790  -->  00:01:40,680
So under maintenance windows,
45

45

00:01:40,680  -->  00:01:43,500
we can create a maintenance window to run our patches.
46

46

00:01:43,500  -->  00:01:48,403
So I'll call this one Demo Maintenance Window,
47

47

00:01:49,376  -->  00:01:51,360
and then we allow unregistered targets
48

48

00:01:51,360  -->  00:01:53,500
to be under this window.
49

49

00:01:53,500  -->  00:01:54,690
Where do we want,
50

50

00:01:54,690  -->  00:01:57,300
how far, how often do we want to run this window?
51

51

00:01:57,300  -->  00:01:59,210
So it could be a Cron schedule, a rate,
52

52

00:01:59,210  -->  00:02:00,190
or a Cron Rate expression.
53

53

00:02:00,190  -->  00:02:01,890
So we can say daily,
54

54

00:02:01,890  -->  00:02:06,320
you start every day at zero three, so 3:00 AM.
55

55

00:02:06,320  -->  00:02:10,500
And it's going to be a two-hour maintenance window, okay.
56

56

00:02:10,500  -->  00:02:12,990
And stop initiating task while zero hour
57

57

00:02:12,990  -->  00:02:13,910
before the window closed.
58

58

00:02:13,910  -->  00:02:16,570
But you can say one hour if you wanted to.
59

59

00:02:16,570  -->  00:02:19,490
We can say start time and end time if you wanted to,
60

60

00:02:19,490  -->  00:02:20,720
the schedule.
61

61

00:02:20,720  -->  00:02:23,590
And then we can create this maintenance window, okay.
62

62

00:02:23,590  -->  00:02:24,720
And within this window,
63

63

00:02:24,720  -->  00:02:27,560
what we can do is that we can register specific tasks
64

64

00:02:27,560  -->  00:02:28,760
that will be run.
65

65

00:02:28,760  -->  00:02:31,180
And one of this tasks, for example, is, could be
66

66

00:02:31,180  -->  00:02:32,700
a run command.
67

67

00:02:32,700  -->  00:02:34,040
So I'll call it Patch
68

68

00:02:34,900  -->  00:02:38,100
and the document to apply itself
69

69

00:02:38,100  -->  00:02:40,197
is going to be AWS-RunPatch.
70

70

00:02:43,494  -->  00:02:45,670
And we have the Run Patch baseline right here
71

71

00:02:45,670  -->  00:02:49,490
in documents that we can register within our targets.
72

72

00:02:49,490  -->  00:02:54,140
And we can select unregistered targets,
73

73

00:02:54,140  -->  00:02:57,430
for example, these three, to apply this.
74

74

00:02:57,430  -->  00:03:00,180
And obviously, thanks to the maintenance windows,
75

75

00:03:00,180  -->  00:03:03,700
we can specify concurrency and the error thresholds.
76

76

00:03:03,700  -->  00:03:04,533
Hopefully this works,
77

77

00:03:04,533  -->  00:03:07,910
obviously one target at a time and zero for errors,
78

78

00:03:07,910  -->  00:03:08,900
and that should do the trick.
79

79

00:03:08,900  -->  00:03:10,350
So let's see if I can just go ahead
80

80

00:03:10,350  -->  00:03:11,430
and click on register run command.
81

81

00:03:11,430  -->  00:03:12,263
Here we go.
82

82

00:03:12,263  -->  00:03:14,410
So now that means that within my maintenance window,
83

83

00:03:14,410  -->  00:03:17,190
this run patch baseline will be run,
84

84

00:03:17,190  -->  00:03:19,450
and it will happen only during this window.
85

85

00:03:19,450  -->  00:03:20,930
So this is just a way to do things.
86

86

00:03:20,930  -->  00:03:22,890
I'm not going to go ahead with this maintenance window,
87

87

00:03:22,890  -->  00:03:26,330
but I want to show you a high level of how patch manager
88

88

00:03:26,330  -->  00:03:27,970
and the maintenance windows were working.
89

89

00:03:27,970  -->  00:03:28,803
And to clean that up,
90

90

00:03:28,803  -->  00:03:30,920
you can delete this maintenance window
91

91

00:03:30,920  -->  00:03:32,050
and you'll be good to go.
92

92

00:03:32,050  -->  00:03:32,883
So that's it.
93

93

00:03:32,883  -->  00:03:33,716
I hope you liked it.
94

94

00:03:33,716  -->  00:03:35,430
And I will see you in the next lecture.
