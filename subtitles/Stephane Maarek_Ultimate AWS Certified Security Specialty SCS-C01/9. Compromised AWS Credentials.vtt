00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:02.220
<v ->So now let's look at what to do in case</v>
2

2

00:00:02.220  -->  00:00:06.390
of compromised AWS credentials, IAM roles and accounts.
3

3

00:00:06.390  -->  00:00:09.630
So we have an IAM, and in IAM we have a user
4

4

00:00:09.630  -->  00:00:10.770
that has been compromised.
5

5

00:00:10.770  -->  00:00:12.630
So GuardDuty can detect it,
6

6

00:00:12.630  -->  00:00:15.360
and figures out that some credentials have been compromised
7

7

00:00:15.360  -->  00:00:17.430
and so therefore the first thing we have to do
8

8

00:00:17.430  -->  00:00:20.040
is to rotate the exposed credentials
9

9

00:00:20.040  -->  00:00:22.560
so that no one can use them in the future.
10

10

00:00:22.560  -->  00:00:23.393
On top of it,
11

11

00:00:23.393  -->  00:00:25.230
even though security credentials have been exposed
12

12

00:00:25.230  -->  00:00:29.430
and rotated, you need to invalidate them
13

13

00:00:29.430  -->  00:00:32.670
by attaching an explicit deny policy
14

14

00:00:32.670  -->  00:00:36.420
to the affected IAM user with an STS date condition.
15

15

00:00:36.420  -->  00:00:37.650
This is something I go over
16

16

00:00:37.650  -->  00:00:39.510
in the IAM section of this course,
17

17

00:00:39.510  -->  00:00:40.560
but just so you know,
18

18

00:00:40.560  -->  00:00:43.980
by attaching this policy to the IAM user
19

19

00:00:43.980  -->  00:00:46.560
then any previously issued credentials
20

20

00:00:46.560  -->  00:00:48.630
before the date of today will not be able
21

21

00:00:48.630  -->  00:00:50.820
to perform any actions in your account.
22

22

00:00:50.820  -->  00:00:53.160
So this is how to mitigate it.
23

23

00:00:53.160  -->  00:00:54.240
On top of it,
24

24

00:00:54.240  -->  00:00:56.520
because the credentials may have been used,
25

25

00:00:56.520  -->  00:00:58.410
you need to check the CloudTrail logs
26

26

00:00:58.410  -->  00:01:00.690
for any unauthorized activity.
27

27

00:01:00.690  -->  00:01:03.420
And then you need to review these resources in case,
28

28

00:01:03.420  -->  00:01:04.920
while there has been unauthorized activity
29

29

00:01:04.920  -->  00:01:08.940
such as deletion of resources or modifications.
30

30

00:01:08.940  -->  00:01:12.000
And finally, always verify your account information
31

31

00:01:12.000  -->  00:01:13.890
because it could have changed.
32

32

00:01:13.890  -->  00:01:15.780
Now, if it's an IAM role that is compromised,
33

33

00:01:15.780  -->  00:01:19.380
for example you have enabled active directory integration
34

34

00:01:19.380  -->  00:01:21.240
or you assume a role, or whatever,
35

35

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:23.190
then again you need to identify
36

36

00:01:23.190  -->  00:01:25.320
what is the compromised IAM role.
37

37

00:01:25.320  -->  00:01:27.360
Then the same technique as before,
38

38

00:01:27.360  -->  00:01:31.260
we attach an explicit deny policy to deny any action
39

39

00:01:31.260  -->  00:01:33.660
for tokens issued before today's date.
40

40

00:01:33.660  -->  00:01:36.090
So again, we'll see this in the next section.
41

41

00:01:36.090  -->  00:01:38.760
We should revoke any access to the identity
42

42

00:01:38.760  -->  00:01:40.140
in the linked active directory.
43

43

00:01:40.140  -->  00:01:42.000
For example, if we're using SSO
44

44

00:01:42.000  -->  00:01:44.340
and the user was compromised there.
45

45

00:01:44.340  -->  00:01:45.750
We need to check for CloudTrail logs
46

46

00:01:45.750  -->  00:01:47.610
for unauthorized activity,
47

47

00:01:47.610  -->  00:01:50.670
review the resources and verify the account information.
48

48

00:01:50.670  -->  00:01:53.280
So some similar steps as before.
49

49

00:01:53.280  -->  00:01:56.730
And what if it's your entire account that get compromised?
50

50

00:01:56.730  -->  00:01:57.630
Then of course,
51

51

00:01:57.630  -->  00:02:02.630
delete and rotate any and all access keys of AWS.
52

52

00:02:03.180  -->  00:02:05.910
Also, make sure that you rotate and delete
53

53

00:02:05.910  -->  00:02:08.370
any unauthorized IAM user credentials,
54

54

00:02:08.370  -->  00:02:12.000
and to rotate all of the existing IAM users passwords.
55

55

00:02:12.000  -->  00:02:14.010
So it's question mark I have to say.
56

56

00:02:14.010  -->  00:02:17.100
Then delete and rotate all EC2 key pairs
57

57

00:02:17.100  -->  00:02:18.960
so that they cannot be used in the future
58

58

00:02:18.960  -->  00:02:21.300
to SSH into your instances.
59

59

00:02:21.300  -->  00:02:24.450
Check CloudTrail logs for unauthorized activity,
60

60

00:02:24.450  -->  00:02:26.910
and then review all of your resources
61

61

00:02:26.910  -->  00:02:28.410
for deletions and so on.
62

62

00:02:28.410  -->  00:02:31.830
And finally, of course, review your account information.
63

63

00:02:31.830  -->  00:02:32.850
So that's it.
64

64

00:02:32.850  -->  00:02:35.850
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
