00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:03,030
<v Lecturer>So, let me show you quickly WAF, Shield</v>
2

2

00:00:03,030  -->  00:00:04,620
and Firewall Manager.
3

3

00:00:04,620  -->  00:00:08,760
So, if you go into the console and you type WAF and Shield,
4

4

00:00:08,760  -->  00:00:10,320
you arrive in this UI.
5

5

00:00:10,320  -->  00:00:12,120
So we have WAF on the left hand side,
6

6

00:00:12,120  -->  00:00:15,660
Shield in here and we have Firewall Manager in here.
7

7

00:00:15,660  -->  00:00:18,030
So WAF helps you protect your web applications
8

8

00:00:18,030  -->  00:00:21,480
from common web exploits at the layer seven
9

9

00:00:21,480  -->  00:00:23,430
So it's for your Amazon API gateway,
10

10

00:00:23,430  -->  00:00:24,720
your CloudFront distributions
11

11

00:00:24,720  -->  00:00:27,420
or an Application Load Balancer.
12

12

00:00:27,420  -->  00:00:28,350
So then what you would do
13

13

00:00:28,350  -->  00:00:31,380
is that you would create a web ACL out of it.
14

14

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:34,437
So we'll give it a name, 'Demo Web ACL',
15

15

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:38,670
and then whether or not it's for a regional resource,
16

16

00:00:38,670  -->  00:00:41,340
such as your ALB, API gateway or others,
17

17

00:00:41,340  -->  00:00:43,290
or if it's a CloudFront distribution,
18

18

00:00:43,290  -->  00:00:45,840
in which case it is going to be global for CloudFront
19

19

00:00:45,840  -->  00:00:48,570
and only in U.S. East one.
20

20

00:00:48,570  -->  00:00:50,760
So, let's go back to regional resource
21

21

00:00:50,760  -->  00:00:54,180
and then I'm going to say, this is going to go into
22

22

00:00:54,180  -->  00:00:58,110
say for example the Ireland region of Europe,
23

23

00:00:58,110  -->  00:01:00,813
and this is again my 'Demo Web ACL.
24

24

00:01:01,740  -->  00:01:02,820
Okay.
25

25

00:01:02,820  -->  00:01:05,280
So, we can associate resources with it,
26

26

00:01:05,280  -->  00:01:08,160
so which resources do we want to protect with this?
27

27

00:01:08,160  -->  00:01:09,750
So I don't have any ALB right now
28

28

00:01:09,750  -->  00:01:12,600
but this is where you would add AWS resources to it
29

29

00:01:12,600  -->  00:01:13,920
by just clicking on this button
30

30

00:01:13,920  -->  00:01:17,610
and finding the right resource to protect with your web ACL.
31

31

00:01:17,610  -->  00:01:19,260
Next, you need to add some rules.
32

32

00:01:19,260  -->  00:01:22,200
So, you can add many rules into your web ACL.
33

33

00:01:22,200  -->  00:01:25,380
So, we can add managed rule groups or create your own rules.
34

34

00:01:25,380  -->  00:01:26,610
So, what about managed rules?
35

35

00:01:26,610  -->  00:01:28,380
Well, you can have a look at the categories.
36

36

00:01:28,380  -->  00:01:30,300
You have some coming from AWS
37

37

00:01:30,300  -->  00:01:32,670
but also some coming from partners.
38

38

00:01:32,670  -->  00:01:34,350
And if you look at AWS,
39

39

00:01:34,350  -->  00:01:36,240
we can have, for example, a bot control rule
40

40

00:01:36,240  -->  00:01:39,510
to prevent bots from accessing our application.
41

41

00:01:39,510  -->  00:01:42,390
Or we can have a look at the Amazon IP reputation list
42

42

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:45,570
to only have access to IP that are reputable
43

43

00:01:45,570  -->  00:01:47,160
into our application.
44

44

00:01:47,160  -->  00:01:49,290
Or we can block for example, anonymous IPs,
45

45

00:01:49,290  -->  00:01:50,760
so let's add this one.
46

46

00:01:50,760  -->  00:01:53,608
Here, we're going to block IPs coming from VPNs,
47

47

00:01:53,608  -->  00:01:56,190
from proxies and so on.
48

48

00:01:56,190  -->  00:01:58,140
And let's have known bad inputs
49

49

00:01:58,140  -->  00:02:00,420
so we know that like some inputs are bad
50

50

00:02:00,420  -->  00:02:02,070
so let's block them as well.
51

51

00:02:02,070  -->  00:02:04,743
So, we add all these rules, okay?
52

52

00:02:04,743  -->  00:02:07,140
And as you can see, each rule has a capacity.
53

53

00:02:07,140  -->  00:02:10,410
So, the maximum capacity is 1500,
54

54

00:02:10,410  -->  00:02:12,210
this is so that you don't have too many rules
55

55

00:02:12,210  -->  00:02:13,560
on the web ACL.
56

56

00:02:13,560  -->  00:02:17,850
So, now I'm protected against anonymous IPs and bad inputs.
57

57

00:02:17,850  -->  00:02:18,750
Okay.
58

58

00:02:18,750  -->  00:02:21,870
So what happens if it doesn't match any rule
59

59

00:02:21,870  -->  00:02:23,760
then the default action is to allow,
60

60

00:02:23,760  -->  00:02:25,350
else it will be blocked.
61

61

00:02:25,350  -->  00:02:27,270
So, let's click on next.
62

62

00:02:27,270  -->  00:02:29,280
Here, we can set up the rule priorities.
63

63

00:02:29,280  -->  00:02:32,340
So, do you want to have first the bad inputs rule set
64

64

00:02:32,340  -->  00:02:35,280
or the anonymous IP list, so you can change this.
65

65

00:02:35,280  -->  00:02:38,130
Then you would have metrics associated with it.
66

66

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:41,850
And finally, you could go ahead and create this web ACL.
67

67

00:02:41,850  -->  00:02:44,370
So, this is a created, and if you wanted to
68

68

00:02:44,370  -->  00:02:45,933
you could associate it with your ALB,
69

69

00:02:45,933  -->  00:02:47,790
your API gateway and so on.
70

70

00:02:47,790  -->  00:02:50,380
So, this is for WAF and next.
71

71

00:02:50,380  -->  00:02:53,220
And also in here, you could set up IP sets
72

72

00:02:53,220  -->  00:02:56,297
and this is where you would set up your IP addresses, okay?
73

73

00:02:56,297  -->  00:02:58,230
One per line inside your format,
74

74

00:02:58,230  -->  00:03:01,166
run what to block or what to allow in.
75

75

00:03:01,166  -->  00:03:02,943
Okay, so next we have Shield.
76

76

00:03:05,430  -->  00:03:08,970
So, Shield is to get DDoS protection
77

77

00:03:08,970  -->  00:03:11,160
and if I click on subscribe to Shield Advanced,
78

78

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:14,490
I'm going to pay $3,000 per month, which I will not do.
79

79

00:03:14,490  -->  00:03:16,260
So, the idea is that you just know
80

80

00:03:16,260  -->  00:03:17,550
that Shield is for DDoS protection
81

81

00:03:17,550  -->  00:03:19,170
and we just don't experiment with it
82

82

00:03:19,170  -->  00:03:21,912
otherwise we're gonna have a bad surprise.
83

83

00:03:21,912  -->  00:03:25,590
So, I'm going to scroll down and go to Firewall Manager.
84

84

00:03:25,590  -->  00:03:27,270
So, Firewall Manager is to have
85

85

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:30,990
centralized security management of your rules.
86

86

00:03:30,990  -->  00:03:32,190
So, you can create a policy,
87

87

00:03:32,190  -->  00:03:34,950
but again a policy will cost you $100 per month.
88

88

00:03:34,950  -->  00:03:36,900
So. I will not display this
89

89

00:03:36,900  -->  00:03:39,000
but the idea is that all these policies
90

90

00:03:39,000  -->  00:03:43,020
will be applied to all accounts across your organization.
91

91

00:03:43,020  -->  00:03:45,150
So if you wanted to just go through policy,
92

92

00:03:45,150  -->  00:03:47,100
you can have it look quickly, the options.
93

93

00:03:47,100  -->  00:03:49,920
So you can apply a policy for WAF, for Shield Advanced,
94

94

00:03:49,920  -->  00:03:52,980
for security groups, network firewalls, or more.
95

95

00:03:52,980  -->  00:03:54,540
And so this is WAF,
96

96

00:03:54,540  -->  00:03:57,450
let's apply to, for example the Ireland region.
97

97

00:03:57,450  -->  00:03:58,890
And if I were to do so
98

98

00:03:58,890  -->  00:04:02,370
then I would be able to define a WAF policy
99

99

00:04:02,370  -->  00:04:07,020
for all my accounts for the Ireland region.
100

100

00:04:07,020  -->  00:04:09,930
So you could configure the rules here
101

101

00:04:09,930  -->  00:04:12,450
and then you could have more configuration and so on.
102

102

00:04:12,450  -->  00:04:15,390
So hopefully you get the idea of these three services
103

103

00:04:15,390  -->  00:04:18,030
and you understand how they compliment each other.
104

104

00:04:18,030  -->  00:04:19,260
I hope you liked it
105

105

00:04:19,260  -->  00:04:21,210
and I will see you in the next lecture.
