00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:03.300
<v ->So now let's talk about VPC Endpoint Policies.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.300  -->  00:00:05.820
So they look like this, and as the name indicates,
3

3

00:00:05.820  -->  00:00:08.370
they are attached to VPC endpoints.
4

4

00:00:08.370  -->  00:00:11.400
So in this example, we have a VPC endpoint policy
5

5

00:00:11.400  -->  00:00:13.770
which is saying that anyone that accesses it,
6

6

00:00:13.770  -->  00:00:18.090
so anyone because principal star that does a list bucket,
7

7

00:00:18.090  -->  00:00:21.870
get bucket, or put objects, so three API calls,
8

8

00:00:21.870  -->  00:00:24.060
is going to be authorized on the bucket itself
9

9

00:00:24.060  -->  00:00:26.160
as well as any objects within the bucket.
10

10

00:00:26.160  -->  00:00:27.750
That's the resources part.
11

11

00:00:27.750  -->  00:00:31.110
And then the conditions is that the principal ARN
12

12

00:00:31.110  -->  00:00:35.070
has to be that of a role named test role.
13

13

00:00:35.070  -->  00:00:37.470
And the principal in the effect is allowed.
14

14

00:00:37.470  -->  00:00:40.590
So meaning that this endpoint policy
15

15

00:00:40.590  -->  00:00:44.070
is allowing a specific role to access it
16

16

00:00:44.070  -->  00:00:47.850
and to do three kinds of operations on one specific bucket
17

17

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:49.200
and its objects.
18

18

00:00:49.200  -->  00:00:50.460
So it's quite detailed.
19

19

00:00:50.460  -->  00:00:53.130
And of course, the VPC endpoint policy will control
20

20

00:00:53.130  -->  00:00:55.410
which principles can use the VPC endpoint
21

21

00:00:55.410  -->  00:00:57.060
to access services.
22

22

00:00:57.060  -->  00:01:00.900
Now these can be attached to both interface endpoints
23

23

00:01:00.900  -->  00:01:02.670
and gateway endpoints.
24

24

00:01:02.670  -->  00:01:04.380
And as seen in this example,
25

25

00:01:04.380  -->  00:01:08.130
this restricts specific API calls on specific resources.
26

26

00:01:08.130  -->  00:01:10.601
One thing to note is that it does not override
27

27

00:01:10.601  -->  00:01:13.770
or replace identity based policies
28

28

00:01:13.770  -->  00:01:15.780
or service specific policies.
29

29

00:01:15.780  -->  00:01:19.860
So even if the VPC endpoint policy is allowing
30

30

00:01:19.860  -->  00:01:22.500
this role to use the VPC endpoint
31

31

00:01:22.500  -->  00:01:25.470
it does not mean that it's going to authorize the API call
32

32

00:01:25.470  -->  00:01:26.970
on the target resource.
33

33

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:29.160
For this. we'll still need the IAM role,
34

34

00:01:29.160  -->  00:01:32.130
or the policy or the resource based policy,
35

35

00:01:32.130  -->  00:01:35.310
for example industry buckets, to authorize this call.
36

36

00:01:35.310  -->  00:01:37.020
We'll see this in a second.
37

37

00:01:37.020  -->  00:01:39.330
The benefit of it though is that we can control
38

38

00:01:39.330  -->  00:01:40.620
from a network perspective
39

39

00:01:40.620  -->  00:01:43.380
who can access our buckets privately.
40

40

00:01:43.380  -->  00:01:48.380
Now, you should note that the AWS principle org ID condition
41

41

00:01:48.780  -->  00:01:50.670
which is something that can come up in the exam,
42

42

00:01:50.670  -->  00:01:53.243
can be used to restrict access only
43

43

00:01:53.243  -->  00:01:55.800
within the organization, therefore,
44

44

00:01:55.800  -->  00:01:57.720
guaranteeing that your VPC endpoint
45

45

00:01:57.720  -->  00:02:01.200
is only used by accounts of your organization.
46

46

00:02:01.200  -->  00:02:02.940
So let's take an example.
47

47

00:02:02.940  -->  00:02:05.580
In this example, we have an SQS queue
48

48

00:02:05.580  -->  00:02:07.110
and we wanna guarantee two things.
49

49

00:02:07.110  -->  00:02:09.150
Number one, that it is accessible from within
50

50

00:02:09.150  -->  00:02:10.987
our organization, and number two,
51

51

00:02:10.987  -->  00:02:15.030
that it will be only accessed through the VPC endpoint.
52

52

00:02:15.030  -->  00:02:16.500
So how do we do this?
53

53

00:02:16.500  -->  00:02:20.700
Well, first of all, we have to attach an SQS resource policy
54

54

00:02:20.700  -->  00:02:22.320
to our SQS queue.
55

55

00:02:22.320  -->  00:02:24.243
And if we have a look at this resource policy,
56

56

00:02:24.243  -->  00:02:27.570
we're saying that we allow anyone to send a message
57

57

00:02:27.570  -->  00:02:29.040
and receive a message
58

58

00:02:29.040  -->  00:02:32.906
as long as the target queue is the resource of the ARN
59

59

00:02:32.906  -->  00:02:34.200
of the queue itself.
60

60

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:36.660
And then the conditions strings equal is saying
61

61

00:02:36.660  -->  00:02:39.184
only if the source VPC endpoint
62

62

00:02:39.184  -->  00:02:42.900
is the VPC endpoint from before then this is allowed.
63

63

00:02:42.900  -->  00:02:46.620
Therefore, if a request comes to the queue on its own
64

64

00:02:46.620  -->  00:02:48.840
without the VPC endpoint, it's going to be refused
65

65

00:02:48.840  -->  00:02:50.310
because of that condition.
66

66

00:02:50.310  -->  00:02:53.070
So here we have tightly linked the VPC endpoint
67

67

00:02:53.070  -->  00:02:57.270
to the SQS queue, and then we can add a VPC endpoint policy
68

68

00:02:57.270  -->  00:03:00.750
saying that the request are only allowed from anything
69

69

00:03:00.750  -->  00:03:04.804
by anywhere to anyone as long as the account ID
70

70

00:03:04.804  -->  00:03:07.170
that is making this request,
71

71

00:03:07.170  -->  00:03:09.690
so the user belongs to an account ID, for example,
72

72

00:03:09.690  -->  00:03:14.220
also belongs to an organization with a principle org ID
73

73

00:03:14.220  -->  00:03:18.000
of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and so on.
74

74

00:03:18.000  -->  00:03:21.300
So this effectively guarantees that all member accounts
75

75

00:03:21.300  -->  00:03:24.720
through this VPC endpoint can access my SQS queue
76

76

00:03:24.720  -->  00:03:27.360
and do a send message and receive message.
77

77

00:03:27.360  -->  00:03:29.010
Hopefully that makes sense into the power
78

78

00:03:29.010  -->  00:03:31.230
of VPC endpoint policies.
79

79

00:03:31.230  -->  00:03:33.990
So we'll see the authorization logic
80

80

00:03:33.990  -->  00:03:37.050
in greater detail in a future section.
81

81

00:03:37.050  -->  00:03:39.360
But just to give you an idea of how this works,
82

82

00:03:39.360  -->  00:03:43.740
so say we have a VPC endpoint policy and an IAM user
83

83

00:03:43.740  -->  00:03:46.170
then they're both going to be evaluated.
84

84

00:03:46.170  -->  00:03:49.290
So if an IAM user makes a request from a VPC
85

85

00:03:49.290  -->  00:03:52.740
through a VPC endpoint and then into, for example,
86

86

00:03:52.740  -->  00:03:55.320
a resource and SQS queue whatever you want,
87

87

00:03:55.320  -->  00:03:57.828
then first of all this VPC endpoint policy
88

88

00:03:57.828  -->  00:04:00.300
must have an explicit allow.
89

89

00:04:00.300  -->  00:04:02.670
Otherwise, the IAM user will not be able to go
90

90

00:04:02.670  -->  00:04:04.380
through the VPC endpoints.
91

91

00:04:04.380  -->  00:04:07.604
And then even if it's allowed in the VPC endpoint policy,
92

92

00:04:07.604  -->  00:04:10.590
then you must have, for example,
93

93

00:04:10.590  -->  00:04:13.440
on your IAM policy attached to your IAM user,
94

94

00:04:13.440  -->  00:04:17.040
you must have an explicit allow and no explicit deny.
95

95

00:04:17.040  -->  00:04:19.320
And of course, you must not have an explicit deny
96

96

00:04:19.320  -->  00:04:22.050
on your VPC endpoint policy either.
97

97

00:04:22.050  -->  00:04:23.850
So what I wanted to show you here,
98

98

00:04:23.850  -->  00:04:26.460
is that they're both evaluated regardless,
99

99

00:04:26.460  -->  00:04:29.640
is that even if the VPC endpoint policies allows it,
100

100

00:04:29.640  -->  00:04:33.270
there is still protection at the IAM user level,
101

101

00:04:33.270  -->  00:04:36.030
or the resource policy as we'll see right now.
102

102

00:04:36.030  -->  00:04:38.940
So in this slightly more complicated use case
103

103

00:04:38.940  -->  00:04:41.030
where we have a VPC endpoint policy,
104

104

00:04:41.030  -->  00:04:45.240
a resource policy, for example, an S3 buckets policy,
105

105

00:04:45.240  -->  00:04:47.370
as well as an identity based policy, for example,
106

106

00:04:47.370  -->  00:04:49.770
an IAM role, then what happens?
107

107

00:04:49.770  -->  00:04:51.780
Again, we need to be explicitly allowed
108

108

00:04:51.780  -->  00:04:53.610
through the VPC endpoint policy.
109

109

00:04:53.610  -->  00:04:55.230
There is no way around it.
110

110

00:04:55.230  -->  00:04:59.040
And then the combination of resource policy
111

111

00:04:59.040  -->  00:05:03.150
and identity based policy must give you an explicit allow
112

112

00:05:03.150  -->  00:05:04.560
and no explicit deny.
113

113

00:05:04.560  -->  00:05:08.460
So if the resource policy alone authorizes the IAM role,
114

114

00:05:08.460  -->  00:05:10.980
that's perfect, or if the IAM role itself
115

115

00:05:10.980  -->  00:05:13.560
has enough permissions to access the resource,
116

116

00:05:13.560  -->  00:05:17.370
that's perfect as well as long as there is no explicit deny.
117

117

00:05:17.370  -->  00:05:19.530
All right, so that's it for this lecture.
118

118

00:05:19.530  -->  00:05:22.530
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
