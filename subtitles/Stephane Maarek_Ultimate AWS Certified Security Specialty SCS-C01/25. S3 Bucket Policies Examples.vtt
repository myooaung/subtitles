00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:01.560
<v Instructor>So, I'm just going to show you</v>
2

2

00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:05.820
a few S3 Bucket Policies that can be helpful for the exam.
3

3

00:00:05.820  -->  00:00:07.290
You may have seen them already,
4

4

00:00:07.290  -->  00:00:08.880
but it's good to see them one more time.
5

5

00:00:08.880  -->  00:00:11.490
So, the first one is to force HTTPS
6

6

00:00:11.490  -->  00:00:14.910
going into Amazon S3 to get in-flight encryption.
7

7

00:00:14.910  -->  00:00:18.090
You would have a Deny statement in your bucket policy
8

8

00:00:18.090  -->  00:00:21.450
for all actions if the condition, right here,
9

9

00:00:21.450  -->  00:00:24.330
says that the SecureTransport is false.
10

10

00:00:24.330  -->  00:00:26.520
So, that's a classic one for the exam.
11

11

00:00:26.520  -->  00:00:30.240
And the second one is, how do you force the specific KMS key
12

12

00:00:30.240  -->  00:00:32.130
on the S3 bucket for encryption?
13

13

00:00:32.130  -->  00:00:34.320
Well, again, you would have a Deny statement
14

14

00:00:34.320  -->  00:00:36.330
and you're saying, "Hey, I want to make sure
15

15

00:00:36.330  -->  00:00:40.770
that this header right here is equal to aws:kms."
16

16

00:00:40.770  -->  00:00:44.100
And then if you want to have a specific KMS key ID,
17

17

00:00:44.100  -->  00:00:46.320
you can have the exact same thing, but this time,
18

18

00:00:46.320  -->  00:00:51.320
the x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id condition
19

19

00:00:51.510  -->  00:00:54.900
should be equal to the ARN of your KMS key.
20

20

00:00:54.900  -->  00:00:56.160
All right, that's it for this lecture.
21

21

00:00:56.160  -->  00:00:59.160
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
