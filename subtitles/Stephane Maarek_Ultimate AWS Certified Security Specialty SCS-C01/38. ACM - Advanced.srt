1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,700
<v Instructor>So now let's do a deeper dive into ACM.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,700  -->  00:00:04,260
The first thing is that you can have
3

3

00:00:04,260  -->  00:00:07,860
a private certificate authority on ACM.
4

4

00:00:07,860  -->  00:00:11,790
So it allows you to actually issue certificates privately
5

5

00:00:11,790  -->  00:00:14,160
and you manage the certificate authority,
6

6

00:00:14,160  -->  00:00:17,580
including roots and subordinaries CAs.
7

7

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:22,580
So with this, you can deploy end-entity X.509 certificates.
8

8

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:24,570
What that means is that these certificates
9

9

00:00:24,570  -->  00:00:25,980
can be used by your application.
10

10

00:00:25,980  -->  00:00:28,140
They're end-entities that these certificates
11

11

00:00:28,140  -->  00:00:31,080
cannot be used to issue more certificates.
12

12

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:34,110
These certificates are trusted only by your organization,
13

13

00:00:34,110  -->  00:00:35,370
not the public internet,
14

14

00:00:35,370  -->  00:00:38,430
because it's a private certificate authority.
15

15

00:00:38,430  -->  00:00:42,030
It has deep integration with services such as Amazon EKS
16

16

00:00:42,030  -->  00:00:45,630
and really any service that is integrated with ACM.
17

17

00:00:45,630  -->  00:00:48,810
So you'll have CloudFront, API Gateway, ELB, ES,
18

18

00:00:48,810  -->  00:00:51,300
whatever you want, as long as, of course, the traffic
19

19

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:54,630
is private and within your own infrastructure.
20

20

00:00:54,630  -->  00:00:57,210
So these certificates can be issued for users
21

21

00:00:57,210  -->  00:00:58,080
for whatever they need.
22

22

00:00:58,080  -->  00:01:00,120
For example, for client VPN purposes.
23

23

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:01,860
They can be issued for computers.
24

24

00:01:01,860  -->  00:01:03,570
They can be issued for APIs
25

25

00:01:03,570  -->  00:01:07,740
that will expose a private URL, or IoT devices.
26

26

00:01:07,740  -->  00:01:11,070
So the use cases of using a private certificate authority
27

27

00:01:11,070  -->  00:01:13,440
is to do encrypted TLS communication
28

28

00:01:13,440  -->  00:01:17,130
from internally to cryptographically signed code
29

29

00:01:17,130  -->  00:01:19,410
to authenticate users, computers, API endpoints,
30

30

00:01:19,410  -->  00:01:21,060
and IoT devices.
31

31

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:23,430
And to also help enterprises
32

32

00:01:23,430  -->  00:01:26,523
build a public key infrastructure, or PKI.
33

33

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:28,463
Okay.
34

34

00:01:28,463  -->  00:01:30,330
Next, we have the validation techniques
35

35

00:01:30,330  -->  00:01:32,610
of certificates in ACM.
36

36

00:01:32,610  -->  00:01:34,950
So when you have a public certificate,
37

37

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:36,900
so we're back into the public realm now,
38

38

00:01:36,900  -->  00:01:39,840
you must prove that you own or control the domain
39

39

00:01:39,840  -->  00:01:43,470
because otherwise you cannot have a public certificate.
40

40

00:01:43,470  -->  00:01:45,660
So several ways of doing it.
41

41

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:48,870
The number one is to do DNS validation.
42

42

00:01:48,870  -->  00:01:51,180
And here, we're going to leverage a CNAME record
43

43

00:01:51,180  -->  00:01:53,280
that we create in our DNS config.
44

44

00:01:53,280  -->  00:01:56,520
It could be Route 53, it could be out there as well.
45

45

00:01:56,520  -->  00:01:57,390
And what's going to happen
46

46

00:01:57,390  -->  00:02:01,410
is that because you are able to insert this CNAME record,
47

47

00:02:01,410  -->  00:02:03,900
you are going to be issued a TLS certificate
48

48

00:02:03,900  -->  00:02:05,160
and you're good to go.
49

49

00:02:05,160  -->  00:02:06,510
So this is the preferred method
50

50

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:08,280
for automatic renewable purposes
51

51

00:02:08,280  -->  00:02:10,980
because everything is programmatic,
52

52

00:02:10,980  -->  00:02:13,350
and it only takes a few minutes to verify.
53

53

00:02:13,350  -->  00:02:14,183
So how does that work?
54

54

00:02:14,183  -->  00:02:16,530
The admin creates a CNAME record in your DNS,
55

55

00:02:16,530  -->  00:02:18,315
for example, Route 53.
56

56

00:02:18,315  -->  00:02:21,360
And ACM tells the admin what record to create.
57

57

00:02:21,360  -->  00:02:23,010
And then it looks like something like this
58

58

00:02:23,010  -->  00:02:25,530
with some big name and big value.
59

59

00:02:25,530  -->  00:02:28,230
And then the ACM will say, hey
60

60

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:30,570
I can verify that indeed you own this domain
61

61

00:02:30,570  -->  00:02:33,870
so I can issue this certificate for you.
62

62

00:02:33,870  -->  00:02:35,280
So it goes into pending validation
63

63

00:02:35,280  -->  00:02:38,490
and the record is validated and we're good to go.
64

64

00:02:38,490  -->  00:02:41,400
So the other way to do it is email validation.
65

65

00:02:41,400  -->  00:02:45,570
So the email validation will be sent to contact addresses
66

66

00:02:45,570  -->  00:02:49,440
in the who is database of your domain.
67

67

00:02:49,440  -->  00:02:50,460
So when you register domain,
68

68

00:02:50,460  -->  00:02:52,950
you have to register an email address,
69

69

00:02:52,950  -->  00:02:55,350
and that's what ACM will send an email to
70

70

00:02:55,350  -->  00:02:57,690
to make sure that, again, the owner of the domain
71

71

00:02:57,690  -->  00:03:02,690
as per the registrar is there, and accept the certificates.
72

72

00:03:03,720  -->  00:03:06,660
So it takes a few minutes to verify this certificate.
73

73

00:03:06,660  -->  00:03:09,330
Again, you just receive an email and you're good to go.
74

74

00:03:09,330  -->  00:03:12,780
This is only relevant for public certificates.
75

75

00:03:12,780  -->  00:03:14,820
In case you have a private certificate,
76

76

00:03:14,820  -->  00:03:16,260
you don't need to verify anything
77

77

00:03:16,260  -->  00:03:20,130
because you own the private certificate authority.
78

78

00:03:20,130  -->  00:03:22,650
So in the case of automatic renewal, how does that work?
79

79

00:03:22,650  -->  00:03:24,090
Well, if there's a failure
80

80

00:03:24,090  -->  00:03:26,880
to renew a DNS validated certificate,
81

81

00:03:26,880  -->  00:03:29,580
it could be because of inaccurate CNAME records
82

82

00:03:29,580  -->  00:03:31,170
in your DNS config,
83

83

00:03:31,170  -->  00:03:35,250
and you can try an alternative way such as email validation.
84

84

00:03:35,250  -->  00:03:37,200
But again, that requires a manual step
85

85

00:03:37,200  -->  00:03:39,660
from a human from the domain owner.
86

86

00:03:39,660  -->  00:03:43,830
ACM will send renewal notices 45 days before expiration,
87

87

00:03:43,830  -->  00:03:46,890
which is ample time for you to perform the renewal.
88

88

00:03:46,890  -->  00:03:49,080
And in case you receive emails, again,
89

89

00:03:49,080  -->  00:03:52,320
to the domains who is mailbox addresses that will be sent.
90

90

00:03:52,320  -->  00:03:53,880
Then the email contains a link,
91

91

00:03:53,880  -->  00:03:56,130
you click on it and you can do a renewal.
92

92

00:03:56,130  -->  00:03:59,430
The ACM will issue a renewed certificate
93

93

00:03:59,430  -->  00:04:01,230
but it will keep the same ARN
94

94

00:04:01,230  -->  00:04:04,920
to keep everything running smoothly within AWS.
95

95

00:04:04,920  -->  00:04:08,130
So again, upon expiration, we'll receive a renewal email,
96

96

00:04:08,130  -->  00:04:09,660
and then we'll click the validation link,
97

97

00:04:09,660  -->  00:04:10,560
and we're good to go.
98

98

00:04:10,560  -->  00:04:14,430
This is when we fail the DNS validation, of course.
99

99

00:04:14,430  -->  00:04:18,690
Now, how do you resolve a pending validation certificate
100

100

00:04:18,690  -->  00:04:19,710
in ACM?
101

101

00:04:19,710  -->  00:04:22,650
So again, confirm the CNAME in your DNS config.
102

102

00:04:22,650  -->  00:04:24,870
So you can use the dig command, for example,
103

103

00:04:24,870  -->  00:04:28,050
to verify the value of the DNS config itself.
104

104

00:04:28,050  -->  00:04:30,090
And then make sure you have the proper value,
105

105

00:04:30,090  -->  00:04:32,190
no additional or missing characters.
106

106

00:04:32,190  -->  00:04:35,580
And then if your DNS provider automatically modifies
107

107

00:04:35,580  -->  00:04:38,370
your DNS records by adding the bare domain to the end,
108

108

00:04:38,370  -->  00:04:40,470
make sure to remove the bare domain from it.
109

109

00:04:40,470  -->  00:04:43,650
So sometimes you'll have .example.com.example.com.
110

110

00:04:43,650  -->  00:04:44,730
That's common.
111

111

00:04:44,730  -->  00:04:48,390
And then if there is a CNAME and the TXT record
112

112

00:04:48,390  -->  00:04:50,100
that have the same domain name,
113

113

00:04:50,100  -->  00:04:53,520
then it may be a conflict for ACM, so test it out.
114

114

00:04:53,520  -->  00:04:57,120
And if you do have both a CNAME and the TXT record,
115

115

00:04:57,120  -->  00:04:59,253
then delete the TXT record.
116

116

00:05:00,180  -->  00:05:03,420
So instead of getting ACMs to issue certificates for you,
117

117

00:05:03,420  -->  00:05:06,240
you may want to actually manually create them.
118

118

00:05:06,240  -->  00:05:07,530
So there's a process for that.
119

119

00:05:07,530  -->  00:05:09,630
You can create a certificate manually.
120

120

00:05:09,630  -->  00:05:13,890
And then you upload the certificates either to ACM or IAM.
121

121

00:05:13,890  -->  00:05:15,360
So you will use local tools
122

122

00:05:15,360  -->  00:05:18,480
to actually generate a certificate signing request.
123

123

00:05:18,480  -->  00:05:21,360
You will submit this certificate signing request file
124

124

00:05:21,360  -->  00:05:23,940
to an external certificate authority
125

125

00:05:23,940  -->  00:05:25,530
that will validate, again, the ownership
126

126

00:05:25,530  -->  00:05:27,090
and issue a certificate for you.
127

127

00:05:27,090  -->  00:05:29,970
They will have their own methodology, but that is not ACM,
128

128

00:05:29,970  -->  00:05:32,760
because you wanna do this externally from ACM.
129

129

00:05:32,760  -->  00:05:34,590
You get back a certificate
130

130

00:05:34,590  -->  00:05:38,550
and you can upload the certificate into ACM or IAM.
131

131

00:05:38,550  -->  00:05:41,250
So there could be reasons why you would wanna do this
132

132

00:05:41,250  -->  00:05:44,040
but it's much easier if done everything within ACM,
133

133

00:05:44,040  -->  00:05:45,750
but still you have the capability
134

134

00:05:45,750  -->  00:05:48,570
of importing certificates in there.
135

135

00:05:48,570  -->  00:05:52,560
So how do we monitor for expired imported certificates?
136

136

00:05:52,560  -->  00:05:56,250
So we'll have a daily expiration event 45 days
137

137

00:05:56,250  -->  00:05:57,690
prior to expiration.
138

138

00:05:57,690  -->  00:06:00,300
And, of course, because they are imported certificates,
139

139

00:06:00,300  -->  00:06:02,190
we cannot automatically renew them
140

140

00:06:02,190  -->  00:06:04,230
because they've been signed elsewhere.
141

141

00:06:04,230  -->  00:06:05,940
So the number of days can be configured.
142

142

00:06:05,940  -->  00:06:08,370
The events will be appearing in EventBridge.
143

143

00:06:08,370  -->  00:06:12,720
And then you can have Lambda functions, SNS notifications,
144

144

00:06:12,720  -->  00:06:15,390
SQS messages, whatever you want for your integration.
145

145

00:06:15,390  -->  00:06:18,510
Or you can have also a rule in config
146

146

00:06:18,510  -->  00:06:21,570
called the ACM certificate exploration check
147

147

00:06:21,570  -->  00:06:25,020
to check regularly for the expiring certificates.
148

148

00:06:25,020  -->  00:06:27,870
And you can also send the non-compliance events
149

149

00:06:27,870  -->  00:06:29,070
into EventBridge.
150

150

00:06:29,070  -->  00:06:30,600
So two ways of doing it.
151

151

00:06:30,600  -->  00:06:33,180
But if you do have a manually imported certificate,
152

152

00:06:33,180  -->  00:06:35,910
you will have to manually renew it outside
153

153

00:06:35,910  -->  00:06:37,440
and then the re-import it.
154

154

00:06:37,440  -->  00:06:38,730
All right, that's it for this lecture.
155

155

00:06:38,730  -->  00:06:41,730
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
