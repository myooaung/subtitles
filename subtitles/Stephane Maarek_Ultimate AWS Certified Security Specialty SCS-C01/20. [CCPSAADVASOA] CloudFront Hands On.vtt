00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:02.310
<v Instructor>So let's go and practice using CloudFront,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.310  -->  00:00:04.890
but first we have to create an S3 bucket
3

3

00:00:04.890  -->  00:00:07.590
to hold our files for our distribution.
4

4

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:08.610
So let's create a bucket,
5

5

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:12.943
and I'll call this one demo-cloudfront-stephane-v4.
6

6

00:00:14.059  -->  00:00:15.510
And then we'll scroll down,
7

7

00:00:15.510  -->  00:00:17.400
leave everything as the default,
8

8

00:00:17.400  -->  00:00:19.173
and click on Create bucket.
9

9

00:00:20.490  -->  00:00:22.260
Okay, so my bucket is now created,
10

10

00:00:22.260  -->  00:00:24.453
and I'm going to upload some files in it.
11

11

00:00:25.290  -->  00:00:28.140
So let me add files, and I will choose my three files,
12

12

00:00:28.140  -->  00:00:31.830
beach, coffee, and index.html.
13

13

00:00:31.830  -->  00:00:33.003
So let's upload them.
14

14

00:00:34.260  -->  00:00:35.460
And now they've been uploaded,
15

15

00:00:35.460  -->  00:00:37.890
so if I go in my bucket, we can see all of them.
16

16

00:00:37.890  -->  00:00:39.960
And as a reminder, if I go on index.html,
17

17

00:00:39.960  -->  00:00:41.700
I have two ways of open it.
18

18

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:44.130
The first one is to use the object URL,
19

19

00:00:44.130  -->  00:00:46.560
but if I try it, I get an access denied
20

20

00:00:46.560  -->  00:00:48.750
because my object is not public.
21

21

00:00:48.750  -->  00:00:51.210
And if I go and click on Open here,
22

22

00:00:51.210  -->  00:00:53.280
this generates a pre-signed...
23

23

00:00:53.280  -->  00:00:54.600
So let's allow popups.
24

24

00:00:54.600  -->  00:00:58.530
This generates a pre-signed URL from my S3 object,
25

25

00:00:58.530  -->  00:01:00.060
which allows me to access the object.
26

26

00:01:00.060  -->  00:01:01.470
So I see I love coffee and Hello world!
27

27

00:01:01.470  -->  00:01:03.030
But I still don't see the image,
28

28

00:01:03.030  -->  00:01:05.490
because the image itself is not public.
29

29

00:01:05.490  -->  00:01:08.400
So let's see how we can instead use CloudFront
30

30

00:01:08.400  -->  00:01:10.320
to make these files accessible
31

31

00:01:10.320  -->  00:01:12.003
without making them public.
32

32

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:15.783
So let's open up the CloudFront console.
33

33

00:01:17.730  -->  00:01:19.650
And as you can see, on the top right corner,
34

34

00:01:19.650  -->  00:01:21.270
it is a global service,
35

35

00:01:21.270  -->  00:01:24.360
because, well, CloudFront is a global distribution,
36

36

00:01:24.360  -->  00:01:26.040
so there's no region selection.
37

37

00:01:26.040  -->  00:01:28.020
We next have to choose an origin domain.
38

38

00:01:28.020  -->  00:01:30.540
So as you can see, I get my Amazon S3 buckets,
39

39

00:01:30.540  -->  00:01:32.370
or my Elastic Load Balancer, or whatever.
40

40

00:01:32.370  -->  00:01:34.050
So if I choose my bucket,
41

41

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:37.620
I could choose my demo CloudFront bucket, clicking on here.
42

42

00:01:37.620  -->  00:01:40.560
But here you can enter really any domain name you want,
43

43

00:01:40.560  -->  00:01:42.510
including custom HTTP origins,
44

44

00:01:42.510  -->  00:01:43.800
this is fine.
45

45

00:01:43.800  -->  00:01:45.120
So then the origin access,
46

46

00:01:45.120  -->  00:01:46.710
how do you access the identity?
47

47

00:01:46.710  -->  00:01:49.530
Well, because this is Amazon S3, we have multiple ways.
48

48

00:01:49.530  -->  00:01:50.460
We have public,
49

49

00:01:50.460  -->  00:01:52.860
which is that the bucket itself must be public,
50

50

00:01:52.860  -->  00:01:54.570
but this is not the case for us.
51

51

00:01:54.570  -->  00:01:57.480
Then we have Origin Access Control, which is OAC,
52

52

00:01:57.480  -->  00:01:59.640
that's the recommended way we'll be using it.
53

53

00:01:59.640  -->  00:02:01.050
And here this was OAI,
54

54

00:02:01.050  -->  00:02:02.670
it was the previous way of doing it.
55

55

00:02:02.670  -->  00:02:03.870
But now we're going to use the new way
56

56

00:02:03.870  -->  00:02:06.240
called OAC, Origin Access Control.
57

57

00:02:06.240  -->  00:02:08.730
So we need to create an Origin Access Control,
58

58

00:02:08.730  -->  00:02:12.360
so to do so, let's click on Create control setting,
59

59

00:02:12.360  -->  00:02:13.710
and it just gives us a name for it.
60

60

00:02:13.710  -->  00:02:14.910
So this is good.
61

61

00:02:14.910  -->  00:02:16.770
And let's click on Create.
62

62

00:02:16.770  -->  00:02:19.170
So now this has been created
63

63

00:02:19.170  -->  00:02:22.530
and we will have to update the S3 bucket policy,
64

64

00:02:22.530  -->  00:02:26.460
so that CloudFront can access our S3 bucket.
65

65

00:02:26.460  -->  00:02:28.230
Because if you go right now in here
66

66

00:02:28.230  -->  00:02:31.980
and look at our bucket itself under Permissions
67

67

00:02:31.980  -->  00:02:32.970
and scroll down,
68

68

00:02:32.970  -->  00:02:34.650
the bucket policy is currently empty
69

69

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:37.170
and so CloudFront will not be able to access it.
70

70

00:02:37.170  -->  00:02:38.790
So right now, we'll leave it as is.
71

71

00:02:38.790  -->  00:02:42.240
I'm going to scroll down and skip many different settings.
72

72

00:02:42.240  -->  00:02:45.870
But one you have to set is the default root object,
73

73

00:02:45.870  -->  00:02:47.730
which is that the default object
74

74

00:02:47.730  -->  00:02:49.980
is going to be for me index.hmtl.
75

75

00:02:51.400  -->  00:02:52.410
Okay, so everything looks good,
76

76

00:02:52.410  -->  00:02:54.033
let's create our distribution.
77

77

00:02:54.990  -->  00:02:58.230
And our distribution can take some time to be created.
78

78

00:02:58.230  -->  00:02:59.250
As you can see here,
79

79

00:02:59.250  -->  00:03:01.110
the S3 bucket policy needs to be updated.
80

80

00:03:01.110  -->  00:03:04.170
So I can click on Copy policy here,
81

81

00:03:04.170  -->  00:03:06.240
and there is a shortcut from here
82

82

00:03:06.240  -->  00:03:10.110
to go straight to your bucket policy settings page.
83

83

00:03:10.110  -->  00:03:11.730
So here we go, we have it.
84

84

00:03:11.730  -->  00:03:13.560
Now let's click on Edit,
85

85

00:03:13.560  -->  00:03:16.950
and we're going to paste the policy we just printed.
86

86

00:03:16.950  -->  00:03:20.790
And by the way, if you somehow lose access to this policy,
87

87

00:03:20.790  -->  00:03:22.440
you can go under Origins.
88

88

00:03:22.440  -->  00:03:23.640
Then in here in Origins,
89

89

00:03:23.640  -->  00:03:25.890
you click on Edit, you scroll down,
90

90

00:03:25.890  -->  00:03:28.140
and here you will find the policy statement
91

91

00:03:28.140  -->  00:03:31.140
to copy and paste here.
92

92

00:03:31.140  -->  00:03:33.600
So if we look at this bucket policy now,
93

93

00:03:33.600  -->  00:03:37.650
we allow the CloudFront service to do GetObject
94

94

00:03:37.650  -->  00:03:39.840
on any file in our bucket,
95

95

00:03:39.840  -->  00:03:42.120
as long as the CloudFront distribution,
96

96

00:03:42.120  -->  00:03:43.440
so this is the condition,
97

97

00:03:43.440  -->  00:03:44.460
is the one we created.
98

98

00:03:44.460  -->  00:03:46.320
So this basically allows our distribution
99

99

00:03:46.320  -->  00:03:48.150
to access our S3 bucket.
100

100

00:03:48.150  -->  00:03:48.983
This is good.
101

101

00:03:48.983  -->  00:03:50.190
This was generated by AWS,
102

102

00:03:50.190  -->  00:03:52.350
we don't do anything besides this.
103

103

00:03:52.350  -->  00:03:54.480
So the permissions are now correct.
104

104

00:03:54.480  -->  00:03:58.170
So back in CloudFront, let's cancel this
105

105

00:03:58.170  -->  00:03:59.820
and we go to our distribution,
106

106

00:03:59.820  -->  00:04:02.730
and we have to wait until it becomes deployed.
107

107

00:04:02.730  -->  00:04:04.350
My CloudFront distribution is now ready,
108

108

00:04:04.350  -->  00:04:06.630
so I'm going to copy the domain name, open a new tab,
109

109

00:04:06.630  -->  00:04:07.500
and as you can see now,
110

110

00:04:07.500  -->  00:04:09.750
I get I love coffee, Hello world!
111

111

00:04:09.750  -->  00:04:11.130
And my image.
112

112

00:04:11.130  -->  00:04:14.010
So you can go to /coffee.jpg,
113

113

00:04:14.010  -->  00:04:15.450
and of course, this will work.
114

114

00:04:15.450  -->  00:04:16.950
And you can go to /beach.jpg,
115

115

00:04:16.950  -->  00:04:18.780
and this will work as well.
116

116

00:04:18.780  -->  00:04:19.650
But the cool thing about it
117

117

00:04:19.650  -->  00:04:21.690
is that now if I refresh this page,
118

118

00:04:21.690  -->  00:04:24.120
this is served actually from the CloudFront cache,
119

119

00:04:24.120  -->  00:04:27.090
and not from the S3 bucket itself.
120

120

00:04:27.090  -->  00:04:29.310
Because well, I requested the file once,
121

121

00:04:29.310  -->  00:04:31.950
so now they are automatically sent by CloudFront.
122

122

00:04:31.950  -->  00:04:34.320
As you can see, the loading is much quicker.
123

123

00:04:34.320  -->  00:04:36.300
And again, if I go to index.html,
124

124

00:04:36.300  -->  00:04:38.100
this is served from the cache.
125

125

00:04:38.100  -->  00:04:39.630
So this is the beauty of CloudFront.
126

126

00:04:39.630  -->  00:04:40.800
Now we've done one request
127

127

00:04:40.800  -->  00:04:42.300
against Amazon S3 through CloudFront,
128

128

00:04:42.300  -->  00:04:45.390
and then the rest is cached on the distribution itself.
129

129

00:04:45.390  -->  00:04:47.580
So if I go back now to CloudFront,
130

130

00:04:47.580  -->  00:04:49.560
on the left-hand side, just to show you,
131

131

00:04:49.560  -->  00:04:51.540
you have the Origin access,
132

132

00:04:51.540  -->  00:04:54.420
and this is where you will find your Origin access controls
133

133

00:04:54.420  -->  00:04:56.970
and we can see that this one was created
134

134

00:04:56.970  -->  00:04:58.350
and is active right now,
135

135

00:04:58.350  -->  00:05:01.207
and is assigned to this distribution.
136

136

00:05:01.207  -->  00:05:02.610
So, okay, that's it,
137

137

00:05:02.610  -->  00:05:03.870
we've seen how CloudFront works.
138

138

00:05:03.870  -->  00:05:05.010
I hope you liked it,
139

139

00:05:05.010  -->  00:05:06.960
and I will see you in the next lecture.
