00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:01.710
<v Instructor>So let's talk about the instance</v>
2

2

00:00:01.710  -->  00:00:04.140
refresh feature of Auto Scaling.
3

3

00:00:04.140  -->  00:00:06.990
And the goal of this is to have a launch template.
4

4

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:09.150
You want to update it, and then you want to update
5

5

00:00:09.150  -->  00:00:11.520
all the underlying EC2 instances
6

6

00:00:11.520  -->  00:00:13.320
in your Auto Scaling group to match
7

7

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:15.180
this new launch template.
8

8

00:00:15.180  -->  00:00:16.770
Now, this feature doesn't come up on its own,
9

9

00:00:16.770  -->  00:00:19.470
but it comes up combined with other security concepts
10

10

00:00:19.470  -->  00:00:20.760
and that gives you the answer of the exam.
11

11

00:00:20.760  -->  00:00:22.710
So let's explain this concept first.
12

12

00:00:22.710  -->  00:00:24.360
So to do such a goal,
13

13

00:00:24.360  -->  00:00:26.640
we need to use the instance refresh feature.
14

14

00:00:26.640  -->  00:00:28.170
It's native to your Auto Scaling group.
15

15

00:00:28.170  -->  00:00:30.120
So let's say we have an ASG,
16

16

00:00:30.120  -->  00:00:33.420
and we have, in this example, nine EC2 instances.
17

17

00:00:33.420  -->  00:00:35.460
They're using the old launch templates,
18

18

00:00:35.460  -->  00:00:38.040
but we are updating the launch templates
19

19

00:00:38.040  -->  00:00:41.100
of our Auto Scaling group, which does nothing by default,
20

20

00:00:41.100  -->  00:00:44.220
but then we use the start instance refresh API.
21

21

00:00:44.220  -->  00:00:45.990
So we start an instance refresh.
22

22

00:00:45.990  -->  00:00:47.130
And what's going to happen is that
23

23

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:49.590
we set a minimum healthy percentage
24

24

00:00:49.590  -->  00:00:51.480
of how many instances we want in service.
25

25

00:00:51.480  -->  00:00:52.313
For example, we say,
26

26

00:00:52.313  -->  00:00:55.740
50% of minimum healthy percentage,
27

27

00:00:55.740  -->  00:00:58.440
which is going to take down a few EC2 instances,
28

28

00:00:58.440  -->  00:01:00.360
and over time, create new ones
29

29

00:01:00.360  -->  00:01:02.400
with the new launch templates.
30

30

00:01:02.400  -->  00:01:05.130
And this is how your group is going to be transitioned
31

31

00:01:05.130  -->  00:01:08.550
from the old launch template to the new launch templates.
32

32

00:01:08.550  -->  00:01:10.260
You can specify a warmup time,
33

33

00:01:10.260  -->  00:01:13.980
so how long until the instance is going to be ready to use.
34

34

00:01:13.980  -->  00:01:16.740
And after a while, you'll have a full
35

35

00:01:16.740  -->  00:01:19.470
Auto Scaling group that only has EC2 instances
36

36

00:01:19.470  -->  00:01:21.780
that are using the new launch templates.
37

37

00:01:21.780  -->  00:01:22.613
Okay?
38

38

00:01:22.613  -->  00:01:23.490
So that's it for this lecture.
39

39

00:01:23.490  -->  00:01:24.540
I hope you liked it,
40

40

00:01:24.540  -->  00:01:26.583
and I will see you in the next lecture.
