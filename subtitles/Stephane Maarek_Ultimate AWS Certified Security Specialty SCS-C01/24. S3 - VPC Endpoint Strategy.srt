00:00:00,237  -->  00:00:01,830
<v ->Hi, and welcome to this lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:01,830  -->  00:00:04,740
on VPC Endpoint Strategies for Amazon S3.
3

3

00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:07,020
So we know that we can access Amazon S3
4

4

00:00:07,020  -->  00:00:09,900
directly through a VPC Gateway Endpoint.
5

5

00:00:09,900  -->  00:00:11,940
So this doesn't have any costs
6

6

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:14,430
and it can only be accessed by resources
7

7

00:00:14,430  -->  00:00:17,550
within the VPC where it's created.
8

8

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:20,550
So we have VPC Gateway Endpoint for Amazon s3
9

9

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:22,860
and then we enable DNS support.
10

10

00:00:22,860  -->  00:00:25,890
We update the root tables and we keep on using
11

11

00:00:25,890  -->  00:00:28,200
the public DNS of Amazon S3.
12

12

00:00:28,200  -->  00:00:30,150
And what's going to happen is that the traffic
13

13

00:00:30,150  -->  00:00:33,270
is gonna go through this VPC gateway endpoints.
14

14

00:00:33,270  -->  00:00:35,670
We also need to make sure that the security group
15

15

00:00:35,670  -->  00:00:38,640
attached to the EC2 instance has Outbound rules
16

16

00:00:38,640  -->  00:00:42,120
that allows traffic that go directly into Amazon S3.
17

17

00:00:42,120  -->  00:00:45,720
So when we have all these things together, it's working.
18

18

00:00:45,720  -->  00:00:49,230
Just remember that Gateway Endpoints can only be accessed
19

19

00:00:49,230  -->  00:00:51,960
by resources within your VPC but not elsewhere,
20

20

00:00:51,960  -->  00:00:53,730
so Direct Connect does not work,
21

21

00:00:53,730  -->  00:00:55,680
side to side VPN does not work,
22

22

00:00:55,680  -->  00:00:57,600
and so on VPC peering does not work,
23

23

00:00:57,600  -->  00:00:59,850
only stuff within your VPC.
24

24

00:00:59,850  -->  00:01:03,840
Next we have the VPC Interface Endpoint for Amazon S3.
25

25

00:01:03,840  -->  00:01:05,580
So let's take an example of a VPC
26

26

00:01:05,580  -->  00:01:07,530
with several availability zones.
27

27

00:01:07,530  -->  00:01:10,080
We have DNS support enabled and DNS hostnames enabled.
28

28

00:01:10,080  -->  00:01:13,350
We have private subnets across these two AZs.
29

29

00:01:13,350  -->  00:01:16,170
So with the VPC interface endpoint we're going to get
30

30

00:01:16,170  -->  00:01:19,800
Elastic Network interfaces deployed in our subnets
31

31

00:01:19,800  -->  00:01:22,050
and then the security groups can be attached
32

32

00:01:22,050  -->  00:01:25,080
to these ENIs for network security.
33

33

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:26,340
So then what we're going to do
34

34

00:01:26,340  -->  00:01:28,830
is that we're going to have EC2 instances
35

35

00:01:28,830  -->  00:01:31,860
and with the appropriate network security
36

36

00:01:31,860  -->  00:01:34,620
we're gonna be able to access Amazon S3 privately
37

37

00:01:34,620  -->  00:01:37,020
through the VPC interface endpoints.
38

38

00:01:37,020  -->  00:01:39,660
The advantage of using an interface endpoint
39

39

00:01:39,660  -->  00:01:42,570
is that we can get access directly from on-premises
40

40

00:01:42,570  -->  00:01:45,720
through a site to site VPN or Direct Connect.
41

41

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:49,890
This costs about 1 cents per hour per AZ, so it's not free
42

42

00:01:49,890  -->  00:01:54,240
and it's works similarly, once you have enabled the DNS
43

43

00:01:54,240  -->  00:01:56,220
in your settings in your VPC,
44

44

00:01:56,220  -->  00:01:59,220
then any public DNS of Amazon S3
45

45

00:01:59,220  -->  00:02:01,500
will be resolved to the private interface endpoint
46

46

00:02:01,500  -->  00:02:02,850
and you'll be good.
47

47

00:02:02,850  -->  00:02:04,920
Okay, finally, you need to know
48

48

00:02:04,920  -->  00:02:06,960
there's like something called private DNS name,
49

49

00:02:06,960  -->  00:02:09,090
which works for most VPC endpoints,
50

50

00:02:09,090  -->  00:02:12,090
but for the VPC interface endpoint for Amazon S3
51

51

00:02:12,090  -->  00:02:14,040
there is no such thing as private DNS name.
52

52

00:02:14,040  -->  00:02:16,800
The only thing you can use is the public DNS name
53

53

00:02:16,800  -->  00:02:19,290
of Amazon s3, but the traffic will still resolve
54

54

00:02:19,290  -->  00:02:23,010
to the VPC interface endpoint within your VPC.
55

55

00:02:23,010  -->  00:02:24,840
So if we try to summarize what we have
56

56

00:02:24,840  -->  00:02:28,650
in a single VPC architecture, we may have EC2 instances
57

57

00:02:28,650  -->  00:02:30,330
accessing directly Amazon S3
58

58

00:02:30,330  -->  00:02:32,610
for a gateway endpoint for free.
59

59

00:02:32,610  -->  00:02:34,950
Or if you choose to create an interface endpoint
60

60

00:02:34,950  -->  00:02:37,530
we have a private link into Amazon S3
61

61

00:02:37,530  -->  00:02:38,970
and the use case would be to use
62

62

00:02:38,970  -->  00:02:42,000
either direct connect or site to site VPN
63

63

00:02:42,000  -->  00:02:46,050
to connect to Amazon S3 through this interface endpoint.
64

64

00:02:46,050  -->  00:02:48,690
If you have a multi VPC centralized architecture
65

65

00:02:48,690  -->  00:02:50,160
where you want all your network traffic
66

66

00:02:50,160  -->  00:02:52,140
to go through one Central VPC,
67

67

00:02:52,140  -->  00:02:55,530
then an architecture you can have is EC2 instances
68

68

00:02:55,530  -->  00:02:58,680
that connect through Gateway Endpoint to Amazon S3
69

69

00:02:58,680  -->  00:03:00,840
in their respective VPC because that's free
70

70

00:03:00,840  -->  00:03:01,800
and you can do it.
71

71

00:03:01,800  -->  00:03:04,410
And then interface endpoints can be very helpful.
72

72

00:03:04,410  -->  00:03:07,110
For example, if you wanted to centralize traffic
73

73

00:03:07,110  -->  00:03:08,250
through this central VPC,
74

74

00:03:08,250  -->  00:03:10,170
so instead of going through Gateway Endpoint,
75

75

00:03:10,170  -->  00:03:12,210
you could go through a transit gateway
76

76

00:03:12,210  -->  00:03:14,070
into the interface endpoint.
77

77

00:03:14,070  -->  00:03:17,280
And this works as well for the on-premises traffic
78

78

00:03:17,280  -->  00:03:20,430
such as Direct Connect and site to side VPN.
79

79

00:03:20,430  -->  00:03:23,130
So at the exam, you will have indicators
80

80

00:03:23,130  -->  00:03:25,740
whether or not you should use Gateway or interface
81

81

00:03:25,740  -->  00:03:28,080
and it's up to you to choose the right one of course
82

82

00:03:28,080  -->  00:03:30,210
but you have enough information now
83

83

00:03:30,210  -->  00:03:32,880
to really understand the differences.
84

84

00:03:32,880  -->  00:03:35,550
Also, we have VPC endpoint restrictions.
85

85

00:03:35,550  -->  00:03:36,813
So we have a couple ones.
86

86

00:03:36,813  -->  00:03:40,080
We have SourceVPC, and SourceVPCE.
87

87

00:03:40,080  -->  00:03:44,370
So here with SourceVPC we can restrict access
88

88

00:03:44,370  -->  00:03:46,230
to a specific VPC.
89

89

00:03:46,230  -->  00:03:49,800
For example, in here I restrict access to my bucket
90

90

00:03:49,800  -->  00:03:53,550
if it doesn't come through a specified source VPC.
91

91

00:03:53,550  -->  00:03:56,970
Now this condition can only work if you have a VPC endpoint.
92

92

00:03:56,970  -->  00:03:59,310
So that means that on top of going through the VPC endpoint
93

93

00:03:59,310  -->  00:04:01,860
you can restrict the VPC it's coming from.
94

94

00:04:01,860  -->  00:04:05,433
If you wanted to restrict access to specific VPC endpoints
95

95

00:04:05,433  -->  00:04:08,970
what you can do is have a source VPCE condition,
96

96

00:04:08,970  -->  00:04:13,560
E for endpoints, and then you specify the VPC endpoints ID.
97

97

00:04:13,560  -->  00:04:15,120
Once you have this as well
98

98

00:04:15,120  -->  00:04:17,640
so you can restrict by SourceIP.
99

99

00:04:17,640  -->  00:04:20,970
Just remember, the AWS SourceIP condition
100

100

00:04:20,970  -->  00:04:23,130
is for public IP addresses,
101

101

00:04:23,130  -->  00:04:27,210
whereas the VPC SourceIP is for private IP addresses
102

102

00:04:27,210  -->  00:04:30,870
and it is only valid when you start using VPC endpoints.
103

103

00:04:30,870  -->  00:04:32,070
Okay, so that's it for this lecture.
104

104

00:04:32,070  -->  00:04:33,030
I hope you liked it,
105

105

00:04:33,030  -->  00:04:34,980
and I will see you in the next lecture.
