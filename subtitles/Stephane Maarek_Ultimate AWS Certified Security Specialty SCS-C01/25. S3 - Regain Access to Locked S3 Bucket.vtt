00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:02.280
<v Instructor>So there is a chance you may get locked out</v>
2

2

00:00:02.280  -->  00:00:03.420
of your S3 bucket.
3

3

00:00:03.420  -->  00:00:04.380
How does that work?
4

4

00:00:04.380  -->  00:00:06.900
Well say you define an S3 bucket policy
5

5

00:00:06.900  -->  00:00:08.340
and you deny access to everyone.
6

6

00:00:08.340  -->  00:00:11.130
So Deny s3*, Principal*.
7

7

00:00:11.130  -->  00:00:13.680
Literally, once you attach this bucket policy,
8

8

00:00:13.680  -->  00:00:14.790
you cannot do anything.
9

9

00:00:14.790  -->  00:00:16.500
Users cannot access your data,
10

10

00:00:16.500  -->  00:00:18.450
you cannot even change the bucket policy
11

11

00:00:18.450  -->  00:00:22.110
because while that is an API call on top of your S bracket.
12

12

00:00:22.110  -->  00:00:24.690
So what do you do to solve this problem?
13

13

00:00:24.690  -->  00:00:28.080
Well, what you need to do is to delete the S3 bucket policy.
14

14

00:00:28.080  -->  00:00:30.900
But the only thing that doesn't get denied in your account
15

15

00:00:30.900  -->  00:00:32.460
when everything else is being denied,
16

16

00:00:32.460  -->  00:00:35.070
is your AWS accounts root user,
17

17

00:00:35.070  -->  00:00:37.650
because deny statement is to not apply
18

18

00:00:37.650  -->  00:00:40.170
to the root user, so therefore using the root user,
19

19

00:00:40.170  -->  00:00:43.800
you can go ahead, safely delete the bucket policy,
20

20

00:00:43.800  -->  00:00:46.680
and create a new one that doesn't lock you out.
21

21

00:00:46.680  -->  00:00:48.330
Okay? So just a short lecture.
22

22

00:00:48.330  -->  00:00:50.370
It should make sense but worth saying
23

23

00:00:50.370  -->  00:00:52.980
in that may get you one point at the exam.
24

24

00:00:52.980  -->  00:00:53.813
All right, that's it.
25

25

00:00:53.813  -->  00:00:56.620
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
