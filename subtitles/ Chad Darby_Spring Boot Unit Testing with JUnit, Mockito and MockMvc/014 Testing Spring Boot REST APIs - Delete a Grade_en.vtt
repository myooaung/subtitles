00:00:00.951 --> 00:00:02.330
In this video we'll cover the test

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.633
for deleting grades.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.280
And what we'll do is we'll send over a delete request

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.083
over to grade/id/gradeType.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.263
All righty, let's swing into our ID and let's get started.

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.663
I'll zoom in here and I'll start writing this test.

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.530
And this is the test here for deleting a grade.

8
00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:44.670
And the first thing I want to do

9
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.750
is verify that the grade exist before I delete it.

10
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.063
So I make use of mathGradeDao.findById of 1.

11
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.953
And I'll assert that this given math grade is present.

12
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.780
Now I'll attempt to delete the grade by using my MockMvc

13
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.723
and performing a delete request.

14
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.500
This will be for grades/id/gradeType.

15
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:24.151
And this will be for ID of 1 and grade type of math.

16
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.860
And I'll expect that this is successful.

17
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.043
So everything is okay.

18
00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:35.731
And also, just check the content type.

19
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.510
And then also, I can check the contents

20
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.410
of the JSON response here.

21
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.963
So I can check the ID, first name, et cetera.

22
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.060
In particular here, we want to check the grades here.

23
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.100
We initially had one math grade,

24
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.180
but the test just deleted the math grade.

25
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.030
So we want to verify that we have zero math grades here.

26
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.053
So checking the array size and making sure it's zero.

27
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.840
All righty, so this coding looks pretty good.

28
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.390
Let's go ahead and test it out.

29
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.910
And we see green, green, green.

30
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.743
So this is excellent.

31
00:03:10.743 --> 00:03:11.660
So our test passed

32
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.620
and we're able to cover the case here of deleting a grade.

33
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.453
Good job.
