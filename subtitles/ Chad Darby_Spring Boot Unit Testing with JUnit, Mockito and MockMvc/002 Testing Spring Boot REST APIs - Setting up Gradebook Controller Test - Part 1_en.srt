1
00:00:01,064 --> 00:00:01,897
In this video,

2
00:00:01,897 --> 00:00:03,870
will get started with testing REST APIs

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,763
for the Spring REST controllers.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,640
Now, here's the problem.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,840
How can we test REST APIs developed

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,980
with Spring RESTs Controllers?

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,550
Also, how can we create HTTP requests

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,170
and send them to the Spring REST Controllers?

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,760
And how can we verify the HTTP response?

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,230
For the response, I'd like to check the status code.

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,950
I'd like to check the content type.

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,210
And also, inspect the JSON response body.

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,000
So I'm at a loss here.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,163
How can I achieve that?

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,360
Well, Spring provides testing support,

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,420
so we can test Spring RESTs controllers using MockMVC.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,410
And we saw MockMVC in some of the earlier videos.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,310
This provide Spring REST processing

19
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,000
of requests and response.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,290
And the nice thing here is that

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,420
there's no need to run a server, embedded or external.

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,290
We're mocking everything out.

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,120
In general, the process is very similar

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,040
to Spring MVC testing.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,680
There's simply some slight differences

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,349
for checking the content type,

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,410
and also checking the JSON results.

28
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,260
But don't worry,

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,560
we'll cover those differences in these videos.

30
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,600
Let's take a look at the preliminary setup.

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,500
For our GradebookControllerTest,

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,450
we need to stub out the test class,

33
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,810
and we also needs to define the fields that we'll use later.

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,180
Like the MockMVC, the Service, the DAOs, et cetera.

35
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,660
And also, we need to add some setup and cleanup code,

36
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,350
so that's using the @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach.

37
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,160
And we used a lot of these development techniques

38
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,370
in some of the previous videos,

39
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,730
and we'll simply apply the same approaches here

40
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,283
for the REST API testing videos.

41
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,490
And now, here's an overview

42
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,160
of what our GradebookControllerTest will look like.

43
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,550
Up top, we'll have the annotations

44
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,140
for the test property source.

45
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,270
We'll auto configure, the MockMVC,

46
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,270
and we'll make use of the SpringBootTest annotation.

47
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,410
We'll have our test class, and then we'll go through it,

48
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,030
and we'll actually inject the supporting utils like MockMVC.

49
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,180
We'll inject the Service and the DAOs.

50
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,000
We'll inject our SQL strings.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,830
And also, we'll set up the annotations here

52
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,180
for the setup and cleanup code

53
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,790
using the @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach.

54
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,980
So that's the big picture,

55
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,813
and then we'll go through,

56
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:17,140
and actually write the appropriate coding for this.

57
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,560
All righty, this looks really good.

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,700
I'm getting excited.

59
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,813
Let's go ahead and swing into our IDE and let's get started.

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,370
I'll zoom in here, and I'll just collapse

61
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,053
some of the packages.

62
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,130
And I'll move down to my test section.

63
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,773
And I will add a new test class.

64
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,243
And the name of this class is GradebookControllerTest.

65
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:08,307
Let me expand my window here for a second,

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,390
and I'll start off here with my annotations

67
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,010
for test property source.

68
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,623
I'll reference my application-test.properties.

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,803
I'll auto configure the MockMVC.

70
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,890
I'll also set up the SpringBootTest annotation.

71
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,590
And one of the item that I'll add here

72
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,270
is the transactional annotation

73
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,950
because we'll make use of the JPA Entity Manager,

74
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,930
directly in this test,

75
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,223
and so we need to have this annotation, in place for that.

76
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,720
I'll go ahead and set up some of my test items here.

77
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,563
We'll make use of a mock servlet request.

78
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,410
I'll also inject the JPA Entity Manager,

79
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,660
like I mentioned earlier.

80
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,623
So we inject that using the PersistenceContext.

81
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,431
I'll set up a mock here for my StudentAndGradeService.

82
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,170
So there's some scenarios

83
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,263
where I'll make use of this mock in our test.

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,410
Let me stretch out here at the bottom a bit,

85
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,210
I'll give myself some room to work with.

86
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,090
And now in this next section, what we're going to do is that

87
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,020
we'll actually leverage some code that we've written before.

88
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,840
In our StudentAndGradeServiceTest,

89
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,950
there's a lot of good code over there,

90
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,650
and we'll simply copy some of that code,

91
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,670
and we'll move it into our GradebookControllerTest.

92
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,880
Again, we wrote a lot of this code

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,510
in the previous set of videos,

94
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,490
and so you've seen this code before.

95
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,060
We're simply going to leverage this code,

96
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,330
and use it here in our GradebookControllerTest.

97
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,410
So we'll do a little copy paste exercise

98
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,890
in the next section here.

99
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,453
So follow along with me.

100
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,055
And what I'll do is

101
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:33,833
I'll open up my StudentAndGradeServiceTest.

102
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,500
And the first thing I want to do

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,674
is I want to grab the JdbcTemplate, the DAOs,

104
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:54,070
and the services.

105
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,660
So let's just kind highlight the code here,

106
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,910
starting at JdbcTemplate,

107
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,283
all the way down to the student service.

108
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,620
And we'll just go ahead and copy these lines.

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,550
So this is in our StudentAndGradeServiceTest.

110
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,893
Let's copy this code,

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,640
and then we'll move over to our GradebookControllerTest,

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,023
and then we'll paste in that code.

113
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,440
Alrighty. So that looks pretty good.

114
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,823
Now, let's move back to our StudentAndGradeServiceTest,

115
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,070
and let's go ahead and grab all of those SQL scripts

116
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,640
that we injected.

117
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,120
So I'll start here with the SQL for add student,

118
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,850
all the way down to delete history grades.

119
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,260
So all of this code here that we have highlighted,

120
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,340
let's go ahead and copy that.

121
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,610
And this is from the StudentAndGradeServiceTest.

122
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,990
Let's copy this code and then move back over

123
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,003
to our GradebookControllerTest, and paste that code.

124
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,830
So we're in GradebookControllerTest,

125
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,530
now let's go ahead and do a paste.

126
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,043
Okay, great.

127
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,030
Now, let's swing back over

128
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,663
to our StudentAndGradeServiceTest.

129
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,953
And let's grab this setup code here for @BeforeEach.

130
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,870
So let's go ahead and copy this

131
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,230
from StudentAndGradeServiceTest,

132
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,350
and then we'll move over to GradebookControllerTest

133
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,313
and paste it in.

134
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,440
Excellent. That looks pretty good.

135
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:54,200
And then, one last thing, in StudentAndGradeServiceTest,

136
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,700
we're almost done, all the way down there at the bottom,

137
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,390
let's grab that cleanup code that we had, the @AfterEach.

138
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,560
Let's copy this from StudentAndGradeServiceTest,

139
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,270
and let's swing over to GradebookControllerTest,

140
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,143
and paste it.

141
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,040
Okay, looks good.

142
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,520
And again, this is all the code

143
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,890
that we wrote in the previous videos.

144
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,150
So there's nothing really new here.

145
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,053
We're just simply reusing code that we created earlier.

146
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,990
And now, one thing I'd like to do

147
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,800
is just set up a little placeholder test

148
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,299
that just does nothing.

149
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,200
I just want to make sure I can run this test class.

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,750
So just a very basic placeholder test does nothing here.

151
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,190
And we simply need Test annotation in place.

152
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,220
And now, let's go ahead and run this placeholder test.

153
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,053
And I just want to make sure

154
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:49,430
that we have all the infrastructure,

155
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,483
all the mechanics in place here, for this example.

156
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,513
And excellent.

157
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:55,346
So this test runs,

158
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,340
that means that we can do all the injection,

159
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,930
all the properties and so forth, that all works.

160
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,520
And we can actually get down and start writing

161
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,580
some real tests later.

162
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,250
But I just wanted to have a little litmus test here,

163
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,260
to make sure that our infrastructure is set up properly,

164
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,093
and it is.

165
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:09,926
So this is great.

166
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:10,759
I'm happy.
