00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.123
All righty.

2
00:00:02.123 --> 00:00:03.950
So we're making some good progress here.

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.900
In this video we'll cover assertEquals()

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.767
and assertNotEquals().

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.113
Let's go ahead and add a new test.

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.020
And this test is for

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.653
adding the grade results for student grades.

8
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:48.660
I'll make use of assertEquals().

9
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.310
I'll give the expected value

10
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.010
and then for student grades,

11
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.940
I'll add the grade results for a single class

12
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.220
and I'll get the MathGradeResults.

13
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.980
And if everything works out right

14
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.843
it should equal 353.25.

15
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.210
I run a test and it passes just fine.

16
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.043
It's green.

17
00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:22.876
Awesome.

18
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.130
Now let's go ahead and add another test.

19
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.660
And for this test

20
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.943
we'll add the grade results for student grades, not equal.

21
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:01.501
I'll add the assertNotEquals().

22
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.563
The expected, I'll just give a bad value here, zero.

23
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.293
And then similar coding like we had before.

24
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.070
Now let's run this test

25
00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:29.040
and this test passes as desired.

26
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.950
I'll go up here and break one of the tests.

27
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.170
I'll change the expected value

28
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.113
just to see that the test fails.

29
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.100
We see the results there.

30
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.510
We broke it on purpose.

31
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.310
Go ahead and change the values back.

32
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.053
And then everything's A-okay.
