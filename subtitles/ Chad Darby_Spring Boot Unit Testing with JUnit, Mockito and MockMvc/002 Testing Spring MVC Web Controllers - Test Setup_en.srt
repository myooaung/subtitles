1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,550
Okay, so let's go ahead and move into our IDE.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,513
And what I'd like to do is create a new test class.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,270
So I'll move down into my test section into this package,

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,810
com.luv2code.springmvc

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,170
and I'll create a new class

6
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:23,690
and the name for this class.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,603
I'll call it GradebookControllerTest.

8
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:39,357
All right, here's my class.

9
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:41,253
Let me expand my window for a second.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,960
The first thing I like to do is set

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,973
up the test property source, application.properties.

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,130
I'll also Auto configure the MockMvc

13
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,725
and make sure you choose the correct annotation here.

14
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,883
AutoconfigureMockMvc.

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,650
And then we simply make use

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,463
of the spring boot test annotation.

17
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,423
Let's go ahead

18
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:14,900
and inject some supporting fields here.

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,370
We'll use these later in our examples

20
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,090
but I'll just go ahead and get things set up.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,053
So I'll make use of the jdbc template.

22
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,687
We'll also inject the MockMvc

23
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,761
and then I'll also set up

24
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,893
a mock for my student and grade service.

25
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,230
And again these are simply some supporting fields

26
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,603
that we'll use in some of the following tests.

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,690
Let me just stretch out a bit

28
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,453
get myself some room to work with.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,290
I'll make use of a before each annotation here

30
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,623
to kind of do some initial setup for my test.

31
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:09,530
And I'll actually just copy some

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,130
of the code from our student and grade service test.

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,590
Let me open that one up and I'll just kind of

34
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,650
copy the same thing I had before just adding a new student

35
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,380
to the database for each one of the tests.

36
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,960
I'll just copy this move over here

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,740
to my GreatbookControllerTest and paste it in

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,850
and I'll do a similar thing for the after each

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,170
let's move over to our student in grade service test

40
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,270
and let's just copy that and move it over.

41
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,103
Okay, excellent.

42
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,500
So we have our basics in place here

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,870
and this some good infrastructure that we have in place.

44
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,850
And we'll use this in some of the following videos

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,400
but at the moment, this looks pretty good.

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,233
I like it.
