00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.800
Okay, let's go ahead and move in here.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.930
And so in this first section,

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.950
we're going to modify our CollegeStudent class

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.883
and we're going to add a new private field for id.

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.239
All right, we're in our CollegeStudent class

6
00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.943
and we'll add that new private field for id.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.800
I'll generate the Getters and Setters here

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.953
for this given field.

9
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.933
Excellent.

10
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.810
Let me stretch out here at the bottom,

11
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.673
give myself some room to work with.

12
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.000
And I'll also add a private method

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.433
that'll simply return the first name and the ID.

14
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.260
And we'll actually use these new items here,

15
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.440
so we'll actually write some test

16
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.360
to access the private field directly.

17
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.940
And we'll also write some test

18
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.753
to access this private method.

19
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.150
Let's go ahead and move into our test section here

20
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.993
and let's add a new test.

21
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.350
And the name for this new class,

22
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.250
we'll call it ReflectionTestUtilsTest.

23
00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:02.730
Okay, great. Here's the basic shelve for the class.

24
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.260
And we'll go ahead and start adding some code

25
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.093
into this class.
