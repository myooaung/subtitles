00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.023
In this video,

2
00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:03.690
we're going to update our Thymeleaf template

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.393
for student information.

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.860
Here's our work that we have to do.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.670
Currently, the UI for student information

6
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.830
has hard-coded data and ugh, that's bad.

7
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.510
And what we'd like to do is update the Thymeleaf template

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.090
for student information to use dynamic data.

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.530
We have our Thymeleaf template here

10
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.520
in the bottom left studentinformation.html, hard-coded data.

11
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.930
And now we want to have the Thymeleaf template use the data

12
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.000
that's being populated by the controller

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.800
that's pulling in the data from the service,

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.793
the DAOs and the database.

15
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.540
And this will give us the dynamic data

16
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.940
for math assignments, science assignments

17
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.950
and history assignments.

18
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.380
All righty, this looks really good.

19
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.730
Let's go ahead and dive in.

20
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.980
Let's get started by opening up our studentinformation.html

21
00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:03.980
and we'll follow the standard drill right?

22
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.950
We'll have some hard-coded information in here.

23
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.820
We'll remove that hard-coded data

24
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.680
and we'll make use of the dynamic data.

25
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.410
And just like before we'll have that dynamic data,

26
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.930
as far as coding examples commented out already

27
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960
and we'll simply uncomment that code

28
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.210
and use it appropriately.

29
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.280
So we're kind of helping you out here

30
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.780
with some of this development.

31
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.433
All righty, so let's go ahead

32
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.200
and move down to this one section here

33
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.870
for student information.

34
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.610
Right now we have the student, Eric Roby hard-coded,

35
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.973
let's go ahead and delete this hard-coded data.

36
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.270
And we'll uncomment the section here for the dynamic data.

37
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.913
So we'll use student.fullName.

38
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.900
And now let's move down a little bit further here

39
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.040
for math assignments.

40
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.160
We'll delete the hard-coded data of 100

41
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.830
and then we'll uncomment the line here

42
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.283
for the overall grade, the average.

43
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.889
And then we'll move down here to these tr's.

44
00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.240
We'll delete this hard-coded data,

45
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.620
those two table rows there, delete that.

46
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.560
And then we'll uncomment the section here

47
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.873
for the dynamic data.

48
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.000
Now let's go ahead and delete this hard-coded data here

49
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.143
for math grade.

50
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.220
And also there's one form line up here,

51
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.690
we want to delete this line

52
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.770
and then we'll uncomment the other lines of code here

53
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.400
and that's our form for adding new grades for math.

54
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.093
Now, let's move down here

55
00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:51.940
to the next section here for science assignments.

56
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.810
We'll delete the hard-coded line.

57
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.193
We'll uncomment this code here for the science average.

58
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.570
We'll remove these two hard-coded lines here for table row

59
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.680
and then we'll uncomment this section here

60
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.770
and now as you can see, this is kind of more the same.

61
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.080
So let's repeat the process here

62
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.503
for science grades and for history grades.

63
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.610
So I'll remove this hard-coded line here

64
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.280
and then I'll uncomment the code here for science grades.

65
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.670
Move on down here for history rates,

66
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.900
remove the hard-coded line.

67
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.050
And then we do an uncomment on this section

68
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:05.580
and remove the two hard-coded lines here for the tr's.

69
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.300
And we'll uncomment the section here

70
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.280
for the grades for history grades

71
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.680
and one last item here, delete that hard-coded line

72
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.370
and uncomment this section here

73
00:04:19.213 --> 00:04:21.089
for adding new history grades,

74
00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.280
the form for adding new history grades.

75
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.580
And that's pretty much it.
