00:00:01,388 --> 00:00:02,420
In this video we'll discuss

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,883
the Spring Boot MockBean annotation.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,900
So here's the code that we saw a little bit earlier,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,500
as far as creating a mock

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,610
and injecting the mock dependencies.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,520
And remember I said that this will only inject dependencies

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,980
annotated with Mock or Spy annotation.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,840
So this is the part, we'll talk about this right now.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,440
We'll discuss this limitation and how to resolve it.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,150
Now instead of using a Mockito, Mock, and InjectMocks,

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,140
we can make use of the Spring Boot support,

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,303
the annotations MockBean and also the Autowired annotation.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,060
So Spring Boot has the MockBean annotation,

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,780
so this annotation includes the Mockito Mock functionality.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,040
So that's already built in, it has that support.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,040
It also adds the MockBean to the spring application context,

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,130
so if an existing bean is already there, it'll replace it.

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,900
If there's nothing there, it'll add the new MockBean

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,400
to the Spring ApplicationContext.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,410
And this is really important

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,750
because now this makes the bean available

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,300
for injection with Autowired, and it basically removes

23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,660
that limitation that we discussed earlier.

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,493
So you may wonder, well

25
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:11,870
when should I use this annotation?

26
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,425
Use the Spring Boot MockBean annotation

27
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:18,610
when you need to inject mocks and you need to inject

28
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,300
regular beans from the application context,

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,510
and you want to avoid that given limitation

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,633
that we had earlier.

31
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,322
Here's the code that we had from before,

32
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:34,790
and now here's the new code using the Spring Boot support.

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,480
So one thing the imports so we no longer need

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,800
the Mockito mock or InjectMocks.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,810
Instead we'll make use of the

36
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,113
Spring Boot Mockito MockBean annotation.

37
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,560
The next line here, Mockito InjectMocks.

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,393
We no longer need that.

39
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:51,743
We can simply use a regular spring Autowired.

40
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,360
Here, where we actually create the mock for the DAO,

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,300
so instead of using the mock annotation from Mockito,

42
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,623
we'll make use of the MockBean annotation from Spring Boot.

43
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,760
So that'll basically create the mock for the DAO.

44
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,259
So instead of making use of InjectMocks from Mockito,

45
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,840
we make use of our regular spring AutoWired,

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,110
so this'll basically inject this given application service

47
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,130
and it's given dependencies will be resolved.

48
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,910
They'll be AutoWired in automatically

49
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,800
and then we'll have that support.

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,010
The nice thing about this approach is that

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,660
there's no longer a limitation.

52
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,240
We can inject any dependency.

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,860
It could be a mock dependency or a regular bean,

54
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,500
it'll be injected with no problem.

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,080
So this is a really good approach here.

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,515
If you're making use of Mockito with Spring Boot testing.

57
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,690
All right, so let's go ahead and move into the next video

58
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,990
and we'll make this update to our application.
