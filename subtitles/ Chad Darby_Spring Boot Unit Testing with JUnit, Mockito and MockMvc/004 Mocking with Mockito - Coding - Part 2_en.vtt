00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
All right.

2
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.143
So now we can start

3
00:00:02.143 --> 00:00:03.160
with our development process.

4
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.993
So in this video,

5
00:00:03.993 --> 00:00:04.826
we'll cover step one

6
00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:06.480
of creating the mock for the DAO

7
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.680
and then also injecting

8
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.013
the mock into the service.

9
00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:13.690
Give me one second here,

10
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.453
just to clean up all the tabs.

11
00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.060
Now, moving to our test section

12
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.273
and I'll create a new test class.

13
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.150
And for the name of the class

14
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.393
I'll call it Mock Annotation Test.

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.620
Let me expand the window here

16
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.333
for a second and zoom in.

17
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.463
And I'll start with

18
00:00:53.463 --> 00:00:55.527
our spring boot test annotation tab.

19
00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:59.163
I'll give it the name of our main class.

20
00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.110
And remember we have to do

21
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.670
this manual configuration since our packages

22
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.000
are different as far as our main code

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.953
and our test class.

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.680
I'll go ahead and set up some fields

25
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.143
here for the application context.

26
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.030
I'll auto wire in a student.

27
00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:41.680
And I'll also add to port

28
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.010
for student grades and we'll use

29
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.210
this a little bit later.

30
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.640
so I'll give a reference

31
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.511
here for application DAO

32
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:15.690
and I'll give the annotation at mock.

33
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.910
So we're effectively creating

34
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.780
a mock for the DAO.

35
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.723
So we're setting up our test double.

36
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.870
And I'll also define a field

37
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.030
here for application service.

38
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.139
We'll make use of the Annotation Inject Mocks

39
00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.233
that basically injects the mock dependencies.

40
00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:49.520
And now remember, this will only inject

41
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.210
the dependencies that are annotated with mock or spy.

42
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.236
It won't handle other classes

43
00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:55.800
that are auto wire without those dependencies,

44
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.970
but again, don't worry.

45
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.410
I'll cover that scenario

46
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.873
in some upcoming videos.

47
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.123
All right, let's go ahead

48
00:03:12.123 --> 00:03:13.750
and create a before each method.

49
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.190
We basically want to just initialize

50
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.770
a student with some given data

51
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.320
as far as their name and so on.

52
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.340
I have before each

53
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.760
i have student one and that's red

54
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.593
i wonder why.

55
00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.880
Okay scrolling up top

56
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.713
I see we have it

57
00:03:30.713 --> 00:03:31.546
called college student.

58
00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:33.240
I want to replace that name,

59
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.543
college student, and college student one.

60
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.760
So that's the field name

61
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.463
that I want to use student one.

62
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.660
And now I can say student one,

63
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.650
I'll set the first name

64
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.850
the last name

65
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.193
and the email address.

66
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.300
And then finally I'll set the student grades

67
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.450
for this given student.

68
00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:21.269
Okay, great.

69
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.430
So that kind of wraps it up

70
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.333
here for that before each method.
