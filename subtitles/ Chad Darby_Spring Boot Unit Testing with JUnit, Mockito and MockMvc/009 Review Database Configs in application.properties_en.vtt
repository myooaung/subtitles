00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.340
Now what I'd like to do is I'd like

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.760
to go through and actually take a look

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.580
at our application.properties file

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.780
and review some of the properties we have in there

5
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.573
for our database configuration.

6
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.660
First thing I'll do is I'll actually un-comment

7
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.943
these properties here.

8
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.903
Make sure we remove all the comments.

9
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.860
Now we'll take a look at the properties.

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.450
The first four properties here for URL,

11
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.160
driver, username, and password,

12
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.210
they're all self-explanatory; just basic properties

13
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.200
that we need for connecting to a database.

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.793
You've used this in previous JDBC coding in the past.

15
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.544
The next item here, datasource.initialization-mode=always;

16
00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:43.133
this means that it'll automatically create

17
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.796
the database schema regardless of the data source type

18
00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:47.296
that you're using.

19
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.160
Next, we have database-platform.

20
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.820
What we're doing here is we're saying, hey,

21
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.730
this is the actual dialect you should use for the database.

22
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.340
Remember, different SQL databases have some things

23
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.500
that are slightly different, like Oracle,

24
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.810
and Postgres, and MySQL, and H2.

25
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.450
They have some small little differences here and there.

26
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.370
What we're doing here is we're telling it, hey,

27
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.763
use the H2 dialect because we're using the H2 database.

28
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.180
We have some other entries here as far as

29
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.750
the console enabled.

30
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.520
The H2 database has a Web console.

31
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.150
Also, the jpa.show-sql.

32
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.233
We want to show all the SQL statements in the logs.

33
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.330
The one entry I'd like to talk about here

34
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.550
is the ddl-auto.

35
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.810
At the moment, we have it set to create-drop.

36
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.830
What does this mean?

37
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.000
With this configuration, behind the scene,

38
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.980
it'll actually drop the existing tables,

39
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.880
then it'll create new tables.

40
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.300
After those operations are done,

41
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.410
it'll actually drop the database schema.

42
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.263
This approach is commonly used for integration testing.

43
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.510
That's pretty much it for our database config,

44
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.170
so you can go ahead and just save the latest

45
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.640
that you have here and we'll use this

46
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.123
in the follow-on videos.
