1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,620
All righty. So we have the failing test.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,830
Now let's go ahead and write the code

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,000
to make this test pass.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,763
Let's go from red to green.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,670
I'll move into my grade book controller and I'll go ahead

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,683
and add some new coding here for this.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,070
In particular, we need to add code here

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,393
for the post mapping.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,130
We'll set up this method here for create grade.

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,830
We add code to handle

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,730
for the different parameters coming in,

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,443
grade, gradeType, and studentId.

13
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,030
And the first thing we'd like to do here is that

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,560
if the student doesn't exist,

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,393
then we simply want to return error.

16
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,540
All righty, that code looks good.

17
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,240
Next, we want to actually create the grade

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,603
using our student service.

19
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,410
And then we pass in the parameters.

20
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,150
Now we'd like to check if there's a failure

21
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,993
for creating the grade, then we want to return error.

22
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,823
Let's go ahead and retrieve the student information.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,690
And give me a second here.

24
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,570
I'd like to reuse some code

25
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,920
to populate the student information in the model attributes.

26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,090
I use the words reuse lightly

27
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,710
because at the moment, please forgive me,

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm going to copy, paste the code for now.

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,640
It's kind of dirty, ugh, but we'll actually clean this up

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,890
in some of the upcoming videos.

31
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,723
So don't worry.

32
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:30,240
So kind of work with me for now.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,490
In some future videos, we'll kind of refactor our code

34
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,190
and make it pretty and make it clean.

35
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,643
But we'll go ahead and just do the copy, paste for now.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,130
I'll move up here to this one section of code,

37
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,370
where we did all the work for the model attributes.

38
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,320
Let's just go ahead and copy that code.

39
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,640
And then we'll move down here into our method

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,040
that we're working on and we'll simply paste it.

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,140
All right, so that adds all of the averages

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,643
for the grades to the model attribute.

43
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,403
All righty, let's swing over here and run our test.

44
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,180
This test passes.

45
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,013
Awesome.

46
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:16,310
So we were successful here in creating a valid grade

47
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,120
by sending over data to that given endpoint.

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,530
Now as promised, in the next video,

49
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,690
we'll go through and we'll clean this code up a bit,

50
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,840
and making it a bit more pretty.

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,530
But at least we have our tests working.

52
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,363
Good job.
