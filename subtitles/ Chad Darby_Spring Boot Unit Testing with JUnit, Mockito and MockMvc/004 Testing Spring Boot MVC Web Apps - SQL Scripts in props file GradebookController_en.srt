1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,600
Alrighty. So we're almost done.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,350
So our final step here is refactoring

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,480
the before each and after each to make use of

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,183
the variables instead of the hardcoded SQL.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,160
So let's move down here to the before each.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,993
So we have all of that

7
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:20,980
hardcoded data and we can remove that data.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,403
So just delete all of that.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,760
And now we'll simply make use

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,740
of the variables that we've created.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,470
Here I'll make use of JDBC Execute,

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,913
SQL add student.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,560
And I'll do a similar thing here for math student.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,920
And actually let me change that.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,030
It shouldn't be math student.

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,460
It should be math grade.

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,290
Quick little Refactoring here.

18
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:00,370
Okay, good.

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,230
That looks better.

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,510
Okay.

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,343
I like that.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,540
And now let's just kind of repeat the process here for

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,493
science grade and also history grade.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,270
So we remove the hardcoded SQL

25
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,790
and now we're making use of the variables.

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,623
I like it.

27
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:28,456
I like it.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,440
Now, let's go ahead and move down to the

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,470
after each and do a similar thing.

30
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,970
So I remove all of the hardcoded SQL

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,070
and I'll simply make use of the variables.

32
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:54,688
Here, we'll say execute SQL, delete student,

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,110
and SQL delete math grade and a similar thing here

34
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,963
for science grade and history grade.

35
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,230
All righty.

36
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,600
So this code looks really good.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,863
Let's go ahead and run this test.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,500
And we're running the test and,

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,300
oh, this is weird.

40
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,470
Test failed.

41
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,610
Huh?

42
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,000
Interesting.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,160
Let's see here could not resolve placeholder

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,460
SQL script create student.

45
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:51,674
Oh, oh, okay.

46
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:55,350
So I might have a mismatch or a typo on the names.

47
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,310
Hmm. Okay.

48
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,940
Let's go double check this.

49
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,240
So this person says SQL script create student,

50
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,690
looking in the, ah, okay.

51
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,390
Typo and application and properties.

52
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,250
Notice here it says SQL scripts.

53
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,580
There's an extra S after the script.

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,663
Ah, let's remove that, right?

55
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,300
Now we save that and now we can

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,433
run our test and

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,550
yes, everything passes now.

58
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,170
All is well with the world.

59
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,150
Ah, woo.

60
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,140
That's scary there for a moment.

61
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,640
So, small typo that we have there and our tests fail

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,300
but we're able to resolve it.

63
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,110
And now all of the tests pass.

64
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,943
So I like this.

65
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:35,776
Very good.

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,890
And now there's one other thing I want to do here

67
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,490
is I want to make the same SQL modifications

68
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,730
to the grade book controller test.

69
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,980
We've covered it for the student grade service test.

70
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,830
Now let's do a similar thing

71
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,993
for the grade book controller test.

72
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,440
And what we'll do is we'll actually just copy a lot

73
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,480
of the code from our student

74
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,200
and grade service test and we'll paste it

75
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,160
over into great book controller test.

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,020
Starting in student and grade service test.

77
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,973
Let's go ahead and copy this code.

78
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,940
And now let's move over to our great book controller test

79
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,563
and let's paste in this code.

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,012
Excellent.

81
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,820
And then we also need to copy the coding

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,460
from before each and do a similar thing.

83
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,053
So over in student and grade service test, copy,

84
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,093
move back over to our grade book controller, test and paste.

85
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,250
And let's just repeat the exercise here

86
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,190
for the after each,

87
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,070
copy from student

88
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,343
and grade service test,

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,403
move over to great with controller test and paste.

90
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,720
Excellent.

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,200
Now we can kind of step back

92
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,110
and we can just run all

93
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,563
of our tests and see how things work out for us.

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,433
And as we can see

95
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:04,740
there's a lot of green check marks here, everything passed.

96
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,860
So in really good shape.

97
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,300
So, we've accomplished our goal here of

98
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,155
removing that hardcoded SQL from our test,

99
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:12,630
putting in a properties file and then

100
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,250
refactoring our code accordingly.

101
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,230
So I like to say,

102
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,373
good job, my friend.
