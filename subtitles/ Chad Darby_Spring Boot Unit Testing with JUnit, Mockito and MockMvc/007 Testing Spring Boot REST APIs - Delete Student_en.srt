00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,030
In this video, we'll write a test for deleting a student.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,960
We'll create this test by sending

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,470
over a delete request to this endpoint.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,740
So we'll say delete/student/ID

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,960
and ID refers to the student ID.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,793
And then we'll make sure that

7
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:18,980
that student was actually deleted

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,810
from the backend.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,163
Alrighty, let's go ahead and swing into our IDE.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,490
So we'll get started here

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,870
on our grade book controller test

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,393
and we'll write a new test.

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,180
And this is the test for deleting a student.

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,020
And what I'll do here is

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,660
I'll make sure the student exists

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,860
before I actually delete them.

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,410
So I'll check to make sure

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,853
that the student ID of 1 is present.

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,870
And now I'll delete the student

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,550
by performing a delete request to /student/ID.

21
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,110
I'll pass in the ID of 1

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,690
and then I'll verify the results.

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,753
Here I'll expect the status is okay.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,993
And now I'll verify the size of the array.

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,230
We initially had one student

26
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,080
but we just deleted the student.

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,573
The JSON Array should now be zero.

28
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,760
And also I'd like to just double check this

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,419
by checking the DAO

30
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,880
and seeing if that student ID of 1 is out there.

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,810
So we want to confirm

32
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,793
that student ID of 1 was deleted.

33
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,190
All right, let's go ahead and run our test

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
and the test passes.

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,393
So this is great.

36
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:27,500
So we know that we've deleted the actual student

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,140
from the backend database.

38
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,973
This is great.

39
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:30,806
I love it.
