00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.750
Alrighty, so let's get down to work.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.880
I'm getting a bit excited here.

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.890
I'm ready to write that passing test.

4
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.510
So let's dive in.

5
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.300
I'll open up my Gradebook Controller.

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.860
I'll move down to this section here

7
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.183
and I'll add some new functionality.

8
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.930
I'll add the request mapping to delete the grade

9
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.940
via the HTTP request.

10
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.540
So we'll have this GET/grades/id/gradeType.

11
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.373
Now I'll actually delete the grade from the database.

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.400
I'll set up the path variables here for ID and gradeType.

13
00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:01.750
And at the moment here, I'll just kind of stub it out.

14
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.960
I'll simply just return student information,

15
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.400
but I won't do any of the real work yet.

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.183
Just kind of get this item in place here.

17
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.370
I want to do a quick run of my tests just to see where I'm at.

18
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.450
Alrighty, the test fails.

19
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.820
I'm just scrolling up a bit, so expected false, actual true.

20
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.550
Okay, that's fine, we haven't done the real work yet,

21
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.250
but at least we have some of the coding in place here.

22
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.460
Now let's swing back over to our Gradebook Controller

23
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.030
and let's go ahead and write the real functionality.

24
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.760
I'll go ahead and use my studentService

25
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.930
and I'll delete the grade.

26
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.907
I'll pass in the grade ID and also the gradeType.

27
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.190
And that'll return the student ID

28
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.240
that this given grade is associated with.

29
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.840
Now, if the student ID is zero, that means that

30
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.919
it didn't find a student associated with that grade.

31
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:11.940
So this is an error.

32
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.233
So I'll return error in this situation.

33
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.160
So we've already deleted the grade,

34
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.430
I'll simply make use of our helper method,

35
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.813
configureStudentInformationModel,

36
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.990
adding our information to the model.

37
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.770
That's said, refactor code that we had earlier.

38
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.570
So we'll simply leverage that again.

39
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.223
Now we can go back and run our test.

40
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.710
And now this is really good news.

41
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.173
So now we see that our test passed.

42
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.883
This is really good, I like it.
