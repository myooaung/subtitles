1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's cover some other scenarios here ,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,090
we'll make use of assertTrue, assertFalse,

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,850
and also assertNotNull.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,273
I'll add a new test here to compare grades.

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,080
We'll check to see if the grade of 90

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,073
is greater than the grade of 75.

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,003
We run that and we see that the test passes as desired.

8
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,070
Then we'll do a similar thing here

9
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,547
and we'll check for false.

10
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,343
AssertFalse, student grades that is greater. 89,92.

11
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,193
We execute this test and this one passes also.

12
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,960
And then we'll add one more test here

13
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,812
for checking null values.

14
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,720
If not coding here we say assertNotNull, student grades.

15
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,553
Check null.

16
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,090
And then we execute this test, and this test passes A-Okay.

17
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,923
Good job.

18
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,450
All right, so this looks good.

19
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,730
So just a quick example of using assertTrue, assertFalse

20
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,130
and assertNotNull.
