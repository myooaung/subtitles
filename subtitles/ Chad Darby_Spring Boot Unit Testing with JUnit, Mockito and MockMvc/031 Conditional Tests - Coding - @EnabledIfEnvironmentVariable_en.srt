1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,469
All righty, so we're almost done.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,450
So here, we'll wrap it up with EnabledIfSystemProperty,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,470
and also EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable.

4
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,920
So let's just copy this test

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,793
and paste it down here for a second.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,393
And I'll update the method name here, so it's unique.

7
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,757
It's OnlyForDevEnvironment.

8
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:44,756
I'll EnableIfEnvironmentVariable is set.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,280
So I give the name of the environment,

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,803
so named=.

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,880
And I'll call it, LUV2CODE_ENV.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,560
We can give any name,

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,830
and I'll say matches on a given regular expression,

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,670
so here I'll just have a direct match, I'll call it DEV.

15
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,863
So that's our environment name, DEV.

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,660
And I'll just copy this test and paste it one more time.

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,663
And for this one, I'll make use of system properties.

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,363
So, system property.

19
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,120
And the name of this system property

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,123
I'll call it LUV2CODE_SYS_PROP.

21
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,300
And then I'll give matches and I'll just make something up

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,593
as far as like CI_CD_DEPLOY or something.

23
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,660
I'll just update the method name here to system properties.

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,730
So these are the two methods here

25
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,380
checking for our environment variable

26
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,493
and also checking for system property.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,223
Now let's zoom out for a bit and let's execute the test.

28
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,640
And then we'll see testOnlyForDevEnvironment.

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,260
We'll see that fails because the environment doesn't exist

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,940
and system property that fails

31
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,130
because that given property doesn't exist.

32
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,410
Okay, that makes sense, right?

33
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,475
because we haven't really done anything.

34
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:30,380
(chuckles)

35
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,170
We just wrote some tests where we didn't configure

36
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,533
our system accordingly.

37
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,163
So you may wonder

38
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:38,610
how do we set these actual properties here?

39
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,350
We can simply update our run configuration in IntelliJ.

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,743
So I'll just modify the run configuration.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,150
And for environment variables

42
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,840
we simply give a name value pair.

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,970
So LUV2CODE_ENV=DEV.

44
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,503
That's a name value pair.

45
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,320
That matches with the actual item

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,653
that we have for the annotation here in this code example.

47
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,830
And based on this when we run the test,

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,200
then it should execute that given test method.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,900
So let's go ahead and test it out.

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,990
And we see that we have some success here.

51
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,610
So testOnlyForDevEnvironment that executed

52
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,690
because that given environment variable was set

53
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,523
and it matched.

54
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:32,356
Awesome.

55
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,880
Now let's do a similar thing here for a system property.

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,780
So again, we're modifying the run configurations.

57
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,910
So for our system properties,

58
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,010
we make use of it right here on the command line with a -D,

59
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,800
that means a system property,

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,300
and then you give the name value pair.

61
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,930
So the property name is LUV2CODE_SYS_PROP=

62
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:58,560
and in this example CI_CD_DEPLOY.

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,883
Again, matching with what we have on that given annotation.

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,060
All right, so go ahead and zoom out real quick

65
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,000
and let's hit okay.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,800
And let's go ahead and run this one.

67
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,310
So at the moment, the property is not set,

68
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,610
then we execute it and then everything's A-OK.

69
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,560
So that new run configuration was applied

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,980
and that system property set.

71
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,900
Okay, excellent, great.

72
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,190
So, in this video, we saw some good examples here

73
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,530
of running tests based on environment variables

74
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,430
and also running tests based if system properties were set.

75
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,090
So I'm pretty excited here

76
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,080
and I like that we've covered some really good stuff.

77
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,943
Good job, my friend.
