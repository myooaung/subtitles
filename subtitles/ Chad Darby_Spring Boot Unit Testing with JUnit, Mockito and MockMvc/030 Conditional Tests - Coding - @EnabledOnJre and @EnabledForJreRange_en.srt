1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,013
All righty.

2
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:03,080
So we're making some really good progress here.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,310
So in this video, we'll cover EnabledOnJre

4
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:08,290
and EnabledOnJreRange.

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,543
So we'll basically check the Java versions.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,260
We're just move in here and copy one of the test methods

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,233
and paste it a couple of times.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,830
So I pasted it twice.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,533
So zoom in here for a second,

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,493
let's testOnlyForJava17.

11
00:00:30,772 --> 00:00:33,439
I'll update the annotation here.

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,053
So EnabledOnJre and then I give the actual JRE version.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,003
So in this example, Java 17.

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,490
I'll just copy this annotation paste it down here

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,223
and I'll test it for Java 13.

16
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,983
Okay, great.

17
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:11,580
So these given test one will run only for Java 17

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,930
the other one will run only for Java 13.

19
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,930
Go ahead and run it.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,220
So at the moment I'm running on Java 17

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,550
this one is disabled for Java 13

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,193
and the one for Java 17 of course will execute.

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,023
And let's play around with range and also minimum use here.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,137
So we'll have this one set up for EnabledForJreRange.

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,470
We can give a minimum and a maximum.

26
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,123
So I'll say man of 13, max of 18.

27
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:15,870
And then I'll copy this one and paste it

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,023
and I'll do a slight tweak on it.

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,840
Just have minimum, I'll remove the max part of it.

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,063
So min Java 13, actually I'll change it to Java 11.

31
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,640
Minimum of Java 11.

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,103
So this will work on Java 11 or higher.

33
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,260
So those are the two new updates

34
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,053
that we added for this section.

35
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,683
Zoom out for a bit and run our test.

36
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,300
All righty, so this looks pretty good.

37
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,720
So we see for the range portion of it.

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,720
So testOnlyforJavaRange, that one executed good.

39
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,420
Good because it met the requirements

40
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,510
and then test only for Java range men

41
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,670
that executed also

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,660
because it met the requirements of a minimum of Java 11.

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,390
All right, so this part worked out for is pretty good.

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,030
So really good examples here

45
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,540
of conditional testing with Junit.

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,223
All righty, good job.
