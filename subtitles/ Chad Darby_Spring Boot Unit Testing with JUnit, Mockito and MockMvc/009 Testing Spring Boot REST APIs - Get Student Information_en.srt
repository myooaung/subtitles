1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,730
In this video we'll cover a test

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,163
for student information.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,970
So we'll create a test to retrieve the student information.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,880
We'll get the student's name, email address

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,923
and student grade.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,040
And we'll basically send over a get request

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,610
that is slash student information slash ID

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,260
and we'll pass in the student ID.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,910
Okay, let's go ahead and swing into our ID

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,163
and let's get started.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,783
So I'll write this new test here for student information.

12
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:49,520
And the first thing what I'll do here is I'll actually

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,130
retrieve the student from the DAO.

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,350
So I'll retrieve student ID of one

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,850
and I'll make sure that that given student exists.

16
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,060
And then I'll use the mock NBC to perform a get request

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,030
to that slash student information endpoint

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,433
and I'll pass in the student ID of one.

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,140
So for the variable here are passing student idea of one.

20
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,230
And then I want to check that the status is okay

21
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,130
meaning that everything is successful.

22
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,653
And also check the content type.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,137
And let's just do a quick run of this

24
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:51,270
just to kind of make sure this piece works.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,260
So there's more work we're going to do

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,263
but let's just do a quick test.

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,660
All right, so we know that we're getting a success code.

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,040
That's coming back, that's fine.

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,770
But now let's go ahead and get some details here

30
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,500
on the actual JSON that's returned

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,603
or verify the JSN that's returned.

32
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,900
I can make use of JSON path to go ahead

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,130
and check for the actual student ID.

34
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,993
So I use the dollar sign dot id.

35
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,280
Is one, again we're just using JSON path

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,633
here to verify the contents of that JSON response.

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
Dollar sign dot first name

38
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,383
Eric

39
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,660
and then a similar thing here

40
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,160
for the other field's last name and email address.

41
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,660
All right, so this is great.

42
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,320
We can use JSON path to actually verify the contents

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,910
of that JSON response.

44
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,860
Okay, let's go ahead and run this test.

45
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,170
And excellent, everything is green here.

46
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,580
So this test passed, so we were able to verify

47
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,960
That we can get the student information

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,330
For a given student ID

49
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,030
And also verify the actual JSON response.

50
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,863
Good job.
