00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:01.640
All righty.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.760
So we're moving right along.

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.060
In this video, we'll read the application properties,

4
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.233
and also inject some spring beans.

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.840
Under our source main resources,

6
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.320
we have our application.properties file,

7
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.300
and we have a collection of name value pairs here

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.590
or properties.

9
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.400
And what we want to do is reference some

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.453
of these values in our spring boot test.

11
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.623
And I can access those by using the @Value annotation.

12
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.083
Just to get started,

13
00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:32.159
I'll go ahead and set up a static counter here.

14
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.413
We'll make use of it later in one of our test methods.

15
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.593
And then we'll go ahead and access the app info.

16
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.850
Here, I'll give the @Value, dollar sign curly brace,

17
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.420
and then give the name of the actual property,

18
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.523
which is info.app.name.

19
00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.830
And I'll just take this, and I'll copy paste it

20
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.380
X number of times for some of the other properties.

21
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.583
So I'll update this one for app description,

22
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.793
and an app version,

23
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.853
and school name.

24
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.450
And we had an extra one down here.

25
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.833
We actually don't need this one, so I'll delete it.

26
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.920
All right. So we've read in all of those properties here,

27
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.010
and just verifying what we have up top.

28
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.210
So this all matches up.

29
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.020
We can actually access those properties here

30
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.513
on our spring boot test.

31
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.240
And then I'll inject some spring beans.

32
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.990
So I'll inject the college student,

33
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.653
and I'll also inject the student grades.

34
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.800
Let me stretch out here

35
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.823
and get myself some room to work with.

36
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.700
I'll set up a before each method

37
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.733
that'll run before each one of our test.

38
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.420
And I'll simply add some diagnostics,

39
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.133
and some initialization work here in this method.

40
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.370
And as far as the diagnostic work,

41
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.570
I'll just print out some

42
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.583
of our properties that we've read in.

43
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.830
I'll also do some initialization work

44
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.830
on our student object that we autowired.

45
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.670
Okay. So this method looks pretty good.

46
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.970
Let's go ahead and run the test.

47
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.220
We'll take a look at the output.

48
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.570
And this information that you see here

49
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.000
testing my super cool grade book,

50
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.470
that's information that we're reading

51
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.850
from the application.properties file.

52
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.640
And this appears because of the @ before each.

53
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.830
So the method that runs every time

54
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.940
before each one of the tests,

55
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.740
and we also have our counter there to keep track

56
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.070
of how many times we've executed that given item.

57
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.410
All right. So this looks pretty good.

58
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.243
I like it.
