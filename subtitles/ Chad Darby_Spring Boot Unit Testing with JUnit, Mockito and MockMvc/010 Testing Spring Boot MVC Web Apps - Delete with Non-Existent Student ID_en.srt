00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:03,730
In this video, I want to test for deleting a grade.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,420
I'm going to cover two specific edge cases.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,940
One is the case of deleting an invalid grade id,

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,350
and the other case is deleting an invalid subject.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,900
In these cases, both should return zero,

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,510
because there is no student id

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,713
that can match with these given scenarios.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,840
All right, let's swing into our IDE.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,290
Let's start writing our code.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,330
Let's open up our student in grade service test

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,520
and zoom in for a second,

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,613
and we'll define a new test method.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,060
The test method is delete grade service

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,943
return student id of zero.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,250
Let me scroll up a bit.

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,083
Okay, great.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,190
Now do an assert equals zero,

18
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,099
so, the student id should be zero.

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,440
And then I'll make use of student service delete grade.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,520
I give the grade id, and then the actual subject.

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,470
So, a grade id of zero, subject of science.

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,930
In this scenario, a student should not have

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,563
a grade id of zero for science.

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,810
Now, let's go ahead and write our

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,180
other test here for an invalid subject.

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,450
So, here is student service delete grade id of 1

27
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,853
grade type of literature.

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,430
In this case, it should return to student id of zero,

29
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,520
because no student should have a literature class,

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,120
because it's an invalid subject.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,400
Okay, so the coding here looks pretty good.

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,063
Let's go ahead and run this test,

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,860
and we can see that the test passed.

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,693
This is excellent.

35
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,230
So that we know that our code can handle

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,039
those edge cases of an invalid grade id,

37
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,140
and also an invalid subject.

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,320
So this looks really good.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,153
I like it.
