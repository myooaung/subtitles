00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.960
In this video, we'll cover the updates

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.427
for the Gradebook UI.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.280
Now just as a checkpoint, at the moment

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.910
we've developed tests for creating a student

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.670
and also getting a list of students.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.240
So all of our backend code has been tested

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.800
and we have a good level of confidence that that part works.

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.333
So we're good on the backend.

9
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.220
However, we still have some work to do

10
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.670
because the current UI has hard coded HTML.

11
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.160
It doesn't really do anything.

12
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.540
So if you remember earlier in the course

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.380
when we ran our application,

14
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.180
we had a user interface come up, but it didn't really work.

15
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.760
It was all kind of hard coded.

16
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.200
So we have some work to do.

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.380
And the first thing we have to do is update the index

18
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.510
at HTML to have the form submit data

19
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.683
to the Gradebook controller on the backend.

20
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.590
And then we also need to update the index HTML

21
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.440
to display a list of students using a for loop,

22
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.530
and basically looping over the students model attribute.

23
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.030
At the moment we have three students on our UI,

24
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.360
but they're hard coded.

25
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.840
Instead, we'll make use of the for loop

26
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.510
to loop over those students from that model attribute

27
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.980
and display each person.

28
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.300
All right.
So that's our game plan.

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.130
Let's go ahead. Moving to our IDE and dial.

30
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.030
Let's get started.

31
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.819
Okay.
One thing that we need

32
00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.640
to do is that we need to make a minor code update.

33
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.960
This is to try and keep the videos in sync

34
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.200
with the code that we have.

35
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.630
So there are some small issues with the recording.

36
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.830
And so let's just go ahead and make this minor code update.

37
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.490
So open up the file GradebookControllerTest.java

38
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.113
and we need to rename one of the fields.

39
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.210
And we need to rename the studentANDGradeServiceMock.

40
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.647
We need to rename it to studentCreateServiceMock.

41
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.903
All right.

42
00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:48.920
So go ahead and make this update in the file

43
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.250
and save it accordingly.

44
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.280
And then this'll keep your code and sync

45
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.640
with everything that you'll see in the following videos.

46
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.940
So just a minor code update.

47
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.940
All righty.
Thanks.

48
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.953
All right.

49
00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:05.630
So we're in our IDE, let's go ahead and take a look

50
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.323
at that Gradebook controller.

51
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.710
And what we'd like to do is, here there's code

52
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.640
for getting a list of students.

53
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.470
We'd also like to do a similar thing

54
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.780
When we create the student.

55
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.440
Once we create a student, we'd also like to get a list

56
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.363
of students and set that as a model attribute.

57
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.376
What I'll do is I'll swing back over to my test

58
00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:29.990
and I'll add a small bit of test code in here

59
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.349
just to make sure that we can assert equals

60
00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.830
on list or intervals.

61
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.040
So let me go ahead and create a college student

62
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.073
just for a second.

63
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.907
I'll create this college student("Eric", "Roby"),

64
00:03:00.631 --> 00:03:04.881
and I'll simply add this college student to a list.

65
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.700
Okay. So that code looks pretty good.

66
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.453
Now I'll set up a mock for the student service.

67
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.300
Here I'll say, studentCreateServiceMock.getGradebook,

68
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.657
and then I'll say thenReturn(collegeStudentList).

69
00:03:39.644 --> 00:03:41.820
And then I'll simply do a really quick test here

70
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.100
on assert interval equals.

71
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.707
The college student list comma.

72
00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:47.360
Then I'll make use of that mock

73
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.060
and then I'll say, get grade book.

74
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.163
Let me just run this test real quick.

75
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.333
Okay, excellent.

76
00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.160
So this test runs just fine.

77
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.993
Now let's go ahead

78
00:04:10.993 --> 00:04:13.350
and do a similar thing here and our controller.

79
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.570
So we're in grade book controller right now.

80
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.100
And what we're going to do is we're going to add code such

81
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.100
that after we create this student, then we'll get a list

82
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.353
of students and add them as a model attribute.

83
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.267
Here I'll set as college students equals student serviced.

84
00:04:37.267 --> 00:04:38.773
get grade book.

85
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.350
And now I'll simply add this

86
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.240
as a model attribute the name students

87
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.600
and then the reference here to college students.

88
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.420
So effectively, once we add a new student

89
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.170
then we simply get a list of all the student

90
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.860
from the database, basically getting the latest list

91
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.533
adding that as a model attribute.

92
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.460
And what I'd like to do is just run all of my tests again

93
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.560
just to make sure everything still passes.

94
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.880
Okay, great.

95
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.030
Everything still passes.

96
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.320
So we're in good shape right now.

97
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.420
Great. So all of the back end code is in place.

98
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.470
Let's move to the next video

99
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.420
and we'll start working on the UE code.
