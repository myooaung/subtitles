00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.243
Now let's go ahead and pull in some other data files.

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.443
And our source code directory that you downloaded earlier.

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.200
Spring boot unit testing main.

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.300
Then we have another directory here called

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.383
1.11 fizzbuzz test data files.

6
00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.973
1.11 fizzbuzz test data files.

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.140
You can move into this directory

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.940
and we have a number of files here.

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.030
Let's go ahead and grab the medium and large test data

10
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.093
and copy those.

11
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.570
And now let's move back into our IDE

12
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.070
and we'll paste those files in.

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.280
So again, in the test section, under resources,

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.743
we'll paste those two files.

15
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.670
Okay, great. So we have our medium test data.csv,

16
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.230
take a quick look at it.

17
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.550
It goes from 1

18
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.390
all the way down to 50.

19
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.223
Okay, great.

20
00:01:02.223 --> 00:01:05.150
So, the first 50 numbers for FizzBuzz.

21
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.970
And another one, large test data CSV

22
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.820
and this one goes all the way down to 100.

23
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.280
Cool. So we have some other data files

24
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.733
that we can play with here.

25
00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:17.240
And what I'll do here is I'll actually create separate tests

26
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.440
for each one of the files.

27
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.930
We could also do 'em all at the same time

28
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.770
but here I'll just kind of make 'em separate

29
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.403
just for academic purposes here.

30
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.723
And here we have medium,

31
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.913
medium test data,

32
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.210
update the order

33
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.193
and update the method name.

34
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.110
And I'll just run this real quick.

35
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.440
And testing with medium test data failed.

36
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.120
Hmm. Interesting.

37
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.130
Okay. That's the right file name.

38
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.933
Medium test data.

39
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.236
Okay. Hmm.

40
00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:15.069
Okay. Hmm.

41
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.663
More actions, nothing there.

42
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.270
And just taking a look,

43
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.043
make sure I didn't use the wrong file name.

44
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.300
Okay. Now I remember this issue.

45
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.150
We simply need to do a rebuild on our project

46
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.970
in order for all of the data files

47
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.830
to make it into the appropriate directories.

48
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.823
So, under build, choose rebuild project.

49
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.010
All right. So the project is now rebuilt.

50
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.003
Now let's run our test one more time.

51
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.870
And excellent.

52
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.703
Okay, great.

53
00:03:03.703 --> 00:03:06.920
So that little rebuild thing helped us with our data file.

54
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.590
So now testing with medium data file that passes okay

55
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.700
and we see all the different items out there that passed.

56
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.920
Okay. This is really, really good.

57
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.910
All the way down to 50.

58
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.060
Really good. I like it.

59
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.290
And now let's do a similar thing for the large data file.

60
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.920
And simply update the display name, the source

61
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.198
and the order and method name.

62
00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:41.698
and the order and method name.

63
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.550
All right. So that's the info there

64
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.610
for testing the large data file.

65
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.610
Go ahead and run it.

66
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.590
And yes, success.

67
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.610
So the large data file worked also.

68
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.247
And remember, the large data file had values

69
00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:06.080
all the way from 1 to 100.

70
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.480
all the way from 1 to 100.

71
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.640
Excellent. And each one of those items pass.

72
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.523
Great. Good job.

73
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.110
Okay, so, good examples here

74
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.070
of just using CSV data files.

75
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.570
We started with a small file,

76
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.820
we went to a medium, large and you can make use

77
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.940
of any number of files here for testing.

78
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.180
So this is a really good way of having parameterized tests

79
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.570
and just kind of seeing everything in action.

80
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.353
So I'd like to say, good job my friend.
