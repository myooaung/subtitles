00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.200
All righty, so let's get started

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.490
with our development process,

3
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.830
and this video will cover step one

4
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.042
of adding the SQL to the application.properties file.

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.720
Let's take a quick look

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.530
at our student and grade service test.

7
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.510
So at the moment here this is why we have the hard coded SQL

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.793
in the before each.

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.413
And now let's go ahead

10
00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:27.250
and open up our application.properties file,

11
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.383
and let's add the SQL here.

12
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.150
Let me stretch out a bit,

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.113
give myself some room to work with.

14
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.313
And now I'll add the SQL to create a student.

15
00:01:36.923 --> 00:01:38.120
Notice here I use the back slash

16
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.050
to give myself a line break,

17
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.420
mainly just to kind of keep everything on the screen.

18
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.760
However when this is processed,

19
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.900
it'll be processed as one SQL statement,

20
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.353
as one big long string.

21
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.330
And now let me zoom in here

22
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.953
and do a similar thing for are creating a math grade.

23
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.943
And then I repeat the process here for a science grade,

24
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.363
and also for history grade.

25
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.160
Next I'll go ahead and write the SQL statements to delete.

26
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.360
We'll have code here for deleting a student,

27
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.800
and then a similar thing here

28
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.860
for deleting math grade,

29
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.173
science grade, and also history grade.

30
00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.610
All righty, so this coding looks good here for the moment.
