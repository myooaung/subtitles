00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,253
In this video, we'll cover tests for create grades.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,320
So we'll develop a test for creating grades.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,690
And what we'll do here is we'll actually send

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,500
over a post to /grades

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,010
and we'll pass over three parameters.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,260
We'll pass over the grade,

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,293
the grade type and the student ID.

8
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,070
All righty, looks pretty exciting.

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,023
Let's dive in.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,940
All righty, swinging into grade book controller test.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,890
Let's go ahead and write this new test.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,790
What we'll do here is use our mock MVC,

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,640
we'll perform a post /grades

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,650
and we'll pass over these three parameters,

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,703
grade, grade type and student ID.

16
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,130
And then once that's processed in,

17
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,570
then we simply expect that this will successful.

18
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,023
So the status is okay.

19
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,120
Then we also check the content type

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,660
and then we can verify the actual JSON response here

21
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,970
by making use of our JSON path.

22
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,280
So a similar technique that we used

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,570
in some of the previous videos.

24
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,190
So $.id and a similar thing here

25
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,390
for first name, last name and email address.

26
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,180
And then also we can access the student grades

27
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,533
for math grade results.

28
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,250
Now we initially had one math grade.

29
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,450
The test just added a second math grade.

30
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,000
That means that we should now have two math grades.

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,810
All righty, let's go ahead and run this test.

32
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,803
And excellent.

33
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:38,636
All green here.

34
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:39,469
So this test passed.

35
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,610
So we were able to successfully create a new grade

36
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,520
and verify it using our test here.

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,353
Good job!
