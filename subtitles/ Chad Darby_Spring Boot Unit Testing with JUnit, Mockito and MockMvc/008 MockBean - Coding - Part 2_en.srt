00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,840
Let's zoom in here

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,673
and let's write another test.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,177
And I'll write a test here for checking for "Not Null".

4
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:36,060
And I'll say when applicationDao.checkNull

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,890
then return true, so that's my expectation

6
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,890
that I'm setting up.

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,840
And then I'll perform the assert,

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,833
so I'll assertNotNull app service checkNull.

9
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:14,193
And then we'll run this test and we see that it passes.

10
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:16,093
So this looks really good, good job.
