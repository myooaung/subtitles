00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.570
Now let's handle the case

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.170
where we try to get student information

3
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.370
for a student ID that doesn't exist.

4
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.130
We're going to check for the status code in the 400 series,

5
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.873
basically, a 404 for the student not found.

6
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.910
All righty, let's zoom in here.

7
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.660
Let's go ahead and write this test.

8
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.330
The first thing that we want to do

9
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.460
is try and find the student ID with the ID of zero.

10
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.303
This student ID doesn't exist.

11
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.130
So we'll do an assertFalse here to make sure

12
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.913
that this student is not present, doesn't exist.

13
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.170
And then I'll perform a get request

14
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.300
for student information for ID.

15
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.610
I pass the ID of zero.

16
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.263
That's the ID that doesn't exist.

17
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.963
And then I'll expect a 400 client error coming back.

18
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.140
And the REST API will also send back a JSON response

19
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.280
for the error message,

20
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.530
and we can use our jsonPath to verify the response.

21
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.240
And we use a similar technique that we used earlier

22
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.823
by checking the status and checking the message.

23
00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.250
All righty. So this coding here looks pretty good.

24
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.850
Let's go ahead and run the test.

25
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.500
And excellent. All green here.

26
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.470
So this test passed.

27
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.990
So we're able to verify the scenario

28
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.520
of trying to get to the information

29
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.660
for a student ID that doesn't exist.

30
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.493
Good job.
