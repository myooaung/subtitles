1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,463
Okay, so we're making

2
00:00:02,463 --> 00:00:03,840
some really good progress here,

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,040
let's go ahead and start writing some tests.

4
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:26,651
I'll add a new test here, "getstudentsHttpRequest."

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,180
I'll set up some sample objects that I can use here,

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,253
so I'll create a studentOne for Eric Roby,

7
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,610
and then I'll just do a quick copy paste here

8
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,223
for studentTwo, and then I'll just update for Darby.

9
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:29,710
And now let's go ahead and add these two objects

10
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,063
studentOne and studentTwo to a list.

11
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:06,150
And now I'd like to set up the mock here

12
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,229
for the studentAndGradeServiceMock.

13
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,900
So I'll say, "when,

14
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,850
studentAndGradeServiceMock.getGradebook."

15
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,443
then I simply want to return the collegeStudentList.

16
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,913
And let me fix a little typo I have here, "thenReturn."

17
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,280
And now just create a very simple assert here,

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,340
just making sure these two lists are the same

19
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,430
or these iterables are the same here.

20
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,000
So assertIterableEquals, I give collegeStudentList

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,030
and then I'll call this studentAndGradeServiceMock,

22
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,740
getGradebook, again, just a very basic test

23
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,573
just to make sure we have

24
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,913
some basic infrastructure in place right now.

25
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,750
Now, let me go ahead and run this test

26
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,040
and this test should run and should pass A-OK

27
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,390
because all we're doing is just playing around

28
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,340
with the mock object and comparing list,

29
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,350
so very simple, very straightforward.

30
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,310
We're not really doing anything with web yet,

31
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,910
we'll get into that in a second.

32
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,840
Now let's go ahead and move up to our controller,

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,170
our GradebookController, and I'll just set up

34
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,830
some preliminary work here in the GradebookController

35
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,760
to kind of set us up for some of the following videos.

36
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,130
So right now I'm in GradebookController,

37
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,110
I'ma expand my window here for a second,

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,890
I notice here that the code's not formatted properly,

39
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,873
let me just do a quick format here.

40
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,030
I know eventually I'll need the studentAndGradeService,

41
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,280
so let me go ahead and auto wire it right now.

42
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,329
I'll set up my collegeStudents here,

43
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,579
studentService.getGradebook

44
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:28,947
and then I'll add that as a model attribute.

45
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:48,070
All right, so this is pretty good,

46
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,860
again, just some preliminary setup work.

47
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,180
We'll get into more way up testing in a bit

48
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,360
but I at least wanted to kind of get this code in place

49
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,250
and then we'll make some more progress in the next video.

50
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,483
So hold tight and I'll see you in the next video.
