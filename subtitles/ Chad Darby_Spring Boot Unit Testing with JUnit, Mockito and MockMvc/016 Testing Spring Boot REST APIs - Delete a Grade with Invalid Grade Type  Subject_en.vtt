00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.610
Now let's cover one more case here of deleting a grade

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.150
for an invalid grade type or invalid subject.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.763
Again, we'll check for the 400 series of errors.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.743
Go ahead and start writing our test here,

5
00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:27.630
and we'll simply use our mockMvc

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.417
to perform a delete request to grades/{id}/{gradeType}.

7
00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:50.630
So we pass in the grade ID,

8
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.413
and then we'll pass an invalid grade type of literature.

9
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.990
And so of course, this should give us an error, right?

10
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.890
So we can go ahead and check for that.

11
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.520
And we can also use the techniques that we used before

12
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.613
of actually checking the JSON response.

13
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.920
Okay, so this coding here looks good.

14
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.520
Let's go ahead and run our test.

15
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.800
Excellent, and so this test passed,

16
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.050
so this looks really good.

17
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.360
Now, one thing I'd like to do is kind of move back over here

18
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.820
and run my full suite of tests

19
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.960
to make sure that all of my tests execute

20
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.003
and make sure that all of my tests pass.

21
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.870
And this is great.

22
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.130
We see all green, all green, all green.

23
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.200
So this is awesome.

24
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.260
So our tests pass, and we're in really good shape.

25
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.902
So I'd like to say good job, my friend.
