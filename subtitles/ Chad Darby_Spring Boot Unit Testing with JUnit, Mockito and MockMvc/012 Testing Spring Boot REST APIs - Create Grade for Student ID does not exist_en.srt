1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,980
Let's go ahead and create another test case

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,160
for the scenario of trying to create a grade

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,140
for a student ID that doesn't exist.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,970
And then we'll check for the status code in the 400 series.

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,283
Basically not found.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,250
All righty, let me zoom in here

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,900
and I start writing our new test.

8
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:26,309
And this is the test

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:29,259
for creating a valid grade, but the student does not exist.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,470
And what I'll do is I'll perform a post of that endpoint

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,723
for creating a grade.

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,710
I'll pass in those three parameters,

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,423
for grade, gradeType and studentId.

14
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,490
And now note here for student ID I'll pass

15
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,503
in the idea of zero, that student ID does not exist.

16
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,153
So we should get some type of error in this case.

17
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,740
So I'll expect a client error coming back in the 400 series.

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,100
And also that rest API will return a JSON response

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,853
with details on the error message.

20
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,830
And we can check the actual status and the message.

21
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,207
And we've seen similar coding like this before.

22
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:10,639
Okay, this looks good.

23
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go ahead and run this test.

24
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,440
And we see that this test passed a okay, so this is great.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,660
So we've covered the case here

26
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,270
of trying to create a grade for a student ID

27
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,580
that doesn't exist.

28
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,343
Good job my friend.
