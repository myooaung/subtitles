00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.240
All righty, so let's go ahead

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.560
and fix our failing test.

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.223
Let's go from red to green.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.010
I'll go ahead and move into my great book controller

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.110
and move into this student information method,

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.410
zoom in here for a second.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.440
And the first thing I want to do is check to see

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.000
if the student exists.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.730
If the student doesn't exist,

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.477
then I'd like to return "error."

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.510
All righty, so this will cover the case

12
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.543
of the invalid student ID.

13
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.810
I'd like to add another enhancement here

14
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.090
in this code before we move forward.

15
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.220
One is that I'd like to add the student information.

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.120
So I'd like to add the student entity to the model

17
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.050
and then I'd also like to add the averages

18
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.810
for the different subjects.

19
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.290
So I'd like to add the Math average, the Science average

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.120
and also the History average.

21
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.040
And I'd like to add those averages to the model.

22
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.243
So we'll go ahead and write some code for that here.

23
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.360
In this section of code,

24
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.883
we'll add the Math average to the model.

25
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.380
And for the case that we didn't have any Math grades,

26
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.283
then we'll simply say N/A, not applicable.

27
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.430
We'll do a similar thing here

28
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.113
for adding a Science average to the model.

29
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.220
And then finally, we'll wrap it up

30
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.463
by adding the History average to the model.

31
00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:36.640
Alrighty, so this code here looks pretty good.

32
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.593
Let's go ahead and run our test again.

33
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.170
And we see that our test passed.

34
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.200
That's really, really good.

35
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.370
So we've covered the case of if we have a valid student ID

36
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.620
we get the student information view.

37
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.980
If we have an invalid student ID, we get the error view.

38
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.430
So this is a all working and this is all in place.

39
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.263
Good job.
