In this video,

2
00:00:01.963 --> 00:00:05.250
we're going to write a MVC Test case for creating grade.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.000
We're going to test for creating a grade

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.793
when the subject is invalid.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.930
All right, so let's swing

6
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.470
into our grade book controller test.

7
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.370
And let me zoom in here for a second

8
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.520
and let's go ahead and write this new test.

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.760
This is the test where the grade type does not exist

10
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.063
or the actual subject is invalid.

11
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.750
I'll go ahead and perform the post request to /grades

12
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.480
and I'll pass in those three parameters

13
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.543
for grade, grade type, and student ID.

14
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.920
Now notice here the grade type literature,

15
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.680
so that's an invalid subject.

16
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.673
So this should give us an error.

17
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.080
Once I have the model in view

18
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.430
then I can insert the view name.

19
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.053
This should return error.

20
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.253
Now let's go ahead and run this test.

21
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.360
And excellent, so we see that this test passes.

22
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.960
So we covered the case already for trying to create a grade

23
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.540
with an invalid subject.

24
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.023
So I'd like to say good job.
