00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.540
Alrighty, so we're almost done.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.520
We have one last test case for deleting a grade.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.230
We're going to test for deleting a grade

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.163
when the subject is invalid.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.490
Let's move into our Gradebook Controller test and zoom in

6
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.840
and let's go ahead and start writing this test.

7
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.210
The first thing I want to do here is perform the HTTP request

8
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.463
to that given endpoint.

9
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.220
And one thing to notice here is that we passing in

10
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.400
the parameter for the great type,

11
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.100
and the grade type here is literature.

12
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.090
This is an invalid subject, right?

13
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.800
We only have math, science and history,

14
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.583
so this should give us an error.

15
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.120
I'll simply assert the view name here

16
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.620
and it should return error

17
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.770
because we passed it in an invalid subject.

18
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.380
Alrighty, let's go ahead and run this test

19
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.623
and check the results.

20
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.759
All right, green check marks, our test passed.

21
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.979
This covers the case of trying to a grade

22
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.720
with an invalid subject.

23
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.710
This is awesome.

24
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.523
I'd like to say good job and woohoo!

25
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.870
Sorry, I'm having too much fun here, too excited.
