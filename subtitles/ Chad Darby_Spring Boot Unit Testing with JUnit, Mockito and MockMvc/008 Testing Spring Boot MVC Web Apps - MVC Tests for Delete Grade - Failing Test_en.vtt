00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:01.923
In this video,

2
00:00:01.923 --> 00:00:04.923
we're going to cover deleting grades with MVC controller.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.460
Currently our application doesn't support deleting grades

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.030
via MVC controller,

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.240
so we'll apply TDD to add this functionality.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.760
What we'll do is we'll start by writing a failing test,

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.530
and then we'll actually implement the functionality

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.580
to make the test pass,

9
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.373
so we'll go from red to green.

10
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.690
Alrighty, let's get started.

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.720
I'll move into my grade book controller test

12
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.530
and I'll do some initial setup here.

13
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.340
The first thing I need to do is inject the mathGradesDao

14
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.540
because we'll use that later on in our test.

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.450
Now we'll move on down

16
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.900
and we'll actually start writing our actual test.

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.742
Let me zoom in here for a second.

18
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.830
What I'd like to do is actually retrieve the grade

19
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.370
from the database,

20
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.450
so I'll make use of the mathGradesDao.

21
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.410
And I'll say find by ID of one.

22
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.270
That's one of the grades that were set up initially

23
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.900
and our before each.

24
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.360
And then I'll make sure that this given great exist.

25
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.420
So I'll do an assert true here,

26
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.943
and I'll say mathGrade.isPresent.

27
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.893
Next I'll go ahead and perform the web request.

28
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.350
So this is for deleting the grade,

29
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.673
so I'll do a get on/grades/ID/grade type.

30
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.343
I'll perform the get request.

31
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.223
Alrighty, so now we can actually grab the model and view,

32
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.590
and then we can assert the view name.

33
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.960
So if everything was successful,

34
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.653
then it should return the page student information.

35
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.530
And then also we can confirm

36
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.980
that the grade was really deleted

37
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.660
by trying to retrieve it from the database

38
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.960
using that mathGradesDao.

39
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.280
Here I'll say mathGradesDao.findbyId of one,

40
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.680
and then I'll assert false,

41
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.963
making sure that this item was not present.

42
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.600
Okay, great, so that's just confirm

43
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.700
the grade was deleted.

44
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.800
Now this is a failing test, right?

45
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.970
Cause we haven't written any functionality,

46
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.320
but let's go ahead and run the test real quick.

47
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.970
As you can see the test fails

48
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.730
because we have not implemented the functionality

49
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.060
in the grade book controller for deleting.

50
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.020
And that's expected, right?

51
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.470
We're starting with the failing test

52
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.290
and then we'll write some code and make the test pass.

53
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.330
So we'll kind of go from red to green.

54
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.280
And we'll cover that in the next video.
