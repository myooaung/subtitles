00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,870
In this video we'll cover another MVC test

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,100
for deleting a grade.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,180
We'll create a test for deleting a grade

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,473
when the grade id is invalid.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,980
Okay, let's swing into our IDE and let's move in here

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,313
and let's go ahead and write this new test.

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,830
The first thing I'll do is I'll attempt to retrieve a grade

8
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,010
and what I'll do here is I'll make use of a grade id

9
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,560
that does not exist.

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,940
So in this scenario here,

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,103
the grade id of two does not exist.

12
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,459
And then I'll actually confirm the grade id doesn't exist

13
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,833
by doing an assertFalse.

14
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,360
Now I'll attempt to delete the grade via the HTTP request.

15
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,023
I do a get on grades, passing the id and the grade type.

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,080
And note here, I'm passing the id of two.

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,520
So this id does not exist.

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,423
So it's an invalid grade id.

19
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,780
I'll retrieve the model in view

20
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,453
and then I'll perform an assert on the view name.

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,600
And so I'm asserting here that the view name is error.

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,053
So it should be error.

23
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,880
Let me move to the top

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,730
and just fix a quick typo there, remove those two parens.

25
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,270
And now this coding here looks pretty good.

26
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,103
I'm happy with it.

27
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:38,223
So let's go ahead and run our test and check the results.

28
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:46,710
Excellent, this test passed.

29
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,780
This was really good.

30
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,190
So we covered the case for deleting a grade when

31
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,970
the grade id invalid or the grade id doesn't exist.

32
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,803
Good job.
