1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,023
All right.

2
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:03,340
So there's some additional setup code

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,700
that I want to do here for this test.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,983
And so we'll kind of walk through the steps here.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,260
One thing I'd like to do

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,760
is make use of the before all annotation

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,113
to do some initialization work on the mock servlet request.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,510
I'll create this method here called setup

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,790
and I need to create this mock servlet request.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,610
And I want to initialize it or populated

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,943
with some initial data.

12
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,993
I'll set the parameter for the first name.

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,723
I'll also set the parameter for the last name.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,053
And finally, I'll set the parameter for the email address.

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,400
Alrighty, let me swing this window open a bit

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,400
so you can see all of the code on one screen.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,050
Alrighty, this looks pretty good.

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,810
I'll just run this test real quick,

19
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,463
just to make sure everything still runs.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,850
Alrighty, green check marks.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,683
That's fine.

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,680
I want to set up a couple of more items here.

23
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:50,254
I want to go ahead and auto wire in, the mock MVC

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,850
and we'll use that later

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,900
and also auto wire, the object mapper

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,750
and we'll use the object mapper later

27
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,563
when we go through and do some of our rest API test.

28
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,763
So again, we're just doing some setup work here.

29
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,640
I also want to set up a variable here for the media type

30
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,780
and we'll use this application JSON constant

31
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,410
when we verify the actual JSON response.

32
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,690
So I'll just set this up as a constant here

33
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,743
and I'll set it to media type .application_JSON.

34
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,500
So be sure to choose the one that I have selected here

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,333
on the screen.

36
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,000
And again, we'll use this later

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,133
when we actually start writing some of our test.

38
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,643
Alrighty.

39
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,910
So all of our coding's in place here

40
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,460
for this great book controller test,

41
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,570
as far as the initial coding,

42
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,270
I'll run this test one more time

43
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,970
just to make sure everything runs through successfully

44
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,340
and everything does.

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,550
And then the following videos,

46
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,160
we'll actually start getting down and dirty

47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,330
and we'll actually start writing

48
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,360
the actual implementation test for this example.

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,370
So at the moment, I'll go ahead

50
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,890
and grab this place holder test.

51
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,200
We don't need it anymore.

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,940
And I'll go ahead and remove it

53
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,900
from the test because it doesn't do much.

54
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,530
We'll actually add some real code

55
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,623
for it in the next set of videos.

56
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,843
All righty.

57
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:47,676
So at the moment we have everything

58
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:48,860
kind of set up and we're ready to go

59
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,430
and we're ready to start doing some real work.

60
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,400
So this is great and I'll see you.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,973
And the next video.
