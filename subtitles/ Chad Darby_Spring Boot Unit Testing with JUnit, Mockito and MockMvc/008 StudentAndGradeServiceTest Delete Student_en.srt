1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,273
Alrighty, so we're making

2
00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:03,430
some good progress here.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,393
Let's go through and add another test.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,030
And this test will be for deleting a student

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,053
using the service.

6
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:21,700
What I like to do is first retrieve a given student

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,340
from the database.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,500
Then I'd like to delete that student

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,190
and then perform a test to make sure that I actually

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,383
deleted that student.

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,360
First, I'll start off by grabbing a student

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,123
using StudentDao.findById of one.

13
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,330
And then just making sure that this given student is present

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,380
meaning that we found them during the first call.

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,820
So we know we have the student at this point,

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,270
we retrieved an actual student from the database.

17
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,290
Then I'll make use of the studentService.delete,

18
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:17,073
and I pass in the given ID.

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,540
And once I've delete student from the service,

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,830
then I'd like to attempt to retrieve the student again

21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,020
and then check to see their results.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,923
I'll make use of the studentDao.findById.

23
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,310
And then I'll assert false

24
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,400
and make sure that they're not present

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,510
or make sure it's empty.

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,120
So here I'll say deletedCollegeStudent.isPresent.

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,663
That should turn false.

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,970
Now we have some problems here, when we run it,

29
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,410
we'll actually get an error because we have a method

30
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,050
that's not defined in the service.

31
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,910
So this deleteStudent method is not defined in the service.

32
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,660
Let's go ahead and create that now.

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,509
I'll simply move into my service and write this new method,

34
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,873
deleteStudent, pass in an ID.

35
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,620
I perform a quick check

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,390
and then I'll say studentDao.deleteById,

37
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:40,823
and I pass in the ID.

38
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,123
All right, this looks pretty good.

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,170
Now we can swing back to our test

40
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,810
and now we can run our test

41
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,883
and hopefully our test will pass.

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,830
Excellent, our test passed as desired.

43
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,550
So we retrieved the student, we made sure we had them.

44
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,230
We deleted the student and then we also did another test

45
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,110
to make sure that the student really was deleted.

46
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,980
So, this works out as planned, I like it.

47
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,913
Good job.
