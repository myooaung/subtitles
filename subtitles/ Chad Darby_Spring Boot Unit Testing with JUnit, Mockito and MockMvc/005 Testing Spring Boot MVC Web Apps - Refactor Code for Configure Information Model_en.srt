1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,714
Let's clean up the ugly copy paste code

2
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:05,930
from the previous video.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,100
Okay. Remember I said we had some ugly code

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,580
and we'd actually clean it up and

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,980
now's the time to do that.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,940
What we'll do is we'll refactor the code

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,390
for student information.

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,590
We'll move the configuration of model attributes

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,413
for student information to the service class.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,470
Let's move into our student in grade service.

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,750
This is where we're going to place

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,350
the new refactored code.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,930
What I'll do right now is I'll simply set

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,883
up a stub method right now.

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,500
I'll call it configure student information model.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,620
I'll have an ID

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,993
and the actual model.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,740
Right now, this code is empty.

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,790
We'll actually add code here in a second.

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,190
Now let's move over to our grade book controller

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,129
and let's grab this section of code

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,563
that we did the copy paste on earlier.

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,470
And let's go ahead and cut this code.

24
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,670
Now, moving back over to student in grade service,

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,963
then we'll actually paste in that code.

26
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,500
And up top here for a student service

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,800
dot student information,

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,380
we'll simply remove that.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,340
We'll simply have it as student information

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,560
and we pass in the ID.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
But this is effectively

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,640
the refactored code that we grabbed from our controller

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,940
and we put into this student in grade service.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,153
Now let's move back

35
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:52,483
to our controller and let's call this method.

36
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,010
Here I'll say student service dot configure student

37
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,410
information model.

38
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,133
I pass in the ID and I pass in the model.

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,210
All righty, this looks really good.

40
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,060
So we simply refactor the code.

41
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,960
We grab that code.

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,440
We put into a method and the service, and then

43
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,300
we're simply calling that service method

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,480
from the controller.

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,313
Excellent.

46
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,000
Now let's scroll up a bit and there's another

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,484
section of code that we did the copy paste on

48
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,450
in the previous video.

49
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,821
Here, we want to actually remove it and then make use

50
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:31,840
of that method that we just created.

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,660
Here's the section of code we're in grade book

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,810
controller right now.

53
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,560
Let's go ahead and delete this code

54
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,120
and let's call that method in a service

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,513
that we just created.

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Student service dot configure student information model.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,593
We pass in the ID and the model.

58
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,750
Okay, this looks really good.

59
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,900
Now you see how we've cleaned up the coding.

60
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,270
Previously, we had those copy paste examples

61
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,630
that was pretty ugly.

62
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,540
We kind of refactored that code, put it into the service.

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,200
And now the controller is simply making that call.

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,180
This is much better, much cleaner.

65
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,980
And uh, I like it because what we had

66
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,543
before was pretty ugly.

67
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,320
Now as a sanity check

68
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
I want to go through it and run all of my tests and

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
make sure everything still runs.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,350
I want to make sure that I didn't break anything.

71
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,820
Oh yeah.

72
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,370
All I see are green check marks.

73
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,380
That means that all of our tests have passed.

74
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,020
So, we didn't break anything.

75
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,070
We refactored our code, we cleaned it

76
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,909
up and now everything is still working.

77
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,060
That's awesome.

78
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,993
I'm really happy.
