1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,173
Alrighty.

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:04,770
So in preparation of connecting to the MySQL database,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,653
let's go ahead and set up a separate properties file.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,300
And this will mainly just be a copy paste exercise

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,453
on our existing properties file.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,383
Let's go ahead

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,120
and do a quick copy paste here on application.properties

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,570
and we'll have a properties file specifically for testing.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,643
So I'll call this one, application-test.properties.

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,300
Okay. So here's my application test properties, it has all

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,100
of our test work that we did previously.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,400
And I want to update my test to use this application

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,683
test properties.

14
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,910
Let's go ahead and move over to our source test

15
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,470
and open up our Grade Book Controller test

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,093
and we'll modify it to use application-test.properties.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,760
I'll move down here to my test property source

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,060
and I give the name application test property.

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,250
So it's pointing to the name

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,113
of that file that we just created.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,980
And of course, I need to do a similar thing

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,243
in our Student And Grade Service test.

23
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,110
Again, moving down to my test property source,

24
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,913
I make use of application test properties.

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,380
Excellent. This looks pretty good.

26
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,213
Now let's go ahead

27
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:45,070
and run our test to make sure we didn't break anything

28
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,283
and make sure it's using our properties file.

29
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,650
Alrighty. The test passed, all green check marks.

30
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,670
That's excellent.

31
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,140
And let's go ahead and run our full test suite

32
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,540
and let's make sure all of our tests still pass.

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,770
And this looks really good.

34
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,300
I see a lot of green check marks here.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,133
So this is great.

36
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,530
So all the tests passed.

37
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,363
This is awesome.

38
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:19,196
I like it.

39
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,800
So that was just a quick little update here just to move all

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,816
of our test props into a separate file

41
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:28,210
and then we can use application.properties

42
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,190
for our real database connection, communication work

43
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,390
and we'll cover that part in the next video.
