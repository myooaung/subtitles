1
00:00:00,713 --> 00:00:02,920
All right, so let's cover another scenario.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,570
Let's try and to delete a grade

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,860
for a grade ID that doesn't exist.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,190
And we'll check for the HP status codes in the 400 series.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,603
Basically, not found.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,329
I'll zoom in here and I'll start writing this test.

7
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,680
And what I'll do is I'll use the mock MVC to perform

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,773
a delete request to grades ID slash grade type.

9
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,930
And I'll pass in values here of two comma history.

10
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,420
Two refers to the grade ID and that's the grade ID

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,483
that does not exist, so this should give us an error.

12
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,050
So we'll just check the status here to make sure

13
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,143
it's a 400 series client error.

14
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,949
And then we get this JSON response

15
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:19,300
from the rest API and we can go through and check

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,650
the status and the message.

17
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,630
Okay So this coding here looks good,

18
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,253
lets go ahead and run our test.

19
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,029
So we see all green here, that means

20
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,740
the test passed and we're in good shape.

21
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,993
So good job.
