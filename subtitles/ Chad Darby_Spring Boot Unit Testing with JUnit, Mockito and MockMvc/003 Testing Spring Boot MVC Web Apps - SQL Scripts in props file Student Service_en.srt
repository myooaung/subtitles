1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,060
And we're making some really

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,040
good progress here.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,450
In this video we'll cover step two

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,520
of injecting the SQL into our test

5
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,333
using the value annotation.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,630
Let's swing over to our code

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,723
for our student and grade service test,

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,910
and we'll make use of the value annotation

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,393
to inject those values.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,623
We reference the actual name of the property,

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,283
and we'll assign it to a string SQLaddstudent.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,700
And then we simply repeat the process

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,263
for the other fields here.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,420
So I'll kind of go on quiet time right now

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,310
and just crank out this code,

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,760
so just follow along with me.

17
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,570
Okay, I'm back.

18
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,680
Alrighty, so this all looks really good.

19
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,300
So we have the code in place for injecting the SQL

20
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,173
from the properties file into our test.
