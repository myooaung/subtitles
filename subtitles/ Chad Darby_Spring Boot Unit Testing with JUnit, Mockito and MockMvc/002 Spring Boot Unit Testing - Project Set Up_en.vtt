00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.330
Okay, so in our IDE

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.793
let's go ahead and open up our project.

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.130
And we have a new project that we'll start with,

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.210
it's in the directory

5
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.210
spring-boot-unit-testing-main/2.00-starting-project.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.603
So this is the 2.00-starting-project directory.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.800
Let's move into here

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.550
and let's go ahead and select open.

9
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.180
So just a quick tour of the existing code

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.180
that was created by that previous employee.

11
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.780
So there are some models that will make use of here.

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.320
There's the Student interface,

13
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.233
I just has two basic methods here,

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.493
and there's a CollegeStudent class.

15
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.433
So this CollegeStudent implements Student,

16
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.640
define some field, some constructors,

17
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.840
all the Getter and Setters,

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.650
we override the two string method

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.230
and we also provide implementations

20
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.470
so that student interface.

21
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.010
So the method studentInformation

22
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.563
and also get full name.

23
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.693
We also have another class here called StudentGrades.

24
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.120
So it'll have a list of grades,

25
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.010
in this case math grades.

26
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.510
We'll add more subjects in the future

27
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.343
but for right now,

28
00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:30.143
we'll just make use of math grades here.

29
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.160
And then we have our main SpringBootApplication

30
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.460
and kind of expand the window here for a second.

31
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.960
So just a regular SpringBootApplication.

32
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.490
We have a standard main that we always get for free.

33
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.920
And then here the previous employee

34
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.813
decided to manually define Beans for collegeStudent,

35
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.183
and they set the Bean name and the Scope.

36
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.460
And then also there's an application.properties file,

37
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.380
and we'll actually retrieve these properties

38
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.823
in our SpringBoot test.

39
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.740
All right, so that's it

40
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.250
as far as the code,

41
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.500
really small code base here

42
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.360
and we'll spend the remaining time

43
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.353
on building out unit us for this code base.
