1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,870
We've made good progress so far

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,070
with student information.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,610
I want to add one more test.

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,420
And this is for testing for a student ID

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,933
that doesn't exist.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,120
Alrighty. So we're in our IDE.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,303
And I'll add a new test for this scenario.

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,463
This is for the test

9
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:35,610
of StudentInformationServiceReturnNull

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,453
for a student that doesn't exist.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,140
I use my student service

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,470
and attempt to get information

13
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,363
for a student that doesn't exist.

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,880
I'll pass in a student ID of zero

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,150
so this ID doesn't exist,

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,053
so this method should return null.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,680
Here I'll make the assertion of assertNull

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,080
on gradebookCollegueStudent.

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,430
Now let's go ahead and run this test.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,950
And we see that the test fails.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,800
So it has the error

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,870
of NoSuchElementException: No value present.

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,950
So there's some additional code that we need to do

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,320
to make sure that it returns null

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,653
for this given scenario.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,470
Let's go ahead and move into our student and grade service.

27
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,010
And right at the beginning here,

28
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,120
I want to perform a check.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,360
So I want to check if the student doesn't exist,

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,513
then return null.

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,443
I pass in that student ID.

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,223
And here I have return null.

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,990
Alrighty, this code looks pretty good.

34
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,890
Let's go ahead and run our test again.

35
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,810
And the test passed a success.

36
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,560
This is really, really good.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,940
Now we've covered that case

38
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,780
of trying to retrieve student information

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,340
for a student that doesn't exist.

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,370
In this case our code returns null, as desired.

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,293
Good job.
