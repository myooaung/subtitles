00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome to the course

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.993
on Spring Boot Unit Testing.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.540
Let's meet our course development team.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.260
First, we have Eric Roby.

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.720
He has a website called Coding with Roby.

6
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.500
You can visit his website at ericjroby.com.

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.620
Eric has created a number of popular Python courses.

8
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.950
We've known each other for the past couple of years

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.180
and decided to collaborate

10
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.190
on this Spring Boot Unit Testing course.

11
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.610
And that's me, Chad Darby.

12
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.180
I've created a number of popular Java courses.

13
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.203
I love creating courses and I luv2code.

14
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.030
Spring Boot supports developing unit tests

15
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.760
and integration tests by making use of JUnit and Mockito.

16
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.995
By developing tests, we can create applications

17
00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:48.170
with better code design,

18
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.570
fewer bugs and also higher reliability.

19
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810
In this course, we're going to show you how to take advantage

20
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.723
of Spring Boot's testing support.

21
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.820
Now, let's take a look at our course roadmap.

22
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.050
So we'll start off with just a quick review of JUnit

23
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.030
and then we'll move into the Spring Boot section

24
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.260
of mocks with Mockito.

25
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.570
Next, we'll cover Spring Boot testing, Spring MVC,

26
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.030
web apps and then finally with Spring Boot,

27
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.633
we'll cover testing Spring REST APIs.

28
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.160
Now, in terms of prerequisites,

29
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.710
you should have prior experience with Java,

30
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.010
Spring Boot and also Maven.

31
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.900
So I assume that you already know these technologies.

32
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.770
If you've taken some of my previous courses

33
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.860
like the Spring and Hibernate for Beginners,

34
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.750
then that'll give you enough information

35
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.420
for this particular course.

36
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.610
If you have not taken

37
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.360
the Spring and Hibernate for Beginners course,

38
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.610
you'll need to learn these technologies first.

39
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.270
You can go online and search for a number of free tutorials,

40
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.980
but you need to know this information

41
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.023
before you can proceed with this course.

42
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.710
Regarding development environment,

43
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.080
you should have these development tools installed,

44
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.070
IntelliJ or Eclipse or your favorite IDE.

45
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.650
Now, in this course, we'll make use of IntelliJ,

46
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.580
the free version, but everything will work

47
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.440
with other IDEs, such as eclipse, NetBeans and so on.

48
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.490
All you need is basic Maven support for your IDE,

49
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.760
so feel free to use any development tool that you want to.

50
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.360
All you need is Maven support and you're good to go.

51
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.150
And later on in the course,

52
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.400
we'll make use of a database.

53
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.200
We'll make use of the MySQL database,

54
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.640
so make sure you have that installed

55
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.673
along with the MySQL Workbench.

56
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.560
In terms of source code and PDFs,

57
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.800
all source code is available for download

58
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.748
and also all the PDFs of the slides

59
00:02:37.748 --> 00:02:40.460
are also available for download.

60
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.450
In the next lecture, I'll give you the links

61
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.683
to actually download those resources.

62
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.190
And also, if you have any questions

63
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.090
or need help as you go through the course,

64
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.920
simply post your question in the classroom discussion forum

65
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.020
and we'll get back to you shortly.

66
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.500
Okay, that's it for now.

67
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.853
I'll see you in the next video.
