00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.390
Let's update our test

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.540
for deleting students and grades.

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.490
Currently in our test, we delete a student.

4
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.800
However we don't delete the associated grades

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.633
for the students.

6
00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:11.510
So let's go ahead and make those modifications

7
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.893
to our test now and also to our code.

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.733
All righty.

9
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.566
So I'm moving in here

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.180
into my student and grade service test,

11
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.160
and let's move to this method here.

12
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.700
Delete student service.

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.830
Okay, there it is.

14
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.160
Excellent, now we actually delete the student,

15
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.770
but we don't delete the grades.

16
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.050
So here we're going to add some code

17
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.480
to delete the supporting grades for that given student.

18
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.930
And I'll simply walk through the process

19
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.210
of performing a delete for the math grade,

20
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.303
the science grade and the history grade.

21
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.470
All righty, so we have the grades,

22
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.680
and then we go through and we check to see

23
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.653
If each one of the grades are present.

24
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.463
Basically making sure

25
00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:44.060
that we could retrieve those grades from the database.

26
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.503
And then we make use

27
00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:58.600
of the student service dot delete student,

28
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.700
and it'll do its work.

29
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.040
And then finally we'll want to verify

30
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.640
that we actually deleted those grades.

31
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.640
So we'll attempt to retrieve those grades again

32
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.120
from the database and then make

33
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.420
our appropriate assertions here at the bottom.

34
00:02:39.883 --> 00:02:41.370
And here at the bottom, we're asserting falls

35
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.570
to make sure the math grade was deleted, the science grade

36
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.570
and similar thing for the history grade.

37
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.233
All righty.

38
00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:02.070
So this is our coding so far,

39
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.360
and this is actually a failing test.

40
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.872
But let's go ahead and run it

41
00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:05.705
and verify that.

42
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.380
This test fails as expected, right?

43
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.810
Because at the moment we don't have any real code

44
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.643
in the back end

45
00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:23.330
for actually deleting the supporting grades for a student.

46
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.700
We need to update our student grade service test

47
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.533
to cover that.

48
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.990
We have our failing tests.

49
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.780
Now let's go ahead and do the work and make the test pass.

50
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.643
We want to go from red to green.

51
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.270
Let's move over to our student and grade service

52
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.513
and let's do the work.

53
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.860
I'll move here inside of this method here,

54
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.090
delete student.

55
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.923
Currently at the moment,

56
00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:46.490
we're only deleting a student.

57
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.323
We need to go through,

58
00:03:47.323 --> 00:03:48.990
and also delete the appropriate grades.

59
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.640
Here I'll say math grade.

60
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.570
DAO dot delete by student ID.

61
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.003
And I pass in that ID.

62
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.270
And at the moment it's red,

63
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.350
because we don't have that functionality, but no problems.

64
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.940
We'll add it in a second.

65
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.010
And let's do a similar thing here

66
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.700
for the science grade DAO

67
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.633
and also the history grade DAO.

68
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.210
Now let's go ahead and fix these issues here

69
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.043
with the DAOs.

70
00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:35.013
We need to add some custom finder methods to those DAOs.

71
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.860
I'll move over to the repository package,

72
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.810
and I'll open up the history grade DAO.

73
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.830
I'll add this custom finder method.

74
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.383
Delete by student ID.

75
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.600
Okay, so this looks really good.

76
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.540
Let's go ahead and swing over

77
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.223
to our math grade DAO and do a similar thing.

78
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.693
Delete by student ID.

79
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.480
And then finally, let's go ahead,

80
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.580
and wrap it up with our science grades DAO.

81
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.823
Third times a charm.

82
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.660
We'll add this delete by student ID.

83
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.253
All righty.

84
00:05:45.253 --> 00:05:46.210
So this looks really good.

85
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.043
I like it.

86
00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:48.590
I like it so far

87
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.330
And this should resolve the syntax areas that we had

88
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.650
in our student and grade service dot java.

89
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.813
So all of those red items are now resolved.

90
00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.050
Let's go ahead and run our test

91
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.000
and see how this test works out for us.

92
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.320
And excellent.

93
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.710
We see that the test passes.

94
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.543
So this is great.

95
00:06:08.543 --> 00:06:10.240
So we're deleting the student

96
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.650
and also deleting the associated grades,

97
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.690
which is really good.

98
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.210
And then finally, as a sanity test,

99
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.470
let's just go ahead and run all of our tests.

100
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.100
Just to make sure we didn't break anything

101
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.373
during the process.

102
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.390
And we're getting all green check marks here.

103
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.740
That means everything still passes.

104
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.510
So a nice level of comfort

105
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.490
that things are looking pretty good.

106
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.653
So I'd like to say good job, my friend.
