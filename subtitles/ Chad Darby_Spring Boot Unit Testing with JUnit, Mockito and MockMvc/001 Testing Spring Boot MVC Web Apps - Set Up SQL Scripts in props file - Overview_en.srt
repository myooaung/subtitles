1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,360
In this video will set up the SQL scripts

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,663
and properties files.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,250
Now, currently in our application the SQL

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,880
for the sample data is hard-coded in our tests.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,222
And we like to move the SQL to our properties file.

6
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,010
Now let's look at the code that we currently have

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,780
using the BeforeEach and AfterEach and the BeforeEach

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,490
we have the SQL for inserting sample data

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,100
and the AfterEach we have the code

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,350
for deleting sample data, but this is all hard-coded SQL.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,940
I'd like to take this, remove it

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,863
from the code and put it into a properties file.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,760
Here's our development process.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,690
The first thing that we'll do is we'll add the SQL

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,320
to the application.properties.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,640
Then we'll inject the SQL into our test

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,640
using the value annotation.

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,890
Finally we'll refactor the BeforeEach

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,843
and AfterEach methods to make use of the properties.

20
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,813
Now let's take a look

21
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:04,220
at step one of adding the SQL to application.properties.

22
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,960
We'll take that SQL that we currently

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,560
have in our test class

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,240
and we'll move this over to an application.properties file.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,160
At the moment here, I have an example

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,723
for creating student and also deleting the student.

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,430
Then in step two, we're going to inject the SQL

28
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,610
into the test using the value annotation.

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,620
Here's my coding here for my test.

30
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,460
And then notice here

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,350
I have value and I give the name

32
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,170
of the actual property that I'm going to inject.

33
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,700
Here we have sql.script.create.student

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,370
refers to the actual property

35
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,380
from the application.properties file

36
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,880
and a similar thing here for deleting the student.

37
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,970
Now in step three, we can refactor

38
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,002
the BeforeEach and AfterEach annotations, these methods here

39
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:51,270
and the BeforeEach, we can simply make use

40
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,340
of that string jdbc execute SQL add student

41
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,040
and a similar thing for AfterEach,

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,550
jdbc execute SQL delete student.

43
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,690
So this looks pretty good.

44
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,270
We've accomplished the goal of removing the hard-coded SQL

45
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,100
from our Java code and putting it into our properties file.

46
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,169
Alrighty, let's go ahead and swing

47
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,870
into the next video and let's write the code for this.
