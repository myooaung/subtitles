1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,860
Let's start with our development process.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,230
So in this video, we'll cover step one

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,853
of adding the Maven Dependencies for JUnit.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,330
And before we get started,

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,640
let's go ahead and download some starter code

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,990
for this given project.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,710
So visit the link that I have here on the slide

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,633
and it'll download a zip file to your computer.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,680
Let me swing over to my file system here

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,933
and move into my downloads directory.

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,530
And so here's the file that was downloaded,

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,903
spring-boot-unit-testing-main.zip.

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,613
Let's go ahead and unzip this file.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,920
And now let's go ahead and copy this folder

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,913
to anywhere in your file system.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,520
I'll just move it over here

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,489
and I'll just drop it into this luv2code directory

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,340
but you can put it anywhere you want on your file system.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,910
And if we move into this directory,

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,830
we'll see that there's a number of projects out here,

21
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,290
and the one that we're going to use for this video series

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,730
is we'll start with the 1.0 starting project.

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,530
So that's the one that we're going to use for this example.

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,020
So let's go ahead and start up our IDE,

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,773
and then we'll open up that project or import it.

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,820
And I'll simply open a project that's located

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,290
in spring-boot-unit-testing-main,

28
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,103
the 1.0.0 starting project.

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,793
Move into that directory and select open.

30
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,900
It may prompt you if you want to add the files to Git,

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,723
and you can say don't ask again.

32
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,790
And there may be some other prompts,

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,763
just kind of work through them accordingly.

34
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,300
All righty, so the first thing we need to do here

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,910
is add the Maven Dependency for JUnit.

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,453
So I'll go ahead and open up my pom.xml file.

37
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,490
So I'll make use of the IDE

38
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,490
to help me with this given dependency.

39
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,180
So the IDE can actually find the appropriate dependency

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,540
that I need and actually insert it into my pom file.

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,423
So I'll go to this menu option here,

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,193
hold generate, then I'll choose dependency.

43
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,570
And then I'll type in the dependency that I need.

44
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,773
So I need the junit-jupiter dependency.

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,390
They'll give me a list of options here

46
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,270
and I'll choose the one that's called junit-jupiter

47
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,693
and choose whatever version that they have here.

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,180
And your version numbers may be slightly different,

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,980
just choose the appropriate version.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,233
All righty.

51
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,210
So let's take a look at our pom.xml, and great.

52
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,840
So they added some new entries here,

53
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,133
so a new dependency section with the given dependency.

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,330
I'm going to go ahead and move it down below properties.

55
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,680
Just kind of the way I like to line up my file

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,960
to structure it.

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,793
You could do it either way

58
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:46,310
but I like to have dependencies here at the bottom.

59
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,160
And so there's the dependency here

60
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,130
for junit-jupiter with the appropriate version.

61
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,980
So this is great.

62
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,610
Now I'd also like to add the scope here.

63
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,913
So I like to set scope for test.

64
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,780
And remember with test scope,

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,110
the dependency is only for test purposes.

66
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,510
The dependency is not required for normal execution

67
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,920
of the application.

68
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,963
So I set the scope here for test.

69
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,150
All righty, so this looks pretty good so far.
