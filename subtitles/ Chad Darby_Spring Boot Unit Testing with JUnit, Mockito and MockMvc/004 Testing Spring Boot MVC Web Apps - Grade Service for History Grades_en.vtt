00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.610
Okay. So thanks for hanging in here with me.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.110
We have just one more to go for History grades.

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.460
Let's go ahead and dive in.

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.450
And this one you can really do on autopilot

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.570
because we've already done the work for Math and Science

6
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.309
and I'll just sit back. I won't say much.

7
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.630
And I'll let you work through this one.

8
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.863
Follow along with getting this set up for History grade.

9
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.507
All right. I'm back.

10
00:05:01.507 --> 00:05:04.880
Hopefully you enjoyed the quiet time there

11
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.370
with developing the code for the History grade.

12
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.560
Now we're in good shape here

13
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.413
and let's go ahead and run the test.

14
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.190
And this test passes successfully as expected, right?

15
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.960
And we can even see the SQL logs

16
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.560
where we have the inserts into Math grade,

17
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.140
Science grade and also History grade.

18
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.893
So I'd like to say job well done my friend.
