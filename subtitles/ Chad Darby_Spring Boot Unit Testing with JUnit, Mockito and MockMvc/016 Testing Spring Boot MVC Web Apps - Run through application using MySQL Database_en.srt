1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,003
One thing that we need to do

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,070
is we need to create the database schema here

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,300
for this example, mysqltutorial,

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,230
and we do that using an SQL script.

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,290
So let's go ahead and move over to MySQL Workbench

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,493
and let's kind of get started with that part of it.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,480
Alrighty, so I'm in MySQL Workbench,

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,560
let's go ahead and connect,

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,260
be sure to use the root password for your environment.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,770
And now, once you're logged in,

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,810
you'll see over on the left-hand side, the SCHEMAS.

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,403
We need a new schema here for mysqltutorial.

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,570
I can create this schema by using an SQL script,

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,770
and we provide this in our course directory.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,710
Simply move into your Spring Boot Unit Testing directory.

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,813
And there's a file here called Create mySQL database script.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,460
And it's just a very basic SQL file.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,350
It's simply a dump of a database.

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,483
It creates the tables and it also inserts some sample data.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,840
Now in your toolbar,

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,300
go ahead and click the yellow lightning bolt here

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,493
to actually execute this SQL script.

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,820
Great, so that's complete.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,360
Now move over to the left-hand side

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,690
and just do a refresh in your SCHEMAS,

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,590
and you should see a new schema, mySQLtutorial,

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,160
and it has four tables for history_grade,

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,270
math_grade, science_grade and student.

29
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,840
The SQL script actually populated some sample data

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,830
into these tables

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,283
and we can go through and view this data now.

32
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,690
So I'll take a look at my students.

33
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,490
We have five students at the moment.

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,793
There we have some science grades, math grades,

35
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,913
and also some history grades.

36
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,040
Now let's go ahead and run our application.

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,560
Our app is up and running, and we see at the homepage

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,670
we have those five students already prepopulated,

39
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,720
which is really good.

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,210
We can move in here and add a new science grade

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,943
for a student, David Adams,

42
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,160
Submit, and then we can swing back over

43
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,440
to the MySQL Workbench, and we can view the science grades.

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,100
I'll click on the tab for science grades

45
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,780
and I'll run this SQL query again,

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,670
to kind of refresh the results.

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,133
And we see we have a new entry here for 100.00.

48
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,250
I can also delete the grade of 80 for that student,

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,270
swing back over here and do the query,

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,513
and the grade of 80 has been removed.

51
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,480
The nice thing here is that we're actually confirming

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,270
that we are saving data in MySQL and so forth.

53
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,360
So we know that our app is really connected

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
to the MySQL database at this time.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,010
And we can play around with some other features

56
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,360
of the application and so forth,

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,100
but we have a connection to MySQL database

58
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,570
and we're storing and retrieving data from the database.

59
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,333
So I'd like to say, good job, my friend.
