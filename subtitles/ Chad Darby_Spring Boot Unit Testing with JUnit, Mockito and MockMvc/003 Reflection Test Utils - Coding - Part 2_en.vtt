00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.363
Up top we'll add our normal

2
00:00:02.363 --> 00:00:04.393
spring boot test annotation.

3
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.050
And we'll go through and we'll add some supporting fields

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.993
that we'll use later on for our test.

5
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880
We'll also add a BeforeEach method

6
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.713
to add some initializations for this student object.

7
00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:43.460
And then we'll actually set some

8
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.140
of the private fields directly.

9
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.340
Now we could set 'em using those normal set methods

10
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.220
or whatever, but we're going to just demonstrate how

11
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.920
we can set those fields directly.

12
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.370
And these are private fields.

13
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.313
So we set the field for ID to a given value,

14
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:40.640
and also set the field for student grades to a given value.

15
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.870
And again, we're simply just setting these directly

16
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.090
on those private fields.

17
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.490
We're not using their appropriate setup methods.

18
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.900
Okay so this coding looks pretty good

19
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.463
for that BeforeEach method.
