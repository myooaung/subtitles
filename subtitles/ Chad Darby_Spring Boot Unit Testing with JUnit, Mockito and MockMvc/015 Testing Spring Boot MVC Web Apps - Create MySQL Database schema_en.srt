1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,966
Okay, so let's go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:02,966 --> 00:00:04,059
In this video, we're going to configure

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,610
the JDBC connection properties

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,453
for the MySQL database.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,320
This video assumes that you have already installed

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,620
the MySQL database server and also the MySQL Workbench.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,080
If you haven't installed those items,

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,450
please install those items now

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,800
and then come back and continue with the video.

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,020
All righty, let's go ahead and dive in.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,923
The first thing we want to do

12
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:32,280
is edit our application.properties file.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,270
Let's remove all of this test information.

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,103
We don't need that.

15
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:37,680
This is for our main application.

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,460
So remove all the test stuff,

17
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,810
and we're going to add in the actual

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,693
JDBC connection properties here for our database.

19
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,860
We'll set up the driver class name

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,993
to make use of the MySQL database driver.

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,383
We'll also set up the datasource URL.

22
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,090
I'll set up the datasource username

23
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,100
and the datasource password.

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,596
Now this area will vary depending on the configurations

25
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:22,860
you set up with your database.

26
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,860
You may have a different root password.

27
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,650
So be sure to set that accordingly.

28
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,500
Or you may have a different user account

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,760
you want to use other than root.

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,459
So again, username and password,

31
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,200
you'll need to set that up accordingly

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,083
based on your own configurations.

33
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:49,561
I set the initialization mode to always.

34
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,093
And I set the ddl-auto to update.

35
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,500
Okay, this configuration looks really good.

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,333
I like it.
