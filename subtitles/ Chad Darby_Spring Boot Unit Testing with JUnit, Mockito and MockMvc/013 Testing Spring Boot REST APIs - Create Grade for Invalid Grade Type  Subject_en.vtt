00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.983
Now let's move in here.

2
00:00:01.983 --> 00:00:03.100
Let's cover another case.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.850
Let's cover the case with trying to create a grade

4
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.370
for an invalid grade type or subject.

5
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.423
In this case, we should get a 400 error.

6
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.410
All right, let's zoom in here

7
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.460
and start writing the code for this test.

8
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:24.260
So we're trying to create a grade

9
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.480
for a grade type that does not exist,

10
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.053
so an invalid subject.

11
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.630
We'll perform a post over here to the grades,

12
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.970
and then we'll pass in those three parameters

13
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.353
for grade, grade type and student ID.

14
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.620
And notice here for the grade type,

15
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.210
I'm passing in literature.

16
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.740
This grade type doesn't exist.

17
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.750
We only have Math, Science, and History.

18
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.350
So this should give us an error.

19
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.480
Then we pass in a valid student ID of one.

20
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.313
That's okay.

21
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.430
So the main problem here is actually on the grade type.

22
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.680
Now I'm checking the status here.

23
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.370
We should have an error.

24
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.770
And then we can also inspect the contents

25
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.403
of that JSON response and verify it accordingly.

26
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.243
All righty.

27
00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:08.076
So that's it for the coding here.

28
00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:09.220
Let's go and run this test

29
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.820
and let's check out the results.

30
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.810
And all green here,

31
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.850
so this looks really good.

32
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.810
So this test passed, so awesome!

33
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.700
We covered the test case of trying to create a grade

34
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.850
for a grade type that doesn't exist.

35
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.683
Good job!
