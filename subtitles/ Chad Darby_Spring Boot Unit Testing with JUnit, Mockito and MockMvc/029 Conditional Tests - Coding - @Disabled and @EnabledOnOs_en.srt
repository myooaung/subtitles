1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
All right,

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,690
let's go ahead and move into our IDE.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,173
In this video, we'll cover @Disabled and also @EnabledOnOs.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,730
And in this example, I'll actually create a new test class.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,970
So I'll move under test,

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,530
I'll move into my package here, junitdemo

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,283
and I'll create a new class.

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,623
And for the name of the class, I'll call it ConditionalTest.

9
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,090
All right, let me go ahead and expand my window here

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,973
for a second.

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,650
And what I'll do is I'll start off with a very basic test

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,250
just to kind of get things moving.

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,950
For the actual test method I'll just put a comment here

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,160
and I'm not going to get into any real testing code here.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,993
The main focus here

16
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:15,823
is just testing these unconditional assertions.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,293
So let's just go ahead and run the test real quick.

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,690
And it executes, okay?

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,523
That's awesome.

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,000
And now what I'd like to do is make this a conditional test

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,060
or actually disable the test.

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,550
So I'll disable the test and then I'll give an actual reason

23
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,570
why this test is disabled.

24
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,440
So I'll say, hey, don't run this test

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,503
until we fix JIRA one, two, three.

26
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,340
And now we run the actual test

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,540
then we'll see the output and we'll see basic tests

28
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,210
so that means that this given test is disabled, all right.

29
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,470
It's not running because of that

30
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,070
given annotation that we set up.

31
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:12,110
Okay, let's go ahead and add some more tests here

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,790
and I'll just kind of copy this section,

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,240
move down a bit and paste it.

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,880
And I'm going to test for operating systems here.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
So I will only enable this test for a given OS.

36
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,710
So I'll say EnabledOnOs,

37
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,253
and then I'll give the actual OS.WINDOWS.

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,630
So this given test will only execute

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,723
if we're running on Microsoft Windows.

40
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:03,840
And also just up top here, just double checking

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,623
make sure you have the right imports here for those items.

42
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,910
And small little typo to fix.

43
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,500
All right, that looks good.

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
All right, so here's our test.

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,273
This give test will only run on Microsoft Windows.

46
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,840
Now on my computer right now, I'm recording this on a Mac.

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,360
So when I run this this give and test will be ignored

48
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,263
or disabled.

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,230
And that's correct here, testForWindowsOnly disabled

50
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,100
because I'm on a Macintosh.

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,933
Okay, good.

52
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,313
Now let's go ahead and copy this test and paste it.

53
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,593
Make some slight mods here.

54
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,203
So this should run for Mac only.

55
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,023
Do Mac, save that.

56
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,010
Let's go ahead and run our test.

57
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,440
And great, so that test executed

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,623
because we're running on a Mac.

59
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,560
So again, conditional tests

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,360
based on the given operating system.

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,160
We can play around with some other scenarios here.

62
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,970
I can say Mac and Windows and simply set up an array.

63
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,943
So Mac, Windows,

64
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,323
and then run a test again.

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,393
And there we go, so good.

66
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:45,120
So we see the tests from Mac and Windows only.

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,633
That's fine, excellent.

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,923
And let's do one more example here for Linux.

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,920
Okay, so this one's running

70
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,100
and so the test for Linux only it's disabled

71
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,840
and because we're not running on Linux.

72
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,870
Okay, good, good.

73
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,180
So this is pretty good.

74
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,430
So good examples here of making use of conditional tests

75
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,770
based on operating system and so on.

76
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,793
So good job.
