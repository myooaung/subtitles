00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.900
All righty, let's continue with our coding.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.340
Right now we have a failing test.

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.623
We need to modify our code to make this test pass.

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.683
Let's move over into our student and grade service.

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.600
Right now it simply returns false.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.620
That's okay, but we need

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.823
to put some real functionality in here.

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.550
And first, I want to make sure that we have a student

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.763
with this given ID.

10
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.540
And if we don't have that student,

11
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.170
then we'll return false because, hey,

12
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.250
we can't really create a grade

13
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.850
for a student who doesn't exist.

14
00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:42.511
Okay.

15
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.980
So now we'll simply go through and we'll check the grade

16
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.480
and make sure it's a valid grade between zero and 100.

17
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.380
And then we simply check the grade type.

18
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.593
So at the moment, we're saving math grades.

19
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.530
So we check to see if the type is equal to math.

20
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.187
And if so, then I'll make this math grade

21
00:01:18.187 --> 00:01:20.063
and I'll set the ID to zero.

22
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.240
And at the moment, the math grade is red.

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.940
This is actually a bean that we can inject.

24
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.630
So in our NVC testing example application,

25
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.710
we have this bean as a prototype scoping,

26
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.450
what we can do in this service

27
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.970
is that we can actually inject that bean

28
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.793
and then make use of it for this given example.

29
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.050
So up here I'll make use

30
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.013
of injecting that given bean.

31
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.773
Excellent.

32
00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:09.720
So that injects that math grade bean as a prototype.

33
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.193
And now I can simply use it.

34
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.270
I'll set the grade to the actual parameter

35
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.343
that was passed in.

36
00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:29.584
I do similar thing here for student ID,

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.520
and then I'll actually save the grade

38
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.783
using the math grade Dao.

39
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.430
Now at the moment, the math grade Dao is red,

40
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.983
we simply need to inject it.

41
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.010
All righty, so that's our math grade Dao.

42
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.017
Okay.

43
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:04.850
That looks pretty good.

44
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.740
So that should take care of that red item

45
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.250
that we had down in our method.

46
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.850
So this line is a okay.

47
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.870
And now I can simply return true because, hey,

48
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.173
we successfully saved that given math grade.

49
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.030
Now let's swing back over to our test

50
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.630
and let's run this test and see how it works for us.

51
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.270
And the test passes.

52
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.420
So this is great.

53
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.840
And you can even look at the SQL here on the console window

54
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.020
and see that it actually doesn't insert into math grade.

55
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.440
We know that it's actually saving us in the database

56
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.370
and we also verify that in our test.

57
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.480
So this looks really good.

58
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.313
I'm happy.
