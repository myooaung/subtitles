00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.480
And just as a checkpoint for housekeeping

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.610
let's go ahead and comment out the display name generation

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.370
and let's simply use the display name on the actual methods

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.520
just so everything follows with the videos.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.270
So here the class level

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.580
I just did a comment on DisplayNameGeneration annotation

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.310
and then make sure that I have display name

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.233
for each one of the methods here,

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.950
and run it and we see our display name

10
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.433
showing up as desired.

11
00:00:37.993 --> 00:00:40.890
And I'll go ahead and just remove that class level reference

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.690
just so I can clean things up a bit.

13
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.620
But you can keep it, totally up to you.

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.520
All right, so getting into our coding here.

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.470
In this video, we'll cover asserts, same and not same,

16
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.563
also true and false.

17
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.740
Let's go ahead and open up DemoUtils.java,

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.190
and let's look at the code that we're going to test.

19
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.880
And so just to start out here

20
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.220
we're going to check these two fields for academy

21
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.590
and academy duplicate,

22
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.133
and we'll check if these refer to the same object.

23
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.010
And we have the appropriate getter methods

24
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.903
to give us access to those fields.

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.683
Let's go ahead and create a test for this.

26
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.513
So I'm back at my DemoUtilsTest.java.

27
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.520
I'll add this test method here

28
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.913
for testing same and not same.

29
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.252
Se up this string, luv2code.

30
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.183
Then I'll assert same,

31
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.480
demosUtils.getAcademy comma demoUtils.getAcademyDuplicate.

32
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.200
And in this scenario here

33
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.083
the objects should refer to the same object.

34
00:02:44.488 --> 00:02:45.730
And then I'll do a similar thing here

35
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.270
for assert not same.

36
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.613
String, demoUtils.getAcademy.

37
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.693
And in this case, the objects should not refer to the same.

38
00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.450
And then we run the test case

39
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.173
and the test case passes as desired, same and not same.

40
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.090
Because all we're doing is simply checking

41
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.340
to see if they're the same object references.

42
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.010
Now let's go ahead and set up another test case here

43
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.843
for testing true, false.

44
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.760
And before we write the test case,

45
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.593
let's look at the code

46
00:03:55.593 --> 00:03:57.843
to see exactly what we're testing here.

47
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.890
So I want to test this method isGreater.

48
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.443
Pass in two numbers, returns true if n1 is greater than n2.

49
00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:18.920
I'll set up these two variables here for gradeOne is 10,

50
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.970
gradeTwo equals five,

51
00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:35.070
and I'll assert true.

52
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.737
And I'll call that demoUtils.isGreater.

53
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.110
Pass in the n1, n2, so that's gradeOne comma gradeTwo.

54
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.623
So ten comma five, and this should return true.

55
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.450
And do a similar thing here for false.

56
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.770
So assert falls and I'll swap the values here.

57
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.140
GradeTwo comma gradeOne, five comma 10

58
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.253
and this should return false.

59
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.790
Go ahead and run the unit test

60
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.470
and then this test passes as desired.

61
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.303
Good job.
