00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.680
This video will cover the test

2
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.053
for creating a student.

3
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.780
For this test case of creating a student in the database.

4
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.310
We're going to send a POST request to the REST controller.

5
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.800
We'll verify the results of the JSON response.

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.573
And also verify the results by accessing data using the DAO.

7
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.830
Okay, let's go ahead and dive in.

8
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.020
In our GradebookControllerTest,

9
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.223
let's go ahead and add a new test.

10
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.933
And this is the test for creating a student.

11
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.850
First thing I'll do is I'll go ahead

12
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.420
and set some values here for my student.

13
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.393
I'll set the first name, last name, and email address.

14
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.590
Now, what I'll do is I'll perform a POST request

15
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.180
to the endpoint, to actually create this student.

16
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.220
And what I'll do is I'll make use

17
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.030
of a helper object here, the ObjectMapper,

18
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.123
it has a method called writeValueAsString.

19
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.360
Now, this is really good.

20
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.010
This ObjectMapper is from the Jackson API.

21
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.700
The writeValueAsString will actually generate a JSON string

22
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.410
from the Java object.

23
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.630
So it'll take that Java object

24
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.740
and give us the appropriate JSON,

25
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.790
and it'll include that in the actual body

26
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.960
of the HTTP request.

27
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.270
So where fed actively just converting a Java object

28
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.803
to JSON, and sending that across.

29
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.840
Once that's taken care of, we can check the response.

30
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.690
Here, I'll check the actual status

31
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.640
to make sure everything was successful.

32
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.270
And then, I'll actually check the size of the array.

33
00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.750
We initially had one student, we just created a new student.

34
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.860
So now, we can verify the JSON response array sizes, now, 2.

35
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.660
We should have two students at this time.

36
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.493
And that lets me know that,

37
00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:17.687
"Hey, this student was created successfully."

38
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.880
All righty, let's go ahead and run this test.

39
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.490
And very good.

40
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.650
We see that this test passes successfully.

41
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.483
So that's great.

42
00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:31.610
So we know that we actually created a second student here

43
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.663
for this example.

44
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.430
But now, let's go ahead and do some additional

45
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.053
double checks on the back-end.

46
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.020
And what I'd like to do is make use of the DAO,

47
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.643
and actually search for this student by their email address.

48
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.973
And so this is the email address of the student

49
00:03:51.973 --> 00:03:53.760
that we just created.

50
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.223
Alrighty, this looks good.

51
00:04:13.223 --> 00:04:15.090
Let's go ahead and run this test again.

52
00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.173
And excellent.

53
00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:19.130
So the test still passed.

54
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.529
So we know that this actual student

55
00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.990
was created on the back-end,

56
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.920
and we verified it

57
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.430
through a number of different channels here.

58
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.263
So this is great.

59
00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:26.096
I like it.

60
00:04:26.096 --> 00:04:26.929
Good job.
