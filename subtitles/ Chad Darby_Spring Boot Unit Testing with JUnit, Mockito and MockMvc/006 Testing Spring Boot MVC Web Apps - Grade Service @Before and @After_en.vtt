00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.870
One thing I'd like to do is manage our sample data.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.150
I'd like to insert and clean up sample data

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.650
using the BeforeEach and AfterEach

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.140
we'd like to insert some math, science, and history grades,

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.180
and then also clean up those given grades.

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.810
Alrighty, let's go ahead and swing into our IDE

7
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.433
and uh, let's get this set up.

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.790
And what I'll do is I'll open up my Student Grade

9
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.800
Service Test and I'll move down to the BeforeEach,

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.000
where we insert our sample data.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.150
We already have some coding here for our student.

12
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.360
We'd like to do a similar thing here

13
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.933
for our math, science, and history grades.

14
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.471
I'll insert some sample data for math_grade

15
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:57.304
for student_id of one.

16
00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:08.442
We'll do a similar thing here for science_grade

17
00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:34.633
and also for history_grade.

18
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.390
And this one student here, Eric Roby, with the student_id

19
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.490
of one, 100% on everything, I love it.

20
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.331
Alrighty, so this coding is in place here for the

21
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:04.440
BeforeEach. Now let's do a similar thing for the cleanup

22
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.713
down in the AfterEach.

23
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.770
And effectively what we'll do here is we'll do the DELETE

24
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.290
from math_grade, science_grade, and also history_grade.

25
00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.740
Alrighty so this looks really good, I like it.

26
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.540
And just as a sanity check here, let's go back

27
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.800
and run our test just to make sure that everything still

28
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.950
passes, make sure we didn't break anything.

29
00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:07.130
And we're getting all green check marks, so this is great.

30
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.650
So all of our tests passed and uh, we're in good shape.

31
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.223
So I like this, good job.
