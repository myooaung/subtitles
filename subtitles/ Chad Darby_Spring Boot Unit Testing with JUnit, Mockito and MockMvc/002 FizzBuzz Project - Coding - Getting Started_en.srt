1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,060
Alrighty, so let's get started

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,640
with our development process, writing a test,

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,420
making code pass, refactoring it,

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,573
and also repeating the process.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,740
And let's do some setup work here.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,090
First I want to go ahead and create some packages

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,780
under my test section.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,970
I want to create a new package here.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,713
So test, Java, New Package,

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,633
and I'll give it com.luv2code.tdd.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,770
Okay, so that gives us that new TDD package

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,130
under our test section,

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,520
and I want to do a similar thing here under the main section.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,280
So here under main Java,

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,893
let's create a new package and we'll give it the same name.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,440
All right, so let's move back into our test section here

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,050
and we'll go ahead and do some setup work

18
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,913
for our test under the TDD package.

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,440
And I'll just create a new class.

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,890
And for the name of this class, I'll call it FizzBuzzTest.

21
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:40,110
And there's no requirement that our tests have to be public,

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,940
so I'll simply just remove the public keyword there.

23
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,173
It's fine either way.

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,170
And what I'll do here is I'll just write out the spec

25
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,890
or the rules here for FizzBuzz

26
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,740
just to kind of keep myself on track.

27
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,313
Okay, so this looks pretty good.

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,470
Let me expand my window here

29
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,970
and kind of get down the business.

30
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,480
And so I'll just write my first test

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,370
and I'll just kind of put all the, you know, the template

32
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,133
or the structure in place for the test for right now.

33
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,550
Here, I'll test for visible by 3,

34
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,510
and I'll just stub it out.

35
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,650
I won't actually write the implementation code.

36
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,500
I'll just make it just a failing test at the moment.

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
So I'll use fail and just give a fail message.

38
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,470
So this is an assertion

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,960
that you can use just for doing an initial fail.

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,640
So we, again, we want to fail first

41
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,060
and we'll flesh this out a bit.

42
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,310
I just want to put this in there for right now.

43
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,770
Make use of the test annotation.

44
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,600
I'll set up a display name

45
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,040
and I'll also use an order because I want the test

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,660
to run in a given order mainly for a display

47
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,770
and reporting purposes here.

48
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,810
And I'll simply add the annotation up top

49
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,963
to handle method orderer by the order annotation.

50
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,620
And we've seen all this stuff before

51
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,790
in some of the previous videos.

52
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,440
Just applying what we've learned.

53
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,693
And we'll simply go through

54
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:52,880
and run this test and it fails as desired.

55
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,060
Okay, so at least we have all of our basic stuff

56
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,160
in place right now, and then we can kind of get down

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,490
to business and start doing some real coding,

58
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,840
but this looks good so far.
