00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
All righty.

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.640
In this video, we'll cover deleting Grades

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.130
for Science and History.

4
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.963
And it's really just

5
00:00:05.963 --> 00:00:08.243
more of the same of what we did for Math.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.960
Okay, we're in Student and Grade Service test

7
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.640
and this method delete Grade service.

8
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.620
Let's go ahead and copy

9
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.440
that one line that we created for Math.

10
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.090
Let's just copy and paste it for Science and History.

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.590
All righty, this coding here looks pretty good.

12
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.190
Let's go ahead and run the test.

13
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.480
All righty failing test as we expected.

14
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.623
Okay, no problem.

15
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.780
Let's go ahead and move back

16
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.570
into our Student and Grade Service

17
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.210
and let's simply add the coding here

18
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.550
for Science and History.

19
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.200
And again, it's very similar to what we did for Math.

20
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.400
And so I'll kind of sit back and be quiet for a bit

21
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.610
and just crank out these codes.

22
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.240
So just follow along with me.

23
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.150
Quiet time.

24
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.880
All righty, so I'm back.

25
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.250
We have the code in place now

26
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.830
for Science and also the code for History.

27
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.980
This looks pretty good.

28
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.070
Let me do some quick cleanup at the bottom

29
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.420
and then we'll go ahead and run our test again.

30
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.810
Green check marks,

31
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.190
that means that the test pass.

32
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.940
So, we have functionality in place

33
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.150
and we're up and running.

34
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.723
So I'd like to say, good job my friend.
