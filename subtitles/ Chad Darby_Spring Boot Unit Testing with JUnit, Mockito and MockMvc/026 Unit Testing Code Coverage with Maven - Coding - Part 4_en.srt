1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,500
We're making some good progress here,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
but one other thing we need to do

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,660
by default, the Maven Surefire plugin will not show

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,740
the display name in reports.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,160
It'll only show the method name of the test

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,400
and we don't want that.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,600
We actually want to change it

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,113
to have support for display names.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,450
So, just looking at the report here

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,170
you see all of the method names,

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,110
but some of our codes is actually using display names.

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,830
And those display name annotations are not being honored,

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,980
they're not being recognized at the moment.

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,860
And we can verify this by

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,283
simply moving back into our Demo Utils Test,

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,240
and then taking a look.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,060
We can see that this test multiply has a display name

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,140
and test equals and not equals.

19
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,260
And a couple of others here.

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,010
They're all making use of display names,

21
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,720
but none of those values are showing up

22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,013
in the actual report.

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,920
And so what we need to do is add

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,850
an additional configuration here.

25
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,040
And it's actually a pretty scary configuration,

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,780
and I it's a lot of information.

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,250
So, I'll show you how you can find this info

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,803
and figure it out on your own.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,460
So, let's swing over to our web browser here,

30
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,730
and let's visit this site, maven.apache.org/surefire.

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,220
This is where we can get documentation

32
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,833
on the surefire plugin.

33
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,113
Okay, excellent. So we're at the Maven surefire page,

34
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,410
scroll down a bit.

35
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,560
And over on the left hand side

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,363
we'll choose Maven Surefire Plugin.

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,470
And then on this page, we'll actually scroll down

38
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,693
to a section for JUnit 5.

39
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,690
So, down here under examples,

40
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,573
they have a a link here for using JUnit 5 platform.

41
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,140
And they have different configs

42
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,233
that we can use here for JUnit 5.

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,203
I'll scroll down a bit further on this page,

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,860
and I'll find the section here Surefire Extensions

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,147
and Reports Configuration for @DisplayName.

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,210
So, they basically say, Hey, these

47
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,020
this is a new feature that we've added

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,953
and this is how you configure it.

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,570
So, I'd like you to just kind of copy paste

50
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,713
some of this configuration and add it to pom.xml file.

51
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,280
So, I'll grab this section here

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,910
for the stateless test set reporter

53
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,010
and then I'll just copy this little snippet.

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,770
And then I'll swing over to my pom.xml file.

55
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,043
And I'll add this right here in this configuration section.

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,850
Now, there's a lot of stuff in here that we don't need.

57
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,020
And so I'll actually delete some of it.

58
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,110
So, I'll get rid of the disable, the version

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,393
and then the first three, use phrased items.

60
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,380
Select those items and delete them

61
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,713
because I don't need those for this example.

62
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,490
And the main thing is, make sure you're left

63
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,640
with use phrase, test case method names

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,600
and we want to have this value set to true.

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,960
This will actually show the display name

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,230
in the unit test report.

67
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,980
So, this is the kind of the the key item

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,480
that you need to have here for this configuration.

69
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,500
All right, so this is how the coach

70
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,900
should look as a checkpoint.

71
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,370
Now, let's swing back over to our terminal window here

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,660
and let's simply run the test again, Maven clean test

73
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,860
and then also let's run our Maven site command again.

74
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,360
All righty, that looks pretty good.

75
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,040
Now, let's swing back over to our web browser

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,770
to our surefire report and let's reload.

77
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,110
And again, we wanted to make sure

78
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,020
that it used our actual display names.

79
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,710
And so we have success now.

80
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,430
So, now it's showing @DisplayNames.

81
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,610
It's not showing the actual method names

82
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,490
for those test cases.

83
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,290
So, this is really good I like it.

84
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,430
And, and we're successful

85
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,513
in getting that set up and configured, good job.

86
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,670
And now one other thing I want to do here just as housekeeping

87
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,460
and clean up, I want to remove the failing tests

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,520
or those broken tests that we created

89
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,330
just so I think we'll compile and run,

90
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,550
you know without any failing tests.

91
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,093
So let's just swing back over to our IntelliJ IDE.

92
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,720
Let's move back into our DemoUtills at java,

93
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,420
that multiply method that we broke

94
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,223
and let's go ahead and repair it.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,560
So, instead of the B time speed, tone, speed

96
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,483
just for replace it with just normal, A time speed.

97
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,360
And then I just want to make sure everything works as desired.

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,803
So, just do a quick clean test here.

99
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,700
And oh gosh, this looks ugly.

100
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,533
Oh, I forgot.

101
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,340
I forgot to run that Maven site command.

102
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,800
Remember we need that for CSS and images,

103
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,700
that little workaround.

104
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,772
So we, we really do need that command.

105
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:06,970
(Instructor laughs)

106
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,990
So, I ran the site command swing back over

107
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,630
and now I do a reload and okay, excellent.

108
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,480
Great, so I'm getting into CSS styles

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,130
and I'm also getting into images.

110
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,210
Okay, that was a nice little exercise

111
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,310
that was kind of unplanned,

112
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,490
but it helped us verify

113
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,750
that we really do need the Maven site command.

114
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,520
All righty. So this is all really good stuff.

115
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,670
All of our tests are passing.

116
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,030
There's no failures and we're kind of in good shape here.

117
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,033
So, good job again for all of your hard work.
