00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,540
In this video we're going to have an MVC test

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,230
for creating a grade.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,310
This will actually test for creating a grade

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,170
when the student does not exist.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,313
Basically an invalid student ID.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,460
Let's go ahead and move in here

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,423
to our grade book controller test.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,583
And let's go ahead and add this new test.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,030
We're going to attempt to create a valid grade

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,963
when the student does not exist.

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,490
The first thing that we'll do

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,010
is we'll perform the HTTP request,

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,823
we'll make use of a post to that end point, grades.

14
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,140
And then we'll pass in those three parameters

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,453
for grade, grade type, and student ID.

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,990
And then notice here,

17
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,740
for the student ID we'll pass in the value of zero.

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,250
The student actually doesn't exist.

19
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,013
That's an in invalid student ID.

20
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:57,099
And then we simply wrap it up with a normal coding here.

21
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,093
We'll get the model and view.

22
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,010
And then we'll simply assert the view name

23
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,100
and we'll make sure that we have the error name.

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,050
So this interaction should return the error page

25
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,813
because that student doesn't exist.

26
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,860
Let's go ahead and run our test, real quick.

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,180
And we'll see the at the test passed.

28
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,390
So this is great.

29
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,950
Now you may wonder, how did this code pass?

30
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,910
Well, if you remember in our grade book controller,

31
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,020
we already have a method, we had grade,

32
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,200
that already performs this check.

33
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,840
We have code that checks if the student does not exist.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,220
If they don't exist, it returns error.

35
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,300
This is great.

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,660
We already have the code in place.

37
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,820
We simply wrote a test to handle for that edge case

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,210
and that test passed.

39
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,040
So we have some really good coverage here.

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,260
This looks really good.

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,093
I'm happy.
