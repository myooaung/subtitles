00:00:00.320  -->  00:00:01.570
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome back to the course</v>
2

2

00:00:01.570  -->  00:00:02.730
on deep learning.
3

3

00:00:02.730  -->  00:00:04.860
Today, we're starting off the part of the course
4

4

00:00:04.860  -->  00:00:07.000
about self-organizing maps.
5

5

00:00:07.000  -->  00:00:09.000
It's going to be another exciting part.
6

6

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:11.210
It's gonna be quite an easy part.
7

7

00:00:11.210  -->  00:00:13.500
But it's going to have its own nuances.
8

8

00:00:13.500  -->  00:00:14.830
So let's get started.
9

9

00:00:14.830  -->  00:00:17.210
We already talked about artificial neural networks,
10

10

00:00:17.210  -->  00:00:20.040
convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks
11

11

00:00:20.040  -->  00:00:21.000
in this course.
12

12

00:00:21.000  -->  00:00:23.900
And that sums up the deep learning methods
13

13

00:00:23.900  -->  00:00:27.360
which are collectively called supervised deep learning.
14

14

00:00:27.360  -->  00:00:31.530
And today we're starting off into our first unsupervised
15

15

00:00:31.530  -->  00:00:34.760
deep learning method which is the self-organizing map.
16

16

00:00:34.760  -->  00:00:38.560
And the self-organizing maps were invented in the 1980s
17

17

00:00:38.560  -->  00:00:41.040
by this gentleman over here, Teuvo Kohone.
18

18

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:43.450
So once again this is a recent photo
19

19

00:00:43.450  -->  00:00:45.220
from just recent years,
20

20

00:00:45.220  -->  00:00:48.050
and obviously it's been a long time
21

21

00:00:48.050  -->  00:00:50.980
since he invented the self-organizing maps.
22

22

00:00:50.980  -->  00:00:55.060
And sometimes they're even called the Kohonen maps
23

23

00:00:55.060  -->  00:00:57.500
just because he was really the first person
24

24

00:00:57.500  -->  00:00:59.560
to ever come up with this concept.
25

25

00:00:59.560  -->  00:01:02.530
And so what are self-organizing maps used for?
26

26

00:01:02.530  -->  00:01:05.000
Well, there is four reducing dimensionality
27

27

00:01:05.000  -->  00:01:08.010
and here's a great example from a paper.
28

28

00:01:08.010  -->  00:01:10.410
And by the way this is a very interesting application
29

29

00:01:10.410  -->  00:01:11.350
of self-organizing maps.
30

30

00:01:11.350  -->  00:01:14.380
This paper itself is about using
31

31

00:01:14.380  -->  00:01:16.540
self-organizing maps in astronomy.
32

32

00:01:16.540  -->  00:01:17.860
Very interesting as well.
33

33

00:01:17.860  -->  00:01:21.010
And here, they've got a beautiful visualization
34

34

00:01:21.010  -->  00:01:23.460
of how self-organizing maps actually work.
35

35

00:01:23.460  -->  00:01:26.210
They take a multi-dimensional data set
36

36

00:01:26.210  -->  00:01:28.700
which might have lots and lots and lots columns
37

37

00:01:28.700  -->  00:01:30.950
which are the dimensions of the data set
38

38

00:01:30.950  -->  00:01:33.120
and of course lots and lots of rows
39

39

00:01:33.120  -->  00:01:36.470
and they reduce the dimensionality of these data sets.
40

40

00:01:36.470  -->  00:01:39.580
So basically, instead of having 20, 30 or a hundred
41

41

00:01:39.580  -->  00:01:42.840
or even more columns, you end up with a map,
42

42

00:01:42.840  -->  00:01:45.090
and that's what they call a self-organizing map
43

43

00:01:45.090  -->  00:01:47.050
so you end up with a two-dimensional
44

44

00:01:47.050  -->  00:01:49.190
representation of your data set.
45

45

00:01:49.190  -->  00:01:52.670
The purpose or point of the SOM is to reduce
46

46

00:01:52.670  -->  00:01:53.920
the amount of columns.
47

47

00:01:53.920  -->  00:01:56.540
So reduce the amount of columns from many,
48

48

00:01:56.540  -->  00:02:00.140
many, many columns into just the two-dimensions
49

49

00:02:00.140  -->  00:02:03.930
that you have on a two-dimensional output.
50

50

00:02:03.930  -->  00:02:04.950
And so this is how it works.
51

51

00:02:04.950  -->  00:02:06.260
And we'll go into more detail on this
52

52

00:02:06.260  -->  00:02:10.350
when we're talking about how a self-organizing map learns.
53

53

00:02:10.350  -->  00:02:11.870
For now, we just want to get the feel
54

54

00:02:11.870  -->  00:02:13.130
for what we are aiming for,
55

55

00:02:13.130  -->  00:02:17.780
what is the whole point of invoking a self-organizing map,
56

56

00:02:17.780  -->  00:02:18.870
what is the outcome.
57

57

00:02:18.870  -->  00:02:20.870
And once we know that, it will be easier for us
58

58

00:02:20.870  -->  00:02:25.640
to understand why and how we are getting it to learn
59

59

00:02:25.640  -->  00:02:28.250
and getting it to perform what it is performing.
60

60

00:02:28.250  -->  00:02:30.320
So here is a SOM.
61

61

00:02:30.320  -->  00:02:33.160
So this is an actual self-organizing map
62

62

00:02:33.160  -->  00:02:34.440
which was produced,
63

63

00:02:34.440  -->  00:02:37.270
and what it is depicting is actually
64

64

00:02:37.270  -->  00:02:41.220
the different states of prosperity and poverty
65

65

00:02:41.220  -->  00:02:42.140
in different countries.
66

66

00:02:42.140  -->  00:02:44.770
So here you actually have countries of the world
67

67

00:02:44.770  -->  00:02:49.450
and this self-organizing map has put them into clusters
68

68

00:02:49.450  -->  00:02:52.610
based on lots of different indicators.
69

69

00:02:52.610  -->  00:02:54.370
In fact in this specific example,
70

70

00:02:54.370  -->  00:02:57.320
39 different indicators were used.
71

71

00:02:57.320  -->  00:02:59.870
And indicators are parameters describing things
72

72

00:02:59.870  -->  00:03:02.960
such as quality of life, factors,
73

73

00:03:02.960  -->  00:03:05.770
the state of health in a country,
74

74

00:03:05.770  -->  00:03:08.100
nutrition, educational services,
75

75

00:03:08.100  -->  00:03:09.620
and so on, and so on, and so on.
76

76

00:03:09.620  -->  00:03:11.390
And so you can imagine a huge data set
77

77

00:03:11.390  -->  00:03:13.950
with your 200 plus countries as your rows
78

78

00:03:13.950  -->  00:03:16.200
and 39 different columns.
79

79

00:03:16.200  -->  00:03:19.690
So it's impossible to visualize that on its own
80

80

00:03:19.690  -->  00:03:21.210
but then if you use a SOM,
81

81

00:03:21.210  -->  00:03:22.890
you can reduce the dimensionality
82

82

00:03:22.890  -->  00:03:24.430
and present it as a map like this.
83

83

00:03:24.430  -->  00:03:26.480
So you can see that in the top left corner,
84

84

00:03:26.480  -->  00:03:30.220
you have countries with the best or the least
85

85

00:03:30.220  -->  00:03:32.910
alarming state of poverty.
86

86

00:03:32.910  -->  00:03:37.910
You have Belgium here, you have Sweden, Japan, Spain.
87

87

00:03:38.250  -->  00:03:39.230
You have Greece here.
88

88

00:03:39.230  -->  00:03:41.810
So you can see that it's slowly going
89

89

00:03:41.810  -->  00:03:43.830
towards the other end of spectrum
90

90

00:03:43.830  -->  00:03:46.710
where you have countries with the most alarming
91

91

00:03:46.710  -->  00:03:48.060
state of poverty,
92

92

00:03:48.060  -->  00:03:50.920
where you have countries like Ethiopia over here,
93

93

00:03:50.920  -->  00:03:52.740
then you have countries.
94

94

00:03:52.740  -->  00:03:53.870
I think this is Zimbabwe.
95

95

00:03:53.870  -->  00:03:56.750
I'm not 100% sure but based on the code
96

96

00:03:56.750  -->  00:03:57.583
looks like Zimbabwe.
97

97

00:03:57.583  -->  00:04:00.983
Then you have Guatemala possibly, and so on.
98

98

00:04:01.960  -->  00:04:05.280
By these codes, you can study this map more and understand.
99

99

00:04:05.280  -->  00:04:07.150
There's Australia, by the way.
100

100

00:04:07.150  -->  00:04:08.700
If anybody's watching from Australia.
101

101

00:04:08.700  -->  00:04:10.470
So, interesting map.
102

102

00:04:10.470  -->  00:04:11.350
Sources over here.
103

103

00:04:11.350  -->  00:04:12.980
It's from Finland as well.
104

104

00:04:12.980  -->  00:04:14.400
So what can we do with this map?
105

105

00:04:14.400  -->  00:04:17.193
Well, first of all, it's already a great representation.
106

106

00:04:18.167  -->  00:04:20.100
So the self-organizing map was able to
107

107

00:04:20.100  -->  00:04:21.580
in an unsupervised manner.
108

108

00:04:21.580  -->  00:04:22.760
So this is important to understand.
109

109

00:04:22.760  -->  00:04:24.730
This algorithm is different to everything else
110

110

00:04:24.730  -->  00:04:26.060
we've seen before.
111

111

00:04:26.060  -->  00:04:30.030
It has training data but it doesn't have any labels
112

112

00:04:30.030  -->  00:04:30.863
in the training data,
113

113

00:04:30.863  -->  00:04:33.120
so it's not like a convolutional neural network
114

114

00:04:33.120  -->  00:04:35.440
where it actually can learn what it's seeing
115

115

00:04:35.440  -->  00:04:37.400
and then apply that to the test.
116

116

00:04:37.400  -->  00:04:39.970
In fact this algorithm is unsupervised
117

117

00:04:39.970  -->  00:04:41.970
so it's basically just given data, data, data
118

118

00:04:41.970  -->  00:04:44.740
and then it learns to group these countries.
119

119

00:04:44.740  -->  00:04:47.070
So it wasn't told that Belgium and Sweden
120

120

00:04:47.070  -->  00:04:51.120
and the Netherlands have to go close together.
121

121

00:04:51.120  -->  00:04:52.690
It just learned that from the data.
122

122

00:04:52.690  -->  00:04:54.617
It realized that, "Oh okay, these countries
123

123

00:04:54.617  -->  00:04:57.527
"seem very similar based on all of the indicators
124

124

00:04:57.527  -->  00:04:58.520
"I'm looking at."
125

125

00:04:58.520  -->  00:05:01.070
And these countries seem very similar.
126

126

00:05:01.070  -->  00:05:02.320
These countries seem similar.
127

127

00:05:02.320  -->  00:05:03.440
And these countries seem similar.
128

128

00:05:03.440  -->  00:05:06.140
And you can see how it's slowly, gradually
129

129

00:05:06.140  -->  00:05:09.910
going from the least alarming state of poverty in countries
130

130

00:05:09.910  -->  00:05:11.430
to the most alarming state of poverty
131

131

00:05:11.430  -->  00:05:14.370
or like from left to right in this specific case.
132

132

00:05:14.370  -->  00:05:16.380
And all of that it learned on its own.
133

133

00:05:16.380  -->  00:05:17.360
So that's why it's called
134

134

00:05:17.360  -->  00:05:19.570
an unsupervised learning algorithm.
135

135

00:05:19.570  -->  00:05:21.130
And what else can we do with this map?
136

136

00:05:21.130  -->  00:05:22.960
Well, as we said, this is already
137

137

00:05:22.960  -->  00:05:24.960
a pretty valuable representation
138

138

00:05:24.960  -->  00:05:26.730
but take it further, we can actually
139

139

00:05:26.730  -->  00:05:28.540
put it onto a world map.
140

140

00:05:28.540  -->  00:05:30.420
So they take those same colors and put them
141

141

00:05:30.420  -->  00:05:31.951
onto world map and see what we get.
142

142

00:05:31.951  -->  00:05:33.620
And as you can see here,
143

143

00:05:33.620  -->  00:05:35.590
you have a beautiful world map
144

144

00:05:35.590  -->  00:05:37.640
which shows you exactly those things.
145

145

00:05:37.640  -->  00:05:40.320
So least alarming state of poverty over here,
146

146

00:05:40.320  -->  00:05:41.400
here and here.
147

147

00:05:41.400  -->  00:05:43.370
And then you have countries of the most alarming.
148

148

00:05:43.370  -->  00:05:46.440
And as you can see based on what we know,
149

149

00:05:46.440  -->  00:05:48.280
based on the general knowledge
150

150

00:05:48.280  -->  00:05:50.770
we have about first world countries
151

151

00:05:50.770  -->  00:05:51.910
and third world countries,
152

152

00:05:51.910  -->  00:05:53.520
and where countries are developed,
153

153

00:05:53.520  -->  00:05:55.030
where countries are still developing.
154

154

00:05:55.030  -->  00:05:58.000
And there's still certain problems
155

155

00:05:58.000  -->  00:05:59.880
that are being overcome with time
156

156

00:05:59.880  -->  00:06:02.785
but there's still not at the state
157

157

00:06:02.785  -->  00:06:05.410
as the world communities would like them to be.
158

158

00:06:05.410  -->  00:06:08.060
You can see right away that this self-organizing map
159

159

00:06:08.060  -->  00:06:10.600
did make quite a good prediction
160

160

00:06:10.600  -->  00:06:13.200
that here in these countries,
161

161

00:06:13.200  -->  00:06:15.023
you've got quite a good state,
162

162

00:06:16.020  -->  00:06:18.030
the state of poverty isn't that alarming
163

163

00:06:18.030  -->  00:06:21.250
as it is in countries here and for instance here
164

164

00:06:21.250  -->  00:06:24.760
and in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.
165

165

00:06:24.760  -->  00:06:26.720
So it was even able to distinguish
166

166

00:06:26.720  -->  00:06:28.820
Western Europe from Eastern Europe, things like that.
167

167

00:06:28.820  -->  00:06:30.870
So it's done quite a good job
168

168

00:06:30.870  -->  00:06:33.510
and you can take those colors and put them on a map
169

169

00:06:33.510  -->  00:06:35.700
and it's even more approachable.
170

170

00:06:35.700  -->  00:06:38.640
It's even more understandable for humans in this form.
171

171

00:06:38.640  -->  00:06:41.850
So that's one application of a self-organizing map.
172

172

00:06:41.850  -->  00:06:45.140
In fact this is just one application.
173

173

00:06:45.140  -->  00:06:47.660
There's so many different ways
174

174

00:06:47.660  -->  00:06:50.400
and industries and different problems
175

175

00:06:50.400  -->  00:06:52.150
where you can apply self-organizing maps.
176

176

00:06:52.150  -->  00:06:54.130
And so just to summarize this one.
177

177

00:06:54.130  -->  00:06:57.190
What happened here is we had the data,
178

178

00:06:57.190  -->  00:06:59.380
which you can get from the World Bank,
179

179

00:06:59.380  -->  00:07:01.830
and you can just download data sets from there.
180

180

00:07:01.830  -->  00:07:03.330
And it had lots and lots of columns.
181

181

00:07:03.330  -->  00:07:04.800
So here we can only see just three columns
182

182

00:07:04.800  -->  00:07:07.660
but there's actually 39 indicators in this data.
183

183

00:07:07.660  -->  00:07:10.820
So things like health expenditure, education expenditures,
184

184

00:07:10.820  -->  00:07:13.400
percentage of GDP, the inflation possibly
185

185

00:07:13.400  -->  00:07:16.360
and other factors that went into this data set.
186

186

00:07:16.360  -->  00:07:18.290
All of them went into the self-organizing map.
187

187

00:07:18.290  -->  00:07:19.380
And you could stop here.
188

188

00:07:19.380  -->  00:07:22.480
This is already a great result and it will help you.
189

189

00:07:22.480  -->  00:07:23.900
Imagine you didn't know,
190

190

00:07:23.900  -->  00:07:25.830
you didn't have this intrinsic knowledge.
191

191

00:07:25.830  -->  00:07:28.000
It would help you group your data set.
192

192

00:07:28.000  -->  00:07:29.270
It could be not just countries.
193

193

00:07:29.270  -->  00:07:30.760
It could be diseases
194

194

00:07:30.760  -->  00:07:34.410
or it could be different types of equipment
195

195

00:07:34.410  -->  00:07:37.570
that you might be considering or you might be selling
196

196

00:07:37.570  -->  00:07:38.470
through your organization,
197

197

00:07:38.470  -->  00:07:40.690
different types of stock and inventory.
198

198

00:07:40.690  -->  00:07:42.370
And it could group them for you.
199

199

00:07:42.370  -->  00:07:46.790
And you would understand different similarities
200

200

00:07:46.790  -->  00:07:48.200
based on all of your data.
201

201

00:07:48.200  -->  00:07:49.610
You wouldn't have to go through hundreds
202

202

00:07:49.610  -->  00:07:50.640
and hundreds of columns.
203

203

00:07:50.640  -->  00:07:52.570
You would be able to just look at this map
204

204

00:07:52.570  -->  00:07:55.190
and quickly understand all of the similarities.
205

205

00:07:55.190  -->  00:07:56.820
But in this case, we were able to take it
206

206

00:07:56.820  -->  00:07:59.410
even a step further and visualize it on a map
207

207

00:07:59.410  -->  00:08:03.070
which is even better and even more representable.
208

208

00:08:03.070  -->  00:08:06.360
So there we go, that's how self-organizing maps work.
209

209

00:08:06.360  -->  00:08:09.110
And if you'd like to get some additional reading
210

210

00:08:09.110  -->  00:08:11.160
before we proceed with the next tutorials,
211

211

00:08:11.160  -->  00:08:14.490
then a good paper to check out by Teuvo Kohonen
212

212

00:08:14.490  -->  00:08:17.950
from 1990, it's called The Self-Organizing Map.
213

213

00:08:17.950  -->  00:08:20.260
And basically, he goes through quite a few examples
214

214

00:08:20.260  -->  00:08:22.790
of applications of self-organizing maps
215

215

00:08:22.790  -->  00:08:24.970
and draw some conclusions there.
216

216

00:08:24.970  -->  00:08:28.170
So check it out and I will see you on the next tutorial.
217

217

00:08:28.170  -->  00:08:29.953
Until then, enjoy deep learning!
