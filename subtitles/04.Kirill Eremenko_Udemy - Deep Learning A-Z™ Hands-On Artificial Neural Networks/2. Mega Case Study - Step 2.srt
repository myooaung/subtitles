<v Narrator>Hello and welcome to the Part One of the</v>
2

2

00:00:02,380  -->  00:00:04,980
Creation of our Hybrid Deep Learning Model.
3

3

00:00:04,980  -->  00:00:07,720
As you understood, this part one is about making
4

4

00:00:07,720  -->  00:00:09,610
the unsupervised deep learning branch
5

5

00:00:09,610  -->  00:00:11,290
of our hybrid deep learning model.
6

6

00:00:11,290  -->  00:00:13,350
This will be the self-organizing map
7

7

00:00:13,350  -->  00:00:15,330
which we'll use to identify the frauds
8

8

00:00:15,330  -->  00:00:17,550
exactly as we did in Part Four.
9

9

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:19,470
So, this will be good stuff, but
10

10

00:00:19,470  -->  00:00:21,760
then the challenge will be to combine the two
11

11

00:00:21,760  -->  00:00:23,620
and so the tricky part of this challenge
12

12

00:00:23,620  -->  00:00:26,027
comes afterwards with Part Two,
13

13

00:00:26,027  -->  00:00:28,800
"Going from Unsupervised to Supervised Deep Learning."
14

14

00:00:28,800  -->  00:00:30,410
But it's good that we can start easy.
15

15

00:00:30,410  -->  00:00:32,160
This will warm us up.
16

16

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:33,890
Alright so, let's go to our
17

17

00:00:33,890  -->  00:00:36,120
self-organizing map code template.
18

18

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:38,020
As I just said, now it is kid stuff
19

19

00:00:38,020  -->  00:00:41,060
because we simply need to copy all this code
20

20

00:00:41,060  -->  00:00:45,004
to identify the frauds and paste that
21

21

00:00:45,004  -->  00:00:47,730
back into our "Make a Case" study
22

22

00:00:47,730  -->  00:00:49,710
and now what do we have to do?
23

23

00:00:49,710  -->  00:00:52,570
Well, first, we'll execute this part
24

24

00:00:52,570  -->  00:00:55,970
of the code to get a map, the self-organizing map
25

25

00:00:55,970  -->  00:00:58,320
that will contain the outlying neurons.
26

26

00:00:58,320  -->  00:01:00,720
Here it is, and, as we can see,
27

27

00:01:00,720  -->  00:01:03,240
we clearly get this outline neuron,
28

28

00:01:03,240  -->  00:01:04,930
which is an outline neuron because
29

29

00:01:04,930  -->  00:01:07,300
it is characterized by a large MID,
30

30

00:01:07,300  -->  00:01:09,290
the Mean Interneuron Distance,
31

31

00:01:09,290  -->  00:01:12,520
and besides, it contains both categories of customers,
32

32

00:01:12,520  -->  00:01:15,020
customers that got their application approved,
33

33

00:01:15,020  -->  00:01:17,700
and customers that didn't get their application approved.
34

34

00:01:17,700  -->  00:01:18,630
So that's perfect.
35

35

00:01:18,630  -->  00:01:21,350
We got the frauds for the two types of scenarios.
36

36

00:01:21,350  -->  00:01:25,310
Now, selecting the outlying neuron is kind of arbitrary,
37

37

00:01:25,310  -->  00:01:27,227
because it actually depends on the
38

38

00:01:27,227  -->  00:01:30,600
threshold we want to get to select these neurons.
39

39

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:33,620
Either we want to take the whitest neurons,
40

40

00:01:33,620  -->  00:01:36,080
and in that case we would only take this one,
41

41

00:01:36,080  -->  00:01:39,330
or we can decrease the threshold a little bit,
42

42

00:01:39,330  -->  00:01:41,987
in which case we could also include this one.
43

43

00:01:41,987  -->  00:01:45,450
Let's do that to include as much information as we can
44

44

00:01:45,450  -->  00:01:48,750
and you can even go further and take some more over there.
45

45

00:01:48,750  -->  00:01:50,850
Well, let's take the whitest one and then,
46

46

00:01:50,850  -->  00:01:54,100
all the rest of the neurons are regular neurons,
47

47

00:01:54,100  -->  00:01:56,750
common neurons that follow the general rules,
48

48

00:01:56,750  -->  00:02:00,090
and therefore look definitely like non-potential frauds.
49

49

00:02:00,090  -->  00:02:03,510
The frauds are definitely in this class here,
50

50

00:02:03,510  -->  00:02:06,080
and more particularly, in this neuron.
51

51

00:02:06,080  -->  00:02:07,900
Alright so, now we have to get the
52

52

00:02:07,900  -->  00:02:09,750
coordinates of these two neurons.
53

53

00:02:09,750  -->  00:02:13,400
So the first one has coordinates five and three
54

54

00:02:13,400  -->  00:02:16,880
and the second one has coordinates eight and three.
55

55

00:02:16,880  -->  00:02:18,803
So five, three and eight, three.
56

56

00:02:19,900  -->  00:02:22,140
So let's input that here.
57

57

00:02:22,140  -->  00:02:25,410
The first one has coordinates five, three
58

58

00:02:25,410  -->  00:02:30,020
and the second one, eight, three.
59

59

00:02:30,020  -->  00:02:32,200
Alright and now we're ready to get
60

60

00:02:32,200  -->  00:02:34,670
the list of the frauds, the potential frauds,
61

61

00:02:34,670  -->  00:02:37,850
and to do this, we need to execute this code.
62

62

00:02:37,850  -->  00:02:40,820
Here we go. Now let's go to variable explore
63

63

00:02:40,820  -->  00:02:44,320
and we get 37 frauds, so that's pretty good.
64

64

00:02:44,320  -->  00:02:46,400
That gives us, pretty much, information.
65

65

00:02:46,400  -->  00:02:48,970
I still don't know if the best model is to take
66

66

00:02:48,970  -->  00:02:50,950
only the whitest outlying neuron
67

67

00:02:50,950  -->  00:02:53,440
that we identified or to take the two.
68

68

00:02:53,440  -->  00:02:55,420
Well, I'm taking the challenge here with you,
69

69

00:02:55,420  -->  00:02:57,720
but you're welcome to try other ways
70

70

00:02:57,720  -->  00:03:00,330
and I'd be very happy if you get better results than mine.
71

71

00:03:00,330  -->  00:03:02,940
So, feel free to explore and improve your model.
72

72

00:03:02,940  -->  00:03:04,500
What matters is that you practice
73

73

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:06,120
and, if possible, succeed.
74

74

00:03:06,120  -->  00:03:09,390
And that's great if you succeed making a very robust model,
75

75

00:03:09,390  -->  00:03:12,140
even more robust than the one we're about to make.
76

76

00:03:12,140  -->  00:03:14,610
Alright, so we identified 37 frauds,
77

77

00:03:14,610  -->  00:03:16,230
and so now what we're gonna do
78

78

00:03:16,230  -->  00:03:18,870
is use the results that we just got here.
79

79

00:03:18,870  -->  00:03:21,980
That is, this list of frauds to go from
80

80

00:03:21,980  -->  00:03:24,630
unsupervised to supervised deep learning
81

81

00:03:24,630  -->  00:03:26,530
because to go from unsupervised
82

82

00:03:26,530  -->  00:03:28,940
to supervised deep learning, what do we need?
83

83

00:03:28,940  -->  00:03:31,250
Well, we need a dependent variable
84

84

00:03:31,250  -->  00:03:33,430
because with unsupervised deep learning,
85

85

00:03:33,430  -->  00:03:35,550
we don't consider any dependent variable
86

86

00:03:35,550  -->  00:03:38,020
because it was trained on our features
87

87

00:03:38,020  -->  00:03:40,410
without using any dependent variable.
88

88

00:03:40,410  -->  00:03:42,130
But when doing supervised deep learning,
89

89

00:03:42,130  -->  00:03:44,250
we need a dependent variable because we need
90

90

00:03:44,250  -->  00:03:46,280
the model to understand some correlations
91

91

00:03:46,280  -->  00:03:50,080
between the features and a result, an outcome,
92

92

00:03:50,080  -->  00:03:52,380
And the outcome is in the dependent variable.
93

93

00:03:52,380  -->  00:03:54,330
So now, that's where comes the tricky part.
94

94

00:03:54,330  -->  00:03:56,290
There will be more tricky parts after that,
95

95

00:03:56,290  -->  00:03:58,990
but that's the most important thing to understand.
96

96

00:03:58,990  -->  00:04:01,552
How are we going to create this dependent variable?
97

97

00:04:01,552  -->  00:04:03,900
As soon as we manage to do that,
98

98

00:04:03,900  -->  00:04:06,330
we will have all the ingredients to train
99

99

00:04:06,330  -->  00:04:08,870
our future supervised deep learning model,
100

100

00:04:08,870  -->  00:04:11,060
which will be our artificial neural network.
101

101

00:04:11,060  -->  00:04:13,660
So think about it and I'll give you the answer
102

102

00:04:13,660  -->  00:04:16,553
in the next tutorial. Until then, enjoy deep learning.
