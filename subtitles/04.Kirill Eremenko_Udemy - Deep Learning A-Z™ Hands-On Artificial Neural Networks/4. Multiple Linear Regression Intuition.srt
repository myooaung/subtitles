00:00:00,090  -->  00:00:01,580
<v ->Multiple linear regression,</v>
2

2

00:00:01,580  -->  00:00:03,100
same thing but many variables.
3

3

00:00:03,100  -->  00:00:05,280
So B, zero one constant and then,
4

4

00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:08,065
many combinations or many pairs of
5

5

00:00:08,065  -->  00:00:10,110
B and X,
6

6

00:00:10,110  -->  00:00:12,360
and it can go up to quite a lot.
7

7

00:00:12,360  -->  00:00:14,480
Depends on how many regressions you have.
8

8

00:00:14,480  -->  00:00:16,700
Here once again you got a dependent variable, Y
9

9

00:00:16,700  -->  00:00:17,533
So something you are explaining,
10

10

00:00:17,533  -->  00:00:19,540
but this time the difference is that,
11

11

00:00:19,540  -->  00:00:22,135
you think there might be a few causation here so,
12

12

00:00:22,135  -->  00:00:25,490
in the case of salary for instance it could be,
13

13

00:00:25,490  -->  00:00:27,470
how many years of experience you've done?
14

14

00:00:27,470  -->  00:00:30,490
How many other courses you've done?
15

15

00:00:30,490  -->  00:00:32,423
How much, you know?
16

16

00:00:33,510  -->  00:00:35,120
How much time you spend at work.
17

17

00:00:35,120  -->  00:00:36,450
Or, things like that,
18

18

00:00:36,450  -->  00:00:40,858
or how valuable, how much money you make for the company?
19

19

00:00:40,858  -->  00:00:43,700
In terms of a student and his grade so if your dependent
20

20

00:00:43,700  -->  00:00:45,580
variable is what grade does a student get?
21

21

00:00:45,580  -->  00:00:47,426
Then the independent variables could be,
22

22

00:00:47,426  -->  00:00:51,040
how much the student has studied for the exam?
23

23

00:00:51,040  -->  00:00:53,554
Maybe how much he has slept before the exam?
24

24

00:00:53,554  -->  00:00:57,058
How many lectures he has attended throughout the course?
25

25

00:00:57,058  -->  00:00:58,643
And things like that.
26

26

00:00:59,640  -->  00:01:00,980
The constant is still there
27

27

00:01:00,980  -->  00:01:02,743
and also you got the coefficients.
