00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:01,360
<v Instructor>Hello, and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:01,360  -->  00:00:02,650
to the course on deep learning.
3

3

00:00:02,650  -->  00:00:04,780
Today is a clarity tutorial.
4

4

00:00:04,780  -->  00:00:06,630
Today we're going to just quickly mention
5

5

00:00:06,630  -->  00:00:09,640
on why we need to revisit K-Means clustering.
6

6

00:00:09,640  -->  00:00:11,550
And then, we'll proceed with the course.
7

7

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:12,940
So, let's have a look.
8

8

00:00:12,940  -->  00:00:17,940
Here we've got a image, a screenshot from one of
9

9

00:00:18,030  -->  00:00:21,349
our previous courses, a course that Hadelin and I created
10

10

00:00:21,349  -->  00:00:24,130
sometime ago called machine learning A to Zed,
11

11

00:00:24,130  -->  00:00:26,100
and I know it seems kind of odd you've got
12

12

00:00:26,100  -->  00:00:27,330
a course inside a course.
13

13

00:00:27,330  -->  00:00:29,870
So it's like Inception, but the point of this
14

14

00:00:29,870  -->  00:00:31,770
tutorial is just to mention that
15

15

00:00:31,770  -->  00:00:34,300
the next video in our current course
16

16

00:00:34,300  -->  00:00:38,509
is a video from that course on machine learning A to Zed.
17

17

00:00:38,509  -->  00:00:42,210
We've specifically taken that video to refresh
18

18

00:00:42,210  -->  00:00:44,960
your knowledge, or even if you haven't learned about
19

19

00:00:44,960  -->  00:00:46,300
K-Means clustering before,
20

20

00:00:46,300  -->  00:00:48,660
then to introduce you to K-Means clustering,
21

21

00:00:48,660  -->  00:00:51,020
because knowing K-Means clustering will be
22

22

00:00:51,020  -->  00:00:54,100
helpful when you're learning self-organizing maps.
23

23

00:00:54,100  -->  00:00:55,640
And you'll probably come across this concept
24

24

00:00:55,640  -->  00:00:58,680
in other places if you decide to study
25

25

00:00:58,680  -->  00:01:01,120
self-organizing maps in more detail.
26

26

00:01:01,120  -->  00:01:03,350
The thing I wanted to point out here is that
27

27

00:01:03,350  -->  00:01:06,230
K-Means clustering is relevant to SOMs.
28

28

00:01:06,230  -->  00:01:08,010
It's not exactly identical.
29

29

00:01:08,010  -->  00:01:11,870
It's not going to be your like one-stop shop
30

30

00:01:11,870  -->  00:01:15,020
and help you understand SOMs all of a sudden instantly,
31

31

00:01:15,020  -->  00:01:17,050
but it will prepare you for understanding
32

32

00:01:17,050  -->  00:01:18,440
self-organizing maps.
33

33

00:01:18,440  -->  00:01:21,130
And specifically there's a couple of things that
34

34

00:01:21,130  -->  00:01:23,990
I like about the K-Means clustering algorithm
35

35

00:01:23,990  -->  00:01:26,000
and looking at this video that's coming up,
36

36

00:01:26,000  -->  00:01:28,874
you will see how this whole process of
37

37

00:01:28,874  -->  00:01:32,500
jumping around, how, like, pushing and pulling
38

38

00:01:32,500  -->  00:01:35,490
is happening as those nodes, or
39

39

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:38,890
as those centroids are traveling across the map.
40

40

00:01:38,890  -->  00:01:40,870
At how they're being pulled and pushed around
41

41

00:01:40,870  -->  00:01:42,930
by the actual data points,
42

42

00:01:42,930  -->  00:01:45,840
and that kind of similar process is going to
43

43

00:01:45,840  -->  00:01:47,410
be happening in self-organizing maps.
44

44

00:01:47,410  -->  00:01:50,320
So you'll get you into, it'll prepare you for
45

45

00:01:50,320  -->  00:01:53,090
the mood of what's going to be happening in SOMs,
46

46

00:01:53,090  -->  00:01:54,932
and that's why it's useful.
47

47

00:01:54,932  -->  00:01:56,801
And also the other thing is that
48

48

00:01:56,801  -->  00:02:01,550
K-Means clustering is a unsupervised type of algorithm.
49

49

00:02:01,550  -->  00:02:03,425
Albeit, it's not a neural network.
50

50

00:02:03,425  -->  00:02:06,640
It's just an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm,
51

51

00:02:06,640  -->  00:02:08,650
but at the same time, it'll also prepare you
52

52

00:02:08,650  -->  00:02:10,610
in terms of unsupervised learning.
53

53

00:02:10,610  -->  00:02:11,443
So there we go.
54

54

00:02:11,443  -->  00:02:13,530
That's why we need to revisit K-Means clustering,
55

55

00:02:13,530  -->  00:02:15,450
and I hope you enjoy the next tutorial.
56

56

00:02:15,450  -->  00:02:17,290
And I'll see you back here after that.
57

57

00:02:17,290  -->  00:02:19,493
And until then, enjoy deep learning.
