00:00:00.090  -->  00:00:00.923
<v Instructor>Hello, and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:00.923  -->  00:00:02.450
to the course on deep learning.
3

3

00:00:02.450  -->  00:00:04.150
Super excited to have you on board.
4

4

00:00:04.150  -->  00:00:05.430
And today I'm going to show you
5

5

00:00:05.430  -->  00:00:08.120
how to install Python on to your machine.
6

6

00:00:08.120  -->  00:00:10.720
Doesn't matter whether you have a Mac
7

7

00:00:10.720  -->  00:00:14.220
or a Windows PC, the process is very similar.
8

8

00:00:14.220  -->  00:00:16.640
So, let's get straight to it.
9

9

00:00:16.640  -->  00:00:18.180
Alright so, first thing as always
10

10

00:00:18.180  -->  00:00:20.220
we're going to need a browser.
11

11

00:00:20.220  -->  00:00:21.280
I'm gonna bring up a browser
12

12

00:00:21.280  -->  00:00:22.720
and what we're going to do is
13

13

00:00:22.720  -->  00:00:24.820
just google for Anaconda Python,
14

14

00:00:24.820  -->  00:00:27.660
that way you won't have to type in the website.
15

15

00:00:27.660  -->  00:00:29.510
Or you can just type in the website if you like.
16

16

00:00:29.510  -->  00:00:34.510
It's continuum, c-o-n-t-i-n-u-u-m dot io slash downloads.
17

17

00:00:36.400  -->  00:00:39.070
And what we're downloading here is Anaconda.
18

18

00:00:39.070  -->  00:00:41.320
The Anaconda distribution for Python.
19

19

00:00:41.320  -->  00:00:44.220
So, let's just go ahead and click the one we want.
20

20

00:00:44.220  -->  00:00:46.380
So, select whichever machine you're on.
21

21

00:00:46.380  -->  00:00:48.630
I'm on Windows, so I'm gonna click Windows here.
22

22

00:00:48.630  -->  00:00:51.000
I'm gonna get the 64 bit installer.
23

23

00:00:51.000  -->  00:00:54.410
And make sure you get Python 3.5 version.
24

24

00:00:54.410  -->  00:00:56.020
Then they're offering a cheat sheet.
25

25

00:00:56.020  -->  00:00:57.660
You can get the cheat sheet if you like.
26

26

00:00:57.660  -->  00:00:58.990
If you want to learn more about Anaconda.
27

27

00:00:58.990  -->  00:00:59.980
But we don't really need it.
28

28

00:00:59.980  -->  00:01:01.840
So, I'm gonna click no thanks.
29

29

00:01:01.840  -->  00:01:03.660
And it's downloading, it's quite large,
30

30

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:05.880
it's 350 megabytes.
31

31

00:01:05.880  -->  00:01:09.670
So, make sure you get Python 3.5 and not Python 2.7.
32

32

00:01:09.670  -->  00:01:12.970
This is a updated version of Python.
33

33

00:01:12.970  -->  00:01:15.440
And while it's downloading, I'm going to explain
34

34

00:01:15.440  -->  00:01:16.860
a little bit what Anaconda is.
35

35

00:01:16.860  -->  00:01:21.860
So, Python like with R, Python is a programming language
36

36

00:01:21.940  -->  00:01:23.000
which you install on to your machine.
37

37

00:01:23.000  -->  00:01:24.790
And then on top of that, you can install
38

38

00:01:24.790  -->  00:01:28.780
different integrated development environments,
39

39

00:01:28.780  -->  00:01:31.940
so IDE's and you can install other,
40

40

00:01:31.940  -->  00:01:33.730
you can add packages on to it.
41

41

00:01:33.730  -->  00:01:36.580
You can do lot's of different modifications.
42

42

00:01:36.580  -->  00:01:40.913
So, just Python by itself is not going to be very useful
43

43

00:01:40.913  -->  00:01:43.950
to you, unless you install an IDE
44

44

00:01:43.950  -->  00:01:47.180
that you're going to work through with Python.
45

45

00:01:47.180  -->  00:01:49.470
And therefor, it's very convenient
46

46

00:01:49.470  -->  00:01:53.590
that Anaconda have or from Continuum Analytics,
47

47

00:01:53.590  -->  00:01:56.630
they have developed this prepackaged solution
48

48

00:01:56.630  -->  00:01:59.210
called Anaconda which installs not only Python
49

49

00:01:59.210  -->  00:02:01.860
but installs a couple of IDE's on to your computer.
50

50

00:02:01.860  -->  00:02:03.920
Installs the most common packages
51

51

00:02:03.920  -->  00:02:07.040
that you might be using like NumPy, Pandas
52

52

00:02:07.040  -->  00:02:08.880
and some others.
53

53

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:10.130
And therefore it's just
54

54

00:02:10.130  -->  00:02:13.850
a very conveniently packaged solution
55

55

00:02:13.850  -->  00:02:15.280
that you can download and install.
56

56

00:02:15.280  -->  00:02:16.760
And that's exactly what we're doing.
57

57

00:02:16.760  -->  00:02:18.250
So, I already have it on my computer.
58

58

00:02:18.250  -->  00:02:20.870
So, I'm gonna actually cancel this installation download.
59

59

00:02:20.870  -->  00:02:22.630
I actually have that download package.
60

60

00:02:22.630  -->  00:02:27.000
And once it's downloaded it, you just need to run it.
61

61

00:02:27.000  -->  00:02:30.320
And whether it's Mac or Windows, it's gonna look similar.
62

62

00:02:30.320  -->  00:02:32.063
And then just go through the installation process.
63

63

00:02:32.063  -->  00:02:33.900
It's gonna ask you where you want to install it,
64

64

00:02:33.900  -->  00:02:37.060
agree to a license, who you want to install it for,
65

65

00:02:37.060  -->  00:02:38.200
where you want to install it to.
66

66

00:02:38.200  -->  00:02:42.600
So, I usually recommend installing into the default folder.
67

67

00:02:42.600  -->  00:02:44.130
And then it'll ask you just a couple of other questions.
68

68

00:02:44.130  -->  00:02:45.863
So, just go through this installation process.
69

69

00:02:45.863  -->  00:02:47.630
It's gonna take a little bit of time
70

70

00:02:47.630  -->  00:02:49.253
because it is a large package.
71

71

00:02:50.140  -->  00:02:52.550
And then when it's done, what you need to do
72

72

00:02:52.550  -->  00:02:54.370
is you need to actually launch it.
73

73

00:02:54.370  -->  00:02:55.360
So, I'm gonna show you now,
74

74

00:02:55.360  -->  00:02:58.860
how to find it on your computer and launch it.
75

75

00:02:58.860  -->  00:03:00.950
So, give me a second.
76

76

00:03:00.950  -->  00:03:03.270
There's my taskbar.
77

77

00:03:03.270  -->  00:03:05.330
So, if you go to taskbar at the bottom.
78

78

00:03:05.330  -->  00:03:07.080
And don't worry about Anaconda Cloud.
79

79

00:03:07.080  -->  00:03:09.940
Just in your search or here, just start typing
80

80

00:03:09.940  -->  00:03:10.883
in anaconda.
81

81

00:03:11.810  -->  00:03:15.700
And here you can see that you've got Anaconda Navigator.
82

82

00:03:15.700  -->  00:03:16.550
That's the one we need.
83

83

00:03:16.550  -->  00:03:20.120
You need to find Anaconda Navigator and launch that.
84

84

00:03:20.120  -->  00:03:23.790
So, that is your aim.
85

85

00:03:23.790  -->  00:03:25.990
And this is gonna take a few seconds to load as well.
86

86

00:03:25.990  -->  00:03:27.480
So, let's give it some time.
87

87

00:03:27.480  -->  00:03:28.630
Alright, so here it is.
88

88

00:03:28.630  -->  00:03:30.410
This is what Anaconda Navigator looks like.
89

89

00:03:30.410  -->  00:03:32.440
I'm gonna expand it to full screen.
90

90

00:03:32.440  -->  00:03:33.890
And here you can see that you've already
91

91

00:03:33.890  -->  00:03:34.980
got quite a few things.
92

92

00:03:34.980  -->  00:03:37.096
It's a very user friendly environment as well.
93

93

00:03:37.096  -->  00:03:39.500
And you can also find it on a Mac.
94

94

00:03:39.500  -->  00:03:40.940
So, not only on a Windows.
95

95

00:03:40.940  -->  00:03:43.190
On a Mac you just go to, so you just need
96

96

00:03:43.190  -->  00:03:45.260
to press command space on a Mac.
97

97

00:03:45.260  -->  00:03:46.690
And that'll bring up the search.
98

98

00:03:46.690  -->  00:03:49.170
And there, just type in anaconda navigator
99

99

00:03:49.170  -->  00:03:52.900
and you will be greeted with a window just like this one.
100

100

00:03:52.900  -->  00:03:54.760
And here you can see that a couple of things
101

101

00:03:54.760  -->  00:03:55.593
are already available.
102

102

00:03:55.593  -->  00:03:58.620
You've got the Jupyter notebooks for example.
103

103

00:03:58.620  -->  00:04:00.470
Qt console and Spyder.
104

104

00:04:00.470  -->  00:04:02.690
And what we're interested in is actually Spyder.
105

105

00:04:02.690  -->  00:04:04.387
So, Spyder's our IDE of choice.
106

106

00:04:04.387  -->  00:04:06.630
So, you can see here powerful Python IDE
107

107

00:04:06.630  -->  00:04:09.300
with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging
108

108

00:04:09.300  -->  00:04:10.970
and introspection features.
109

109

00:04:10.970  -->  00:04:12.510
So, we'll be using all those features
110

110

00:04:12.510  -->  00:04:15.470
but it is going to be our IDE of choice for this course.
111

111

00:04:15.470  -->  00:04:17.640
So, lets go ahead and launch Spyder
112

112

00:04:17.640  -->  00:04:18.790
and have a look inside.
113

113

00:04:19.810  -->  00:04:21.133
So, give it a second.
114

114

00:04:24.300  -->  00:04:25.580
And there is Spyder.
115

115

00:04:25.580  -->  00:04:26.787
So, this is a separate window,
116

116

00:04:26.787  -->  00:04:28.940
you no longer need Anaconda Navigator,
117

117

00:04:28.940  -->  00:04:29.905
you can just close it.
118

118

00:04:29.905  -->  00:04:31.270
Don't show again.
119

119

00:04:31.270  -->  00:04:32.500
Yes.
120

120

00:04:32.500  -->  00:04:37.020
There is Spyder, and this is our IDE.
121

121

00:04:37.020  -->  00:04:39.400
And if you're launching this on Mac,
122

122

00:04:39.400  -->  00:04:41.150
you might not see all of these windows.
123

123

00:04:41.150  -->  00:04:43.693
On a Mac, it might look something,
124

124

00:04:45.090  -->  00:04:46.680
give me a second, let me close all of this.
125

125

00:04:46.680  -->  00:04:49.700
Looks something like this, like empty.
126

126

00:04:49.700  -->  00:04:53.290
So, to bring up your panes, you go to View, Panes
127

127

00:04:53.290  -->  00:04:55.640
and then you need Editor for sure.
128

128

00:04:55.640  -->  00:04:58.300
Then you don't need Console, so don't bring up Console.
129

129

00:04:58.300  -->  00:04:59.950
Because you need the IPython console,
130

130

00:04:59.950  -->  00:05:02.500
it's more advanced and it's what
131

131

00:05:02.500  -->  00:05:04.270
we're going to be using in this course.
132

132

00:05:04.270  -->  00:05:07.420
Then you will need a variable explorer
133

133

00:05:07.420  -->  00:05:11.240
and then you will also need object inspector.
134

134

00:05:11.240  -->  00:05:13.270
So, and if you need any other ones.
135

135

00:05:13.270  -->  00:05:14.850
So, if you find that throughout the course
136

136

00:05:14.850  -->  00:05:17.630
we're using something else like maybe File Explorer.
137

137

00:05:17.630  -->  00:05:18.890
Something through out of these,
138

138

00:05:18.890  -->  00:05:20.550
you can always just add them on from here.
139

139

00:05:20.550  -->  00:05:22.120
So, you'll be able to quickly
140

140

00:05:22.120  -->  00:05:24.530
add them like that, no problems.
141

141

00:05:24.530  -->  00:05:26.760
So, just if you find that you don't have a tab
142

142

00:05:26.760  -->  00:05:31.340
that we're using, just go to View, Panes and add it in.
143

143

00:05:31.340  -->  00:05:33.730
Alright, so that's how you get the panes.
144

144

00:05:33.730  -->  00:05:37.120
And I'm just gonna remove that line for now.
145

145

00:05:37.120  -->  00:05:39.980
And now, what we want to do is also
146

146

00:05:39.980  -->  00:05:42.930
I want to show you how to customize the view.
147

147

00:05:42.930  -->  00:05:46.320
Now you can see right away that the font here is very small.
148

148

00:05:46.320  -->  00:05:48.030
And you might want to increase it.
149

149

00:05:48.030  -->  00:05:49.530
We'll definitely increase it for this course.
150

150

00:05:49.530  -->  00:05:51.110
So, you can see it better.
151

151

00:05:51.110  -->  00:05:52.370
But if you want to increase it on your own machine,
152

152

00:05:52.370  -->  00:05:55.700
just go to Preferences and then on the left find Editor.
153

153

00:05:55.700  -->  00:05:58.650
So, this is your editor and here you can increase the font,
154

154

00:05:58.650  -->  00:06:00.510
you can even change the font style,
155

155

00:06:00.510  -->  00:06:02.940
and just maybe increase it to 14 or something.
156

156

00:06:02.940  -->  00:06:04.400
So, you can see it's increasing
157

157

00:06:04.400  -->  00:06:05.933
in size very nicely like that.
158

158

00:06:06.848  -->  00:06:08.330
And then, you can also make it darker.
159

159

00:06:08.330  -->  00:06:12.400
So, if you want for instance, if it's better for your eyes,
160

160

00:06:12.400  -->  00:06:14.820
or you're working at night, this might be too bright.
161

161

00:06:14.820  -->  00:06:17.020
Very easy, just over here select
162

162

00:06:17.020  -->  00:06:18.400
the color scheme that you want.
163

163

00:06:18.400  -->  00:06:21.050
For instance, let's say Spyder Dark.
164

164

00:06:21.050  -->  00:06:23.040
And there you go, it's now dark.
165

165

00:06:23.040  -->  00:06:24.450
So, it's totally up to you.
166

166

00:06:24.450  -->  00:06:27.180
I'm just gonna bring it back to the normal Spyder.
167

167

00:06:27.180  -->  00:06:28.220
These are a couple of other options.
168

168

00:06:28.220  -->  00:06:30.160
You can even create your own options.
169

169

00:06:30.160  -->  00:06:31.770
You can just go to syntax coloring
170

170

00:06:31.770  -->  00:06:35.010
and then you can adjust them here
171

171

00:06:35.010  -->  00:06:37.090
to your preferences.
172

172

00:06:37.090  -->  00:06:41.280
Okay, so, that's how we set up our console
173

173

00:06:41.280  -->  00:06:45.830
or our IDE, and also actually you can change
174

174

00:06:45.830  -->  00:06:47.570
in the console, or IPython console
175

175

00:06:47.570  -->  00:06:49.660
you can change the font size here as well.
176

176

00:06:49.660  -->  00:06:51.100
So, for instance, you can just go
177

177

00:06:51.100  -->  00:06:53.660
and set it to 14 or something else
178

178

00:06:53.660  -->  00:06:55.570
if you want to increase the font size as well here.
179

179

00:06:55.570  -->  00:06:59.369
So, you can find those other windows as well.
180

180

00:06:59.369  -->  00:07:00.790
And now, just to finish off we're
181

181

00:07:00.790  -->  00:07:02.300
gonna type in our first program.
182

182

00:07:02.300  -->  00:07:04.890
We're going to say print and then in brackets
183

183

00:07:04.890  -->  00:07:07.150
we're gonna say, in quotation marks,
184

184

00:07:07.150  -->  00:07:10.050
Hello World exclamation mark.
185

185

00:07:10.050  -->  00:07:11.200
And now, we're gonna highlight everything
186

186

00:07:11.200  -->  00:07:13.280
and press Control Enter on our keyboard
187

187

00:07:13.280  -->  00:07:14.662
or Command Return on a Mac.
188

188

00:07:14.662  -->  00:07:16.210
If you press that, then you
189

189

00:07:16.210  -->  00:07:18.480
can see that that line has been copied into the console
190

190

00:07:18.480  -->  00:07:19.530
and has been run.
191

191

00:07:19.530  -->  00:07:22.240
And we've printed our first phrase Hello World.
192

192

00:07:22.240  -->  00:07:24.150
Congratulations you've just installed
193

193

00:07:24.150  -->  00:07:25.480
Python on to your machine.
194

194

00:07:25.480  -->  00:07:27.323
And you're ready to proceed with the course.
