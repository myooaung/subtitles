00:00:00,610  -->  00:00:01,640
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:01,640  -->  00:00:03,200
to the course on deep learning.
3

3

00:00:03,200  -->  00:00:05,600
Today we're gonna have an even quicker tutorial
4

4

00:00:05,600  -->  00:00:06,640
than last time.
5

5

00:00:06,640  -->  00:00:08,880
We're gonna talk about Deep Boltzmann Machines.
6

6

00:00:08,880  -->  00:00:11,550
And this is another topic, just like the DBNs,
7

7

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:12,700
or deep belief networks,
8

8

00:00:12,700  -->  00:00:15,320
is another very, very advanced topic
9

9

00:00:15,320  -->  00:00:18,510
and it is definitely out of the,
10

10

00:00:18,510  -->  00:00:21,240
way out of the scope of this course,
11

11

00:00:21,240  -->  00:00:24,130
but at the same time we felt that it's important
12

12

00:00:24,130  -->  00:00:27,010
for us to at least mention these two topics
13

13

00:00:27,010  -->  00:00:28,990
so that you know what they are
14

14

00:00:28,990  -->  00:00:30,680
and you're aware of these things
15

15

00:00:30,680  -->  00:00:33,820
and that if you feel like you need to delve deeper
16

16

00:00:33,820  -->  00:00:36,760
into either deep belief networks or Deep Boltzmann Machines
17

17

00:00:36,760  -->  00:00:39,420
then you know where to find the right materials then.
18

18

00:00:39,420  -->  00:00:40,460
You know where to start.
19

19

00:00:40,460  -->  00:00:42,370
So the first thing, and the most important thing
20

20

00:00:42,370  -->  00:00:44,000
I wanted to point out is that
21

21

00:00:44,000  -->  00:00:46,810
deep belief networks are not the same
22

22

00:00:46,810  -->  00:00:48,530
as Deep Boltzmann Machines.
23

23

00:00:48,530  -->  00:00:51,030
You might come across these terms sometime
24

24

00:00:51,030  -->  00:00:53,210
and just important to keep them separate,
25

25

00:00:53,210  -->  00:00:54,990
understand what the differences are,
26

26

00:00:54,990  -->  00:00:56,470
or what the main difference is,
27

27

00:00:56,470  -->  00:00:58,930
so that you know which one you're talking about
28

28

00:00:58,930  -->  00:01:00,710
or which one you're dealing with.
29

29

00:01:00,710  -->  00:01:03,140
So here we've got a deep belief network
30

30

00:01:03,140  -->  00:01:05,140
as you remember from the previous tutorial,
31

31

00:01:05,140  -->  00:01:09,060
so stacked RBMs, and then after the training has happened,
32

32

00:01:09,060  -->  00:01:12,011
you make sure that all of your layers,
33

33

00:01:12,011  -->  00:01:14,490
except for the top two, are directed layers
34

34

00:01:14,490  -->  00:01:16,560
or the connections between them are directed.
35

35

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:19,690
Well in Deep Boltzmann Machine, you don't have that.
36

36

00:01:19,690  -->  00:01:22,960
You don't need to, well actually you just don't
37

37

00:01:22,960  -->  00:01:26,550
deprive the network of the undirectedness
38

38

00:01:26,550  -->  00:01:27,760
of its connections.
39

39

00:01:27,760  -->  00:01:29,290
And therefore, this is what a
40

40

00:01:29,290  -->  00:01:31,290
Deep Boltzmann Machine looks like.
41

41

00:01:31,290  -->  00:01:34,180
And that's kind of the main difference,
42

42

00:01:34,180  -->  00:01:36,770
it's the main architectural difference between the two.
43

43

00:01:36,770  -->  00:01:38,370
There's a great paper,
44

44

00:01:38,370  -->  00:01:40,298
which we're going to direct you towards
45

45

00:01:40,298  -->  00:01:43,000
in terms of Deep Boltzmann Machines.
46

46

00:01:43,000  -->  00:01:44,670
It's called Deep Boltzmann Machines
47

47

00:01:44,670  -->  00:01:46,767
by Rusian Salakhutdinov.
48

48

00:01:46,767  -->  00:01:49,890
I think it's 2009, couldn't determine the exact date.
49

49

00:01:49,890  -->  00:01:52,630
But the good news is that this paper was written
50

50

00:01:52,630  -->  00:01:54,120
together with Jeffrey Hinton,
51

51

00:01:54,120  -->  00:01:55,430
who's the second author on this paper.
52

52

00:01:55,430  -->  00:01:58,550
So that's always a good thing that Jeffrey Hinton
53

53

00:01:58,550  -->  00:02:02,680
is part of a paper and Ruslan actually has
54

54

00:02:02,680  -->  00:02:04,880
quite few papers on Boltzmann Machines
55

55

00:02:04,880  -->  00:02:06,140
and RBMs and stuff like that.
56

56

00:02:06,140  -->  00:02:09,150
So these are two people who know what they're talking about.
57

57

00:02:09,150  -->  00:02:11,380
Here you've got actually two examples on the image,
58

58

00:02:11,380  -->  00:02:13,860
deep belief network and Deep Boltzmann Machine.
59

59

00:02:13,860  -->  00:02:17,670
The main thing that if you're curious about
60

60

00:02:17,670  -->  00:02:20,560
what's the difference in terms of application,
61

61

00:02:20,560  -->  00:02:23,340
well it is speculated that Deep Boltzmann Machines
62

62

00:02:23,340  -->  00:02:27,383
actually can extract features
63

63

00:02:27,383  -->  00:02:30,020
that are more sophisticated, more complex,
64

64

00:02:30,020  -->  00:02:33,570
and therefore they could potentially be used
65

65

00:02:33,570  -->  00:02:35,390
for more complex tasks.
66

66

00:02:35,390  -->  00:02:38,260
So that's a very short breakdown.
67

67

00:02:38,260  -->  00:02:39,460
If you'd like to learn more,
68

68

00:02:39,460  -->  00:02:41,270
then this is a good place to start.
69

69

00:02:41,270  -->  00:02:43,050
Again this is a very advanced topic
70

70

00:02:43,050  -->  00:02:45,050
and we're not going to delve into it here,
71

71

00:02:45,050  -->  00:02:48,830
but if you'd like to look into Deep Boltzmann Machines
72

72

00:02:48,830  -->  00:02:50,620
a bit further, than this paper
73

73

00:02:50,620  -->  00:02:53,300
is a good place to get started on that.
74

74

00:02:53,300  -->  00:02:54,940
And I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial
75

75

00:02:54,940  -->  00:02:56,990
and until next time, enjoy deep learning.
