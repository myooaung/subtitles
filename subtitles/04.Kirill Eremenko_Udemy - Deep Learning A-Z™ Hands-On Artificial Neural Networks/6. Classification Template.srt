00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:02,530
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome to this Python tutorial.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,530  -->  00:00:04,530
So, this is not exactly a Python tutorial,
3

3

00:00:04,530  -->  00:00:06,450
because what we'll do in this tutorial
4

4

00:00:06,450  -->  00:00:09,140
is just to make a classification template.
5

5

00:00:09,140  -->  00:00:10,080
And we're doing this
6

6

00:00:10,080  -->  00:00:12,560
because the future classification models
7

7

00:00:12,560  -->  00:00:13,820
that we're going to build.
8

8

00:00:13,820  -->  00:00:16,150
Are going to be built much more efficiently
9

9

00:00:16,150  -->  00:00:17,970
thanks to this template we are making
10

10

00:00:17,970  -->  00:00:19,130
in this tutorial.
11

11

00:00:19,130  -->  00:00:20,320
And we will make this template
12

12

00:00:20,320  -->  00:00:22,670
from our Logistic Regression model
13

13

00:00:22,670  -->  00:00:23,840
because as you can noticed
14

14

00:00:23,840  -->  00:00:25,330
in this model that we just built
15

15

00:00:25,330  -->  00:00:26,270
in this section.
16

16

00:00:26,270  -->  00:00:28,100
Well, the only time that we code
17

17

00:00:28,100  -->  00:00:30,690
something about Logistic Regression specifically.
18

18

00:00:30,690  -->  00:00:32,610
Is just in this section.
19

19

00:00:32,610  -->  00:00:35,040
Indeed the rest is purely generalized,
20

20

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:37,510
for example when we predict the Test set result
21

21

00:00:37,510  -->  00:00:39,780
we don't use use any class or function specific
22

22

00:00:39,780  -->  00:00:41,230
to the Logistic Regression.
23

23

00:00:41,230  -->  00:00:42,700
We used this classifier here,
24

24

00:00:42,700  -->  00:00:45,660
which is indeed the classifier of Logistic Regression
25

25

00:00:45,660  -->  00:00:47,120
but what we'll do in the next sections
26

26

00:00:47,120  -->  00:00:49,500
when we build other classification models.
27

27

00:00:49,500  -->  00:00:51,720
Will be to only to import a new class
28

28

00:00:51,720  -->  00:00:53,160
that will be the required class
29

29

00:00:53,160  -->  00:00:54,860
to build our future classification models.
30

30

00:00:54,860  -->  00:00:57,150
And then we will call this class here
31

31

00:00:57,150  -->  00:00:59,280
to create our classifier object
32

32

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:01,260
which we will still call classifier.
33

33

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:03,110
And then we will use the fit method.
34

34

00:01:03,110  -->  00:01:04,900
But that's the only part of the whole code
35

35

00:01:04,900  -->  00:01:07,220
where we talk specifically about the model.
36

36

00:01:07,220  -->  00:01:09,630
Nowhere else in the code has something specific
37

37

00:01:09,630  -->  00:01:11,150
to Logistic Regression.
38

38

00:01:11,150  -->  00:01:12,890
For example, here I don't use anything
39

39

00:01:12,890  -->  00:01:14,140
about Logistic Regression.
40

40

00:01:14,140  -->  00:01:16,200
I only use the classifier here
41

41

00:01:16,200  -->  00:01:19,190
but our future models will be called classifier as well
42

42

00:01:19,190  -->  00:01:21,620
and same for this last section here.
43

43

00:01:21,620  -->  00:01:24,010
I don't talk about Logistic Regression
44

44

00:01:24,010  -->  00:01:25,600
I don't code anything specific
45

45

00:01:25,600  -->  00:01:26,940
to Logistic Regression,
46

46

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:28,870
only this classifier here.
47

47

00:01:28,870  -->  00:01:30,980
So that's why it's really easy for us
48

48

00:01:30,980  -->  00:01:33,100
to make a template for the future models
49

49

00:01:33,100  -->  00:01:34,850
and that's why we will be so efficient
50

50

00:01:34,850  -->  00:01:37,560
at creating the future classification models.
51

51

00:01:37,560  -->  00:01:39,810
Thanks to this specific template.
52

52

00:01:39,810  -->  00:01:41,190
So lets make the template!
53

53

00:01:41,190  -->  00:01:44,490
We will actually take everything from here
54

54

00:01:44,490  -->  00:01:45,960
to the bottom,
55

55

00:01:45,960  -->  00:01:48,311
copy and
56

56

00:01:48,311  -->  00:01:50,020
paste it here.
57

57

00:01:50,020  -->  00:01:51,300
And now what we have to do,
58

58

00:01:51,300  -->  00:01:55,250
is only to remove this part of the code here
59

59

00:01:55,250  -->  00:01:58,710
because this is specific to the Logistic Regression model.
60

60

00:01:58,710  -->  00:02:00,440
So we will remove this section
61

61

00:02:00,440  -->  00:02:03,260
and replace it by a comment
62

62

00:02:03,260  -->  00:02:06,440
to specify that we need to create
63

63

00:02:07,700  -->  00:02:09,230
our classifier
64

64

00:02:10,480  -->  00:02:11,690
right here.
65

65

00:02:11,690  -->  00:02:14,100
And then you know we can generalize even more
66

66

00:02:14,100  -->  00:02:16,730
by replacing Logistic Regression in the title
67

67

00:02:16,730  -->  00:02:19,423
of this section here by the classifier.
68

68

00:02:20,710  -->  00:02:23,430
Alright, and actually that's all
69

69

00:02:23,430  -->  00:02:25,280
our template for classification
70

70

00:02:25,280  -->  00:02:27,690
is ready to build very efficiently
71

71

00:02:27,690  -->  00:02:29,270
any new classification model.
72

72

00:02:29,270  -->  00:02:31,600
And you will see that in the next sections,
73

73

00:02:31,600  -->  00:02:34,170
you will see how we will only have to
74

74

00:02:34,170  -->  00:02:37,210
create our classifier here and we will be ready
75

75

00:02:37,210  -->  00:02:39,040
to make the prediction,
76

76

00:02:39,040  -->  00:02:40,880
visualize the Training set results
77

77

00:02:40,880  -->  00:02:42,930
and visualize the Test set results.
78

78

00:02:42,930  -->  00:02:44,740
So, actually speaking about that
79

79

00:02:44,740  -->  00:02:47,580
lets recap about what this template is doing.
80

80

00:02:47,580  -->  00:02:50,180
So, in the first section we import the libraries
81

81

00:02:50,180  -->  00:02:52,150
NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.
82

82

00:02:52,150  -->  00:02:53,650
In the second section we import
83

83

00:02:53,650  -->  00:02:57,000
the dataset, our Social Network Ads dataset.
84

84

00:02:57,000  -->  00:02:59,080
Then in the third section we split the datasets
85

85

00:02:59,080  -->  00:03:01,620
into the Training set and the Test set.
86

86

00:03:01,620  -->  00:03:03,330
Then in the next section we have this code
87

87

00:03:03,330  -->  00:03:06,090
to apply Feature Scaling, if we need to.
88

88

00:03:06,090  -->  00:03:08,110
Then this is the new section that we create
89

89

00:03:08,110  -->  00:03:11,160
our classifier and then once our classifier is created
90

90

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:13,360
we predict the Test set results.
91

91

00:03:13,360  -->  00:03:15,210
Then we made a Confusion Matrix
92

92

00:03:15,210  -->  00:03:16,350
and then my favorite part,
93

93

00:03:16,350  -->  00:03:18,380
we visualized the Training set results
94

94

00:03:18,380  -->  00:03:20,870
and same as for the Test set results
95

95

00:03:20,870  -->  00:03:23,130
that we will also visualize.
96

96

00:03:23,130  -->  00:03:24,220
To make sure that we don't
97

97

00:03:24,220  -->  00:03:27,330
have any overfilling and that performance of our model
98

98

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:29,840
is still good on new observations.
99

99

00:03:29,840  -->  00:03:31,390
So, here we are!
100

100

00:03:31,390  -->  00:03:33,360
Ready to build new classification models
101

101

00:03:33,360  -->  00:03:35,690
very efficiently, I look forward to creating
102

102

00:03:35,690  -->  00:03:36,860
these new models with you.
103

103

00:03:36,860  -->  00:03:38,913
And until then, enjoy Machine Learning!
