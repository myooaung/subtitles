00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
Hello,

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.830
dear guys,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.180
I'm Payment Sadhu,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.160
the teacher off these foolish of education.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.620
I'm gonna show you how to design the logo off a company of the first.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.610
Our work will be finished.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.020
Actually,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.200
by designing your side of that company to support a customer completely.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.420
As you see,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.650
we prepared a logo on the screen.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.660
Uh,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.080
actually,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.600
the term of it is PS that he's contracted form of my own name payments.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.110
Sadow.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.800
It is both two dimensional and three dimensional foreign is that you can see two

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.600
dimensional one on the left side and three dimensional one.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.770
He's on the right side,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.460
as you see,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.820
actually worked with three D menu to create a three dimensional logo,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.400
and we learn how to change a two dimensional logo into three dimensional logo.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.550
Uh,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.200
actually,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.340
it is so simple,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.390
although we can do it and no need to be worried about it because you see so simple.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.190
And somehow it is a high deal.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.530
So I'll show you the basic longer after some seconds that we're gonna use it in the spark

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.790
and the first of our education to teach completely in order to design second,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.490
like in black and widest.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.010
Heil.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.720
We could have gone on Adobe Illustrator menu.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.100
As you see,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.080
the logo on our screen is here.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.370
On the name of it is PS is the contraction off payments set up And the little PS is a

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.350
contraction for more footage.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.380
Ship we had least to deed logo,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.880
which is colorless and has no style on it,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.490
has just been designed.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.790
You see some yellow circles on the rights like to,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.810
and I will mention about them at the end of our work,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.020
actually use them to test our work.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.400
Although we design our work as a centerboard.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.140
But finally,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.550
we should use them to test thickness off all sides of our work and the parts to show us.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.210
Actually,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.490
we do.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.420
It actually shows a beautiful project.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.430
Usually we consider a circle with special nominations on well copied for the next parts.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.980
And you see,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.920
I'll put some of them here or here.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.850
See,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.450
the circles will be fit.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.450
Mm.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.310
They will fit here.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.500
That said it.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350
Yes,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.380
approximately.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.350
It is fit.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.650
Uh,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.210
and you can try them,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.230
uh,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.480
on different ports to see they feed with all the parts.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.970
And it states that we have design a logo completely send Erred Yes.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.020
And how to design the Sligo.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.290
We're not going to learn all the points off,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.020
illustrator,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.430
and I'm gonna explain about some necessary tools to desire these logo and second life

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.630
completely and professionally,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.140
believe me,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.660
and you'll be able to do it by these education of these intended tools and your own

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.590
creativity.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.250
And don't be worried about it.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.210
You can achieve it after some mounts.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.270
Don't be worried about it.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.570
All the older designers will be faced with their,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.150
uh,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.080
allow creativity and Lao amount of ideas at the beginning.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.670
And it's a general problem.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.650
And it's not just for you.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.600
Don't worry.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.210
When you see the work work samples over experience designers,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.580
your mind will be often and that your tax will be better on.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.250
You'll achieve creativity automatically.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.980
I want to start a education.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.790
I,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.620
when I start educating right now,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.900
do not contain marginal conversations.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.470
See,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.330
the tool box of Illustrator software has some tools,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.610
like photo shop software.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.050
But even mawr endear more various sea.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.140
Some of the more a Samos,

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.990
each order and some of the others.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.430
I mean,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.950
some others are different from each other and are especially referred to add a B plus a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.960
reader software one of the seminar to lease these shaped tool that he's now by a rectangle

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.570
tool.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.320
On the 2nd 1 is rounded rectangle tool that you see on the screen.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.980
We use the first tool to create a desired shape.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.150
I mean intended shape,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.040
which can be visually size.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.850
Or you can mention the diamond nations.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.380
Um,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.270
mathematically,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.810
See if I drag here right over here,

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.670
I'll have ah rectangle,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.080
which has been created visually.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.150
And if ah,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.940
I click left on the screen when my tool has activated,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.050
I mean has been activated by myself.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:21.120
I can use numbers to measure by millimeters or somehow centimeters or meant meters,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.850
uh,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.700
mathematically to design a rectangle.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.350
Now,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.270
I just created a candle usual here.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.770
I can feed it to get out.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.150
Put more similar to it,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.260
as you see in the right side,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.530
off the monitor.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.380
Uh,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.850
see,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:49.700
at first I might say that I used the 2018 version off a lesser your software and one of the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.950
windows has been dilated on the top.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:53.930
Obor.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.490
Yes.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.130
One of the windows has been diluted on the top four you can use essential or a classic

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.100
essential.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.650
Uh,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.140
I actually classic essentially is approximately,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.550
like,

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.690
traditional style.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:12.420
And you can consider these setting bore on the talk here the near essential which has bean

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.170
designing these south Where,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.210
uh,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.750
actually you must consider the top or immediate,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.620
and it mentioned the use full hearts in the properties panel and see if you don't have

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.070
properties panel here,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:34.200
you can click on the window menu to choose and activated the coordinates Off Peaks Andy,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.680
Greg,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.260
I mean,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.020
why are specified?

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.520
And the dimensions are specified by millimeter actually ratios than we usually,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.250
but we can make it more exact.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.380
I can change in nine point 56/1000 to 9.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.750
This was about height.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.360
Now,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360
about white.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.800
I mean weeks.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.650
I can set it up 37 to have a round number.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.050
Okay,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.430
I just did it to have around number.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.550
We'll deal with order ports later,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.650
and we should step on these smart well,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.750
uh,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.130
to Islam.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.950
These line over here that are ages has been astound this land to the beat.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:32.050
We should use a sheer tool that is one of the special tools off illustrator software to

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.200
slam the edges,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.950
like as I did before.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.350
Okay.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.000
It's a kind of necessary tool.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.700
Yes,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.470
you have two ways.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:42.700
I mean,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.480
two choices.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.660
One of these that to click twice.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:45.880
I mean,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.870
double click on these.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:53.310
Tool to open a panel which leads you to regulate and angle to set tittle around this angle

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:53.310
.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.380
Uh,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.300
for example,

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.230
if I said it up 45 neither 19 nor zero gas 45.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.940
It will give me the intended A style which is here.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.760
And you see,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.620
I click on OK,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.580
sorry.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.830
I must choose it.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.330
At the first I stepped on these part.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.150
I'll order 45 then I'll confirm it.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:23.800
The desired number was set exactly here around that axis.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.250
But you have another shows.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.360
When you choose the stool,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.410
you can click right to drag a rectangle.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:31.870
I mean,

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.630
the object which was choosing and using the choice mode.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.550
Yes,

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.030
it will be changed by how much you drag it.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:44.750
And it is showing you a number based on degree C just like these.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.630
Remember the No Marie's based on the degree.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.380
Okay.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.250
Remember that?

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:55.950
Seem so I choose least exactly.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.440
I set it up 45.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.120
And you can click on preview to see how the shade will be created.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.180
If you click on copy,

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.710
you'll have a copy of it with the same style.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.250
And it will keep the basic aside for you.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.130
Yes,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.060
we keep the basic shape to use it in necessary parts.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.670
Well,

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.540
now we want to design its cemetery.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.060
As the model shows we have here to do it.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.260
We should just click on object.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.390
Yes.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.710
Uh,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.250
just click on the object.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.620
Uh,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.450
the Macintosh operating system has command instead of control,

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:48.220
and we use shift command old and the and in Windows operating system.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.000
Actually,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.160
we use Chief command Control D OK,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.760
other first.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.100
We could weaken it toe open,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.630
transfer each panel.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:03.450
There are lots offsetting icons in these panel and you can click on preview to see exactly

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:03.450
.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.230
We can set horizontal in the scale part.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:15.720
It's assumption is 100% and we dragged right means that we're gonna add its length.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.640
For example,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.720
we add 85%.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.730
You have nothing to do with this right now.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.140
Actually,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.340
the park vertical is the same as the last one,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.380
and these are simple.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.910
And these vertical are used to move the shape.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.240
And as you see,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.010
we have the ward move here.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.600
Actually,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.160
we use it to move the shape on.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.660
We said it as zero angle is used to rotate it.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.890
And as you know,

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.210
it will be related by the degree.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.050
Yes,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.350
by the degree you said,

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.830
actually,

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:46.410
and actually,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.270
we have nothing to do with these right now.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.770
And these part,

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.040
I mean options.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.260
We can use the reflect ekes and why See,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.940
reflect peaks and why,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.090
Yes.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:58.580
See,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:06.260
we can recently style around the horizontal and vertical and exactly around the peaks.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.540
And why access?

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.110
And it invades our shape Exactly what we want.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.020
We could look on these on.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.480
Duh.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:20.120
Then we could have calmed the copy icon as he Actually,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.260
this work causes a copy off last shape for us.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.250
And I used left,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:26.950
right?

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.200
I mean,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.060
I mean,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.310
I used left right up and down.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.620
I mean,

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.500
arrow keys,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.060
plus shift key to move it.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.630
Yes.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.570
If you don't use chief button,

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.640
I mean key.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.850
The speed of movement will be very allow,

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.540
somehow very slow.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.320
And if you do,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.850
it will be moved fast.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.600
An innocent of,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.340
uh,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.350
arrow cheese.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.630
I mean,

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.650
the way I said,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:12:00.470
you can actually use shift key and drag the most to set it.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.110
No,

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.190
actually,

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.370
to say on a constant line.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.910
And if we don't use shift key,

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.450
we can said it freely without any bays.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.440
But when you use a shift,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:15.720
I mean,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.630
when you click on Chief means you won't let your object be out of the basic line.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.180
So we did it.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:28.090
We did it somehow and created two parts of these objects can click on all key and keep it a

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:33.650
second to copy the shape in illustrator and 30 shops software.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.180
And actually,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:43.550
you see that the style of our move tool will be changed into two icons.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.960
Yes,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.390
into two icons on each other.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.580
Actually,

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.000
yes.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.210
And it states that it is going to create a copy of our object.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.990
And actually,

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.920
we do it.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.450
Yeah,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.950
we can keep shift to set it down on a basic line.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.800
Yes.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:08.350
And we can relate it easily by shift key.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.610
And,

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.150
uh,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.750
we said it at the middle.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.100
Yes,

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.940
just like these.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.870
If you chair,

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.080
you'll see the sign.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.590
Multiplication?

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.170
Yes,

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.030
it is at the middle of my object and it really shone.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.050
When I move,

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:32.140
I said these sign here that he's a suitable place for it.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.650
Yeah,

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.090
right over here.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.750
Well,

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.260
I could design base P.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.100
Yes,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.810
I could design the base p two now to deal with the additional import.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:45.790
If you Carol,

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:51.130
you'll see capacity of my objects pale when they fall on each order,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.130
they'll create some shapes,

00:13:53.130 --> 00:14:00.640
like as you see a triangle here I choose all three of my objects and I'll said the capacity

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.190
as 100 actually,

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.130
that has been set as,

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.360
ah 87 by in music before.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.830
Now all of my objects are bold.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.850
Now we deal with some parts.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.500
As you see,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:22.130
the height is lower and we can drag that beat offer.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.940
Actually,

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.190
it is desired,

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:32.060
and you can move it up and down how you want to create and reach what you lie,

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.790
who usually now I use my direct selection tool,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.700
or I can press a key on keyboard to select it,

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.680
and it leads you to many.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.720
Is your object point to point?

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.680
Actually,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.410
it leads you to change the size and shape.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.100
Well,

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.610
uh,

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.560
it's just enough to keep these two points.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.050
Yes.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:00.640
It's just enough to keep these two points by shift key.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.250
I mean,

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.960
I click on these point at the first,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.200
I keep pressing shift key,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.560
and I'll click on the second point.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.340
Now,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.080
I keep pressing shifty too.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.550
I keep pressing shift key at the same time,

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.830
and I'll bring these two ponies down.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.800
How much I like it is desire.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.280
Now,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.150
I just I like these point,

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.350
which is remained.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.960
I dragged the most from the outside of it,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.810
and I actually said it here.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.710
Now,

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:30.550
As you see,

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:35.040
we created a part of the p of our logo.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.630
Yes.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.350
Well,

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.870
now,

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.500
to design a lower port,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.200
I use V Tool.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.900
Yes.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.720
See our selection tools?

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.280
Yes.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.240
Or actually,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.550
it is tool movement that I just call it move.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.410
Uh,

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.010
just just call it movin.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.250
Funny shop software.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:00.520
When a killer gonna be these tools will be activated.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.700
Choose the object by old key.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.750
You can have a copy of it,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.280
or you can use control,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.430
see or control we.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:17.290
There is no difference between them and a related around the axis.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.220
Okay,

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:18.400
Bye.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:18.920
Shifty,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.650
actually.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:24.440
And I said it exactly when I must said it Just as you see,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.930
just if you care,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.960
you'll see that some slide rule is I mean,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.150
some rulers,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.020
Armagh,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.380
mentally guidance,

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.920
uh,

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:42.200
actually are being activated for mean on their cold as a smart guidance is too.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.260
I don't know that is being activated on your operating system or not.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.130
Actually,

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.330
assumption is active on illustrator,

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.080
But if you doing have it,

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:01.070
you can use the human you and actually click on smart guides here,

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.150
Uh,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.970
click on it,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.400
command you or control you in Windows operating system.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.200
Or if you want to hide other guys,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.350
you can click on height guys option.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.910
Or if you want to look the rulers,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.260
I mean slide rules.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:30.680
You can use a lot guys here because were you at the ruler and select an object on a ruler

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.410
Ruler will have the selection mood,

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:39.670
and it will be moved by moving the object in Illustrator.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:46.460
Contrary to finish up so you can click on lock guide in view menu to not select the ruler

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.840
when you say like the object.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.140
And actually you can't move it at that time,

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.570
and it depends on you.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.990
Uh,

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.040
I don't wanna use the the guides now,

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.870
actually.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.510
Well,

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.160
it depends on you.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.550
I don't want to use the guides right now.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.780
So now I said them unlock.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.250
And by choosing,

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.270
dragging and pressing the delete key,

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.050
I mean it.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:20.380
Now we should check these two diagonal lines to see that or the lines in.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.660
Parallel or not,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.730
I choose it by pressing old key.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.970
Then I'll copied.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:32.380
I'll magnify these object from both sides by pressing old and shift key at the same time.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:32.880
Actually,

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.280
yes,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.050
I will magnify it to cover these on.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.030
I see that my work is a beat in perfect,

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.590
and they're not in parallel completely.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.950
I use 80 to do these,

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:51.610
and I should activate my direct selection tool and I selling these two points which are out

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.480
over here,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.450
See?

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.320
Yes.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.700
By pressing shift and arrow keys.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.640
Uh,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.810
it is better to not use shift key.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.270
It is been cut a lot.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.540
I'd like to say shift on Darrow case,

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.480
but now my eyes stayed That it's OK right now.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.960
I use a V shirt.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.100
Car tool to activate move Tool.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.640
I said it here.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.620
It still has a little problem.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.860
This is style is good.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.880
Somehow,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.590
Yes.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.180
Uh,

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.930
If we want to care a lot about it,

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.970
we should move.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.940
It left just a bit and approximately.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.350
Dave imbalanced.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.460
We don't need these object anymore.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:35.830
Yes,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.010
we don't need these object anymore,

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.900
so we delete it.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:39.980
Well,

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.360
actually deluded.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:41.730
Yes.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.220
Well,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.960
we could design the p up to here somehow.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.270
We did Well,

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.730
actually,

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.140
yes.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:53.550
We should design a triangle and a foundation for eight to create neck sport.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.930
It's too easy again.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.480
We can use,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.030
uh,

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.250
Lisa style to design the foundation.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.350
Ah,

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.800
we related by pressing shift key.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.560
And,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.160
uh,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.910
actually,

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.860
here is a good place to set it.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.570
Yes,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.160
I should delete a part of it.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.240
Yes,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.730
I should delete a part of it.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.370
Here is a good place.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.980
I should did it.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.880
A part of it.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.030
Two blends the line here.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.960
I can lower it this point down by pressing shifty.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:37.580
And my smart guys show that they've been set or we can use an other way to do that.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.220
Of course,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.550
you need to know about illustrator enough.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.990
And if you don't,

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.950
it will be difficult for you.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:52.240
You can activate your re candle tool to use a rectangle or score can drag it up to here.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.270
See,

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.950
uh,

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.640
exactly.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.260
Here.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.630
Yes,

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.950
exactly up to these police that I show you.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:07.260
I drag it from outside to set a square or rectangle like these.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.170
Now,

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.200
uh,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.800
when we choose both of these two objects and if I click on these icon,

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:21.480
it will take the first rectangle from the 2nd 1 Onda.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.750
Actually,

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:28.530
it will substrate act it somehow in finish up.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.020
Yes,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.480
it will sub stacked it in Finnish ups after I do it for you to know.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.580
How is it?

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.930
See the first rectangle?

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:37.210
I mean,

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.660
the fairest object has been taken from second object.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.360
Yes,

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.930
actually buy that icon that I used and it has been substrate acted.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:47.730
Okay,

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.480
so just be careful about these two.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.650
Uh,

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.100
yes,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.220
these two points.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.290
They must,

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:55.920
uh,

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.810
caught each other on the sport.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.960
And it was the second way to balance these part.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.130
Let me make a d sense beating them.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.160
Ah,

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.180
yes.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.050
And set a ruler exactly on these middle port.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.320
Actually,

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.460
between these two objects Well,

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.540
now I should bring these two points down,

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.640
actually,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.560
up to here?

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.450
Actually,

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:22.910
yes.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.460
It's up to here,

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.850
and I use direct selection tool to do that.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.220
I bring them down after my ruler,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:37.140
I choose my move to to set the ruler out off selection,

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.050
but yes,

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:38.800
actually,

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.850
press chief key and drag on my ruler.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.810
If you do,

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:49.060
your ruler won't be selected on now.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.590
You can bring these parts up by shift key.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.300
Well,

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.920
now we need to draw these triangle,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:02.020
and we can use pen tool right over here to do it.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.110
Actually,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.460
we have pento uh,

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.590
Assisi here,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:15.680
Penn plus pen negative that these two are used to add and remove points on our object,

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.640
for example.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.050
Ah,

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.880
I can do something to show it.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.740
If I choose these part,

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.210
I mean this point,

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:28.260
I can remove it by a click and vice a versa.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.480
When I choose to the small,

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.850
it means I can add the points by clicking on the object.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.050
Actually,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.120
I have nothing to do with them.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.830
And I just need pan tool.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:41.710
Andi,

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:49.760
I consider read somewhat on the line you see here and here have decent from order on the

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.410
are in peril.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.040
Yes,

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.370
I step on the sport to create a point.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.580
And as you see,

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:05.390
my smart guide is showing me that I'm creating the point parallel to these point.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:06.550
I said it.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.610
Ah,

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.220
I keep pressing shift key.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:16.550
Then I said another one here and then here.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:25.000
And the last one here.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.760
Uh,

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.370
and as you see,

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.460
when you back to the first point,

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.720
you can see a circle and it shows that Yukos on.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.310
Choose that.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.260
You can close the point now,

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.510
and if it doesn't show you,

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:46.950
it will set another point for you and it won't close your selection.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:51.440
So I closed my chose No,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.950
I could become my object.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.480
We have moved to and I'll choose these point by direct selection.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.720
And I cant clicked on negative pan to army at this point.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:07.040
Or I can step on the spark to use negative pen.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.540
Yes,

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.880
actually,

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.880
I use it to do the same.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.110
There is no difference.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.980
Uh,

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.760
actually,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.980
you can do both ways.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.730
Uh,

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.430
I choose it on.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:30.540
I mean this point a zoo saw by omitting these point thes upper point will be connected to

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.500
these point automatically.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.200
Yes,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.970
ID like to show it before I explain.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.760
Ah,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:47.450
So I choose my pan plus toe at a point here before these connection and before I meet that

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.410
meat that point.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.350
Now,

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.810
I can use my direct selection of these option toe under these peace.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.910
Now,

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.600
these object is completely as same as these objects.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.550
Ah,

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:03.340
you see here and,

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.450
uh actually there a same as each order,

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.350
Uh,

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:13.500
and we can see sympathizing for then export somehow.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.660
And we correlate it there,

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.940
huh?

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.800
Now to design thesis style that you see here,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.050
we should design something like that.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.260
Okay,

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.930
lady said it here.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:28.620
See?

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.710
Other first,

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:30.730
uh,

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.710
should design.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.950
This is style here.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.550
Okay.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.380
As you see,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:43.010
we have a decent here that we don't have it here in the sport.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.870
And we should take care a lot to design all the parts.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:47.770
Exactly.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.140
And with a cure.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:49.640
See?

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.000
So other first,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.860
we should create the shape that you see here with the same style on By paying attention to

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.970
my final words,

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.430
we can create the slugger.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.270
Yes,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.460
I use this object.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.350
Then I'll rotate it.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.840
Uh huh.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.860
I said it here for now.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:18.040
Then I cup eight and or I can press,

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:27.050
shift old command or shift old control in operating windows Another way.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.350
Let me do it.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.410
Let me do it right now the way that I told you.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:39.230
Shift old command or shift old controlling operating windows with a d key.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.710
I mean,

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:45.400
shift control old and d to appear This panel again.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.020
I mean,

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.170
why kick?

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:54.930
And I said X stick to set my symmetry around the x axis,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:00.790
and the preview is on on by click on copy to get a copy of it.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.210
And I said it here,

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.850
let me set a ruler here actually to see it.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:12.390
Exactly what I what I'm gonna do to see exactly what I'm gonna do.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:12.880
Yeah.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.090
See,

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.440
it hasn't been designed with a curious e,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:18.690
I mean,

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:19.850
with more accuracy,

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:20.340
but well,

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.850
designed this one with Maura Accuracy.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:23.710
Actually,

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:28.220
the ruler is on the intersection Point.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.850
Yeah,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.050
uh,

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.220
actually,

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.930
we're gonna make it with more accuracy.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.080
Don't reward at all.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.330
Is prepared it before to show it.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.960
Now we stick to triangle.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.950
Uh,

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:54.050
we stick it to its in front point.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.660
Let me close.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.950
Photoshopped software.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:02.900
I want to close exercise oft wears because the laptops fan,

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.170
I mean,

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.060
the fan off laptop has begun to work.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:06.470
Well,

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:11.660
I said my desire to style Here I step here.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.190
Yes,

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.490
I said my desire to style.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:22.410
Here I step here and I said it to a coup.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.240
Allies.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.550
The descends here?

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.380
Yes.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.760
Now it has been fixed somehow.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.840
Uh huh.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.390
You may hear some sounds or voices.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:45.330
It's just because off my fan on a chrome uses a lot rum and its hardware used age is

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.560
totally high.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.440
It was active by lots of taps.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.630
The potential was active.

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:57.650
And the addition software is active right now to record my voice and,

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:58.260
uh,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:03.750
Camped Azia software is active to record the radio.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.640
All of all,

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.900
of the more active.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.610
And these causes too active the fan with loud noise.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.450
Well,

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.320
you can see that they're different from each order.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.620
So I should say these two points together and,

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.110
uh,

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.040
balance them Yes.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.380
Or these Lower one.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.350
My chance to do it.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.950
Uh,

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:35.960
I can't do it for both off them to get the intended decide is so I used a lower on I a

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.870
second here completely resume on more,

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.980
and I do it with more accuracy.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.550
Well,

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:47.720
I can use a square like as I design here,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.720
and I'll change it into diamond.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.670
Okay.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.450
Actually,

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:57.420
I use Chief to do it I designed a square by shifty,

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.910
and now I choose my move toe.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.730
Then I related 45 degrees about 45 degrees.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.860
Uh,

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.190
and I said it at the middle of,

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.950
uh,

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.130
uh,

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:16.900
these shape and by praising shift and old keys I miniaturized from two sides.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.460
So it has been set.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.470
Now I choose these object on.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.250
I'll bring it down after here.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.590
Where is necessary by shift key.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.730
Well,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:28.760
as you see,

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.610
similarities are getting mawr on.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:33.790
Duh.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.490
They're getting more.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.520
And we just need another object.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.960
I choose my tool.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:48.000
I used the symmetry of these and actually I press shift,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.870
command or control old and the to appear this panel.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.290
We checked it before,

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.290
So do it.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:03.450
If you didn't actually on I click on copy to get a copy of these shape and painted here.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.470
Okay,

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.900
it is balanced from the top side.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:13.550
I mean upside and we balance it from the downside too.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.120
Well,

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.770
you can see that our project is being developed well,

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.690
and see,

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:25.970
we can set these tilt style off line here.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:26.870
I choose move,

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:27.340
tool,

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.800
and then I'll bring it up to here.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.990
I'll bring it up to design it for myself.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.450
This way.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:44.510
I take this point and I said it by its front coins.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.330
Access or let it better later.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.010
Lately,

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.660
There for now.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.290
Well,

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:55.450
I just need to stick them together in a completely I mean completely.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.230
Let me set a ruler here.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.390
Oh,

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.450
we made a D stands below.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.950
I do the same here,

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.790
and I will take them away from shorter.
