00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
Hello,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.880
dear guys,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.990
I am Payments said will come to the fourth part of our education.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.950
I hope you have complete use of the education up to here,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.830
and I hope you to injury the rest of me,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.270
as you know,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.050
recreated a logo.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.830
Then we transform eat 234 After that,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.180
we created a reason cord and hit her shit for it.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.980
And now we're going to create the website off our imaginary company.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.060
Actually,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.400
we should use finish up.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.730
And illustrator software is to do all of these works in this session.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:56.450
We're going to use just the foolish up software to design Lee swept side for our imaginary

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:04.070
company C you would consider to topics When you want to create a website,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.080
you pay attention to these points.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.090
One of them is your creativity and experience.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.080
And the other one is the tool which you have to learn to work it.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
Actually,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.250
sometimes your creativity,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190
your hands on your experience,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.490
you must try it.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.360
Yes,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.100
he was tried by yourself.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.670
And sometimes you can use the others.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.210
Extremists is to I mean,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.210
what's the others?

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.770
Work wishy orders work samples and consider them as your pattern pay attention to the size

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.430
of phones and photos,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.610
A attention to the sitting off photos Pay attention to the color of works.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.840
It's better to learn how to work with the tools to.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.630
Actually,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.290
the creativity is divided in two parts inherent and acquire.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.950
It means you must get the creativity by watching the work samples.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.510
Do not expect much from yourself.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.140
If you're amateur,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.620
actually,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.040
you'll be experienced step by step.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.280
You'll be able to design this website by using the previous tools which were introduced,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.670
and using the tools and methods that I'm gonna present them in these video,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.540
and I know that you can create it easily.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.880
You know,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.890
uh,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.990
it's easy to design it.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.040
It's really easy,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.640
so just pay attention.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.370
Actually,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.390
you'll be able to design my website that you won't.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.980
As you see,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.870
this is an image,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.750
and you can use right click and select save image as option to save it.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.770
Actually,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.860
the finish up software considers and output process for you off course after you finished

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.750
your project.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.150
Ah,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.450
Okay.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.110
Let's run the software.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.050
Open it.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.410
See,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.660
I've designed it before.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.730
Should use control.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.000
All shift on s in Venus operating system or command option shift and s in Mac operating

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.370
system to upend,

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.600
uh,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.790
the save for Rep panel.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.340
Or you can open file menu and choose save or save.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.690
As for where options.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.400
But if you use the new version,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.210
you should go to export section and select safe or read option toe.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.290
Open the panel.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.070
Okay.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.520
As you see,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.980
the shirt cut keys are mentioned here.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.550
You can terminate your work and save your work from here and get to the quarter in order to

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.750
cut it for you.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.130
Uh or you can do it by yourself.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.590
Of course,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.160
if you can see,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
there are two icons here.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.070
There are two icons here.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.500
One of them is Earth icon.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.740
The other one is Previ,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.400
American Silicon Previ.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.700
I can't open it on your browser in order to check it before you give it to the quarters.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.540
Okay,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.040
let's start education.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.920
As you see,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.850
I have some guys here.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.390
I use control Ault and zero or command old and zero.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.850
Uh,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.450
let me use it.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.390
Okay.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.220
See,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.050
uh,

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.090
you must set pick cell for the measure of your rulers.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.440
Actually,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.340
you should consider it as the measure of your rulers.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.100
We have two kinds of websites,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.490
single page and full screen.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.380
The websites of were more smaller than now.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:32.010
You remember that the Magaziner size off their weeks was 1000 and 24 or 800 in CRT monitors

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.010
.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.920
Actually,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.780
uh,

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.970
we had to design them in this small size because of our monitors,

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.620
for example,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.870
we had to sit 900 for the weeds or,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.090
uh,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.330
even 800 O r.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.490
805 for the teeth.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.550
And the margin off website is large in the LCD monitors.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:07.780
We should design our website as a single page or full screen forums.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.930
Actually,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.750
now we can apply these two forms and the website.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.140
Uh,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.120
we'll be resized by paying attention to the monitor,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.350
and you can design it easily,

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.970
and it will be shown in each device with a party fuel.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.550
Our form,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.280
for example.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:36.210
The size is different in cell phone or laptop are even tablet.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.880
The size of website,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.950
I mean will be different and different devices.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.660
I mean,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.070
you can visit the website by paying attention to the size of your device.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.690
Yes,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.030
it has some basis.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.950
It can be 1/2 or 12th I mean,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.800
you can consider two pillars for pillars or even 12 pillars for the website.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.280
So how can we create this guide?

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.090
You can set a ruler on the world from here or from the upper part.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.650
Actually,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.990
you can add a ruler in these way.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.010
Uh,

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.830
the first.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.360
We should create a new project,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:25.220
use control and or command n go to the Web part and select these default size.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.350
You can see the sitting part here.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.170
The beasties 90 20.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:39.130
Heidi's 10 80 resolution is 72 the color money's RG me.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.920
I click on Create key.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.580
See,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.010
the or port system has been activated for me.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.340
If you don't need it,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.150
should use command or control and to inactivated from here.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.200
Actually,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.380
these option leads you to have several projects in one main project.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:58.740
I mean,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.270
you can combine the projects with each order.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.990
Somehow you can dio,

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.040
for example,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.770
we can design the website and up on Duh.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.240
Actually,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.610
sorry.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.610
We can design the website and application in one main project.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:20.980
Just know that whatever you increase the Quinta de all layers and projects in one PSC

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.850
project,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:30.100
the magnitude of the world will be increased to and your system will need much power to run

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.130
your project.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.370
And it receives that from your CPU,

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.470
RAM and graphic art.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.390
It means all the sections of your system will be used to run your project.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.780
Somehow the velocity of system will be decreased.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.040
I mean,

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.850
your sister will work slowly and your system maybe freezed.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:52.480
So now you know about the advantages and disadvantages off the artwork.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.930
So I inactivated and then click on create Well,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:05.400
I select new guide layout option from Rio Menu to open Least panel.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:13.760
We can set the number off columns from here if we set 12 for the number of columns.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.020
I mean,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.820
if he said 12 has the number off color columns.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.470
Sorry,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:24.400
we'll face with no problem and we want to change it in two columns.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.930
We have difficult defaults here.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.220
You have some difficulty on select 12.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.210
I can control the descends between the columns by using these option.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:42.260
I said it as 50 as you see the wreath.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.480
Ah,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:49.050
off the columns will be increase and the descends between the content will be decreased.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.950
I think 30 pick cell is suitable for these parts.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:58.880
You can set the value of the margin of your project from here.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.580
We don't need the top and bottom margenes.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.350
Uh,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.350
I say again,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.870
we don't need the top and bottom margins,

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.440
so we should meet them.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.350
We should set the value off left and right margins as 30 peak cells.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.810
Okay,

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:25.350
set 30 pixels for them or even you can change them to for tea in order to make your the

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.990
sense.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.300
I mean,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.650
in order to make mawr d since from the sides.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.490
OK,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.680
do it in order to make more descends from the size.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:33.960
Yeah,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.530
it's bear now we should click on OK,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.880
we could create some rulers for the project.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.050
As you know,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.910
the height is 10 80.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:50.220
It means the project is full screen and also the quarter should do these.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.360
I mean should do his own job to create a full screen project for us.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.720
The quarter will use his own knowledge and ability to set it as full screen in order to

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.680
show the project with a resolution in any device such as cell phone.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.020
Ah,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.590
don't know tallit,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:17.480
but we should set the menu and the position of objects and layers by paying attention to

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.880
each device,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.170
so be sure to design it.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.030
Well,

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.780
OK,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.190
And please,

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.150
uh,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.000
set the menu.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.070
I repeated again.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:36.500
Said the menu and the position off objects on layers by paying attention to each device.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.550
Okay.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.470
Ah,

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.610
for example,

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.150
uh,

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:50.590
we should set these box at the middle of the screen off cell phone,

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.550
See?

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.380
And actually,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.270
we should mean if I it for the for data resolution,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:02.690
No matter if you can show that climb very in this screen of cell phone,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:10.950
just these middle part is important and we can consider the hamburger menu these part.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.430
Actually,

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.900
you should tell the quarter to do it for you,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.340
sir.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.990
The quarter should set the full screen mode for the website.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.580
Other first,

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:28.860
we should create a rectangle set 90 Turney for the wits.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.090
And 10 80 for the height.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.990
Very good.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.550
Now we call her it.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.550
We're going to consider it as a mask layer.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.550
Okay,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:46.650
so we should transfer the first aim age to the project.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.830
Okay,

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.820
let me color it.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.380
Very,

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.650
uh,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.220
now she transferred a midge reshoot,

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.120
uh,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.710
actually drag it to the project.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.850
You drag it to the project from here.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.960
Let me do that.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.880
Well,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.640
very good.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.390
Ah,

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:27.810
we should magnify it by using Ault and Chief cheese.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.110
Good getting on the Entergy.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.290
Very good.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.080
I don't need the guidelines for now.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.620
Let me on the first city.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.630
Tear.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.250
Very good.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.600
Like a teacher.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.650
Uh,

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.940
already?

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.250
Good.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.000
I don't need the guidelines.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.850
For now,

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.180
uh,

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.300
we can appear or disappear them by control H I don't need them for now,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.540
so ah,

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.410
use control.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.210
Etch to disappear.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.650
Them,

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.330
uh,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:02.710
so,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:07.660
Eireann,

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:17.270
both of my projects to continue the education better there beside each other.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:24.480
I should mean if I the main project and I will meet the guidelines.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.040
Yes,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.680
well,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:42.250
you can magnify these phone and the consider that as our main model,

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:48.810
consider left project as our main project.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:49.090
I mean,

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.550
main model the first.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.860
We should design a menu.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.870
It should be designed based on your need.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.220
Or it can be desirable too.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.850
Let me inactivate from center option.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:05.700
Actually,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.180
this option leads you to increase the size off object from both sides.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.830
You can create the menu in anyway.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.260
Uh,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.480
that you lie.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.090
Actually,

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:26.840
50 peaks cells is a good number for the size of height.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.950
I can set it from here.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.910
There,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.810
are you Stick it.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.650
Here,

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.700
let me set it.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.250
Okay.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.500
There.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.400
You stick it here on the upper port.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:50.190
Now we should really use capacity of it to show behind it.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:50.850
Okay?

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.920
Actually,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.210
it depends on you,

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.450
and it's desirable.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:01.450
Now we should transfer the logo to the project.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.970
Okay?

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:13.030
Iest upon these parts,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.740
and then I'll select all the necessary layers.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.460
Weed control cheap.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:31.180
Now I can transfer them to the sport.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.690
Very good.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.170
Very good.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.580
Okay,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.590
I transfer it.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.350
I said it here.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.300
I converted to a smart object to marriage.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.670
The layers,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.400
British order,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.990
actually will assess.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.110
We'll have assess to each layer.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.020
If we don't click on each of them in the sport,

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:58.380
I can.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.870
Unified by control.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:06.710
T we can't even mean if I margin off the logo by a double click on the Slayer,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.750
let me show it.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.100
See,

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:15.450
you should click on Don't resolve option.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.700
We should use Seiki Tomb Unified and Margin of loca.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.150
Well,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.450
I could account in turkey.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:28.160
Okay.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:35.680
Okay.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.860
Uh I mean,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.710
if I'd,

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.000
um,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.370
unified.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.840
A logo will likely con in Turkey.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:49.300
Then I should use control or command w to save it see now I need my guidelines to sit it

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.690
exactly on any part that I want.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.060
See,

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.570
we have this same thing in the main project.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.140
Very good.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.190
Let me zoom in to see it.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.250
Better see,

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:10.310
we should set the logo in the project by paying attention to the guidelines.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.760
Okay,

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.950
let me set it.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.590
Well.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.760
Very good.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:26.910
Yes.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.570
I don't need to guidelines for now.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.550
As you see,

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.840
uh,

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.590
ree transferred the logo from music card project.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.050
And the color mode of it is C N y que.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:52.450
And this mother causes lack of quality in the color of logo.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.470
We can use some of the adjustments to increase the quality off color in the logo.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:04.440
We can use hue saturation adjustment to increase the consistency off color.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:11.110
Or we can use vibrance adjustment to change the color all logo.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.660
Sorry,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.540
uh,

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:19.380
and use the brightest contrast adjustment to increase the quality off color to or even we

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.050
can use exposure and chair adjustments to do it.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:29.760
I select the vibrance adjustment to increase the saturation a little.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.370
See?

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.670
Let me increase it completely.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.260
It's changing both logo and the wallpaper.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.230
See?

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.850
Ah,

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:47.910
we should click on these option if we just want to change the color off longer.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.230
Uh,

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.790
lease option is sleeping mask you can use.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.220
Uh,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:54.550
actually,

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.760
you can see the arrow here.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:03.000
Now I can increase the saturation to show off the blue collar.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.130
I can do the same work.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.660
Mean vibrance handle,

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.130
too.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.030
I select brightness.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.580
Contrast Adjustment.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.830
Andi,

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:16.000
I should click on clipping mask option to change the color of logo.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.370
I can dark it.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.350
Uh uh.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.620
By increasing these handle,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:27.100
I can decrease if the offset handle.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.030
Uh,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.760
okay.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.100
I should set Gummo handle as 80 hundreds.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.380
Very good.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.580
Uh,

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:46.950
Andi inactivated eyes off layers to see how it is.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.830
Actually,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.360
the quality of look has been increased.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.910
Even you can use brightness,

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.170
contrast adjustment to change the color of it.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:05.070
I select clipping mask from here and see ski,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.660
too.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.340
Yes,

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.150
it's very good.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:16.900
I meet it.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.090
Andi used curves adjustment.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:26.130
She's selected clipping mask to concentrate on the logo.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.050
We can dark it or make it light from here,

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:39.540
I can make the light parts more lighter than they were aan den.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.630
I can make the dark parts more darker than they were,

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.480
but don't make them too dark.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.540
or too Lights,

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.070
Kate.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:55.450
Very where in it,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.660
We have a surpassed nice color.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.660
We reached a nice color.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:09.540
You can allocate these adjustment for the logo and select both of them.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.660
Then use control G to make a group.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.150
Well,

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.720
we have some icons here.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.570
We can search them in grill to use them in our project,

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.350
for example,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.550
Uh,

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:29.850
right Instagram icon or instagram logo in Google to have it.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:38.550
You can do this work where you can search your desirable icon in phoned a sound dot com.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.450
It's a nice website.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.350
I like it.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.270
For example,

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.110
huh?

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.520
I can search in a Seagram.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.850
Uh,

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.880
see,

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:57.230
it brings up the longer or instagram for me.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.740
Actually,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:04.160
the quarter can copy the code of logo from here in order to use it in project.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.310
Actually,

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.940
these icon has found mode,

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.820
and because of that,

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.470
the quality of ICANN won't be decreased.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.240
If you change the size of a scream,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.430
I say again,

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.960
the quality won't be decreased.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.870
If you change,

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.380
the sign is off screen.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:29.460
And it's because off the front mode of Aiken and actually the icon will be magnified or,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:29.560
um,

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.070
unified,

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:36.070
based on the screen and you'll face with no problem because it doesn't have pixel mud.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.950
Okay.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.350
Ah,

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.460
so I don't let it from here,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:51.270
and I save it in desirable folder in my desirable folder I've downloaded.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.250
Then before I've done looted the Lugar's before,

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.500
and now I can use them.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.000
I've donated all of them from these websites,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.100
so Ah,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.540
I can transfer them to the project.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.040
I should use,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:08.760
uh,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.700
these icons in my project in order to complete it.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.570
I should use in turkey.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.050
Let me sit down here.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.930
Okay?

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.660
Use it.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.490
Usually for several times.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:38.430
I select all of the icons with shifty and then I'll men if i them with control T Very good

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.430
.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.450
I sent them on these parts.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.200
Okay,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.470
thesis size is suitable.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.330
No,

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:55.050
we can set them one by von on the menu.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.390
Other first.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.080
We can sit instagram I come on the menu.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.560
We should move up the layer off Instagram Aiken.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.950
Okay.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.360
Ah.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:14.560
Then I should set the other Aiken closed today.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.290
Any Seagram icon And I'll tell you why,

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:21.710
but it okay,

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.680
let me set the Facebook.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:32.090
I can hear the next one.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.470
Ease to eternal logo.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:41.980
I used shift key to movie irregularly and I sit on.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:48.940
I said it close to the Facebook logo the next morning is the legal off.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.310
What?

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.850
Samp?

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.720
I do the same work for this one,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.360
too.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.310
Actually,

00:25:55.310 --> 00:26:01.020
the beak off bird should be aligned with lower section off.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.670
What's up logo?

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:08.240
I do the same work for the local of YouTube,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.940
then Google Plus.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.260
And finally,

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.550
I'll set linked in Logar in these part.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:21.170
Very good.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:26.160
So let me set it.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.660
Actually,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:37.160
this size of it is standard at me.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:42.350
Let's let me mean if I it a little use control t to do that,

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.950
use control t to unify it.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:45.440
I mean,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.340
uh,

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.660
now we should use control or command key.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:27:00.190
We'd shift key and then click on all of them to select them in order to make descends

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.850
between them.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.660
Okay.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.010
Now,

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:10.310
if you use arrow cheese and chief key to make distance between them,

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.100
I can click on each one and then use shift key,

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.100
an arrow key to make the distance.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.960
Luis work for all of them.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:34.490
The locals has been set regularly beside each other,

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.180
and now we can move them here.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:43.280
I need my guidelines to work regularly.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:52.710
I said them between these two columns.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.860
Very this.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.210
Between these two columns,

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.190
we have two icons here.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.580
Ah,

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:08.070
and we should set them on the left side.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:12.070
One of the reasons he may like on the other one is telephone.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.350
I can,

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.540
if you want to put them in a circle.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.440
You should.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:18.810
I mean,

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.010
if you want to insert them in a circle,

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:25.030
you should mean if I them and if not,

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.210
don't unify them.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.180
I said it here.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.710
I said they saw on.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:43.770
And here I said it in this column resuming.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:44.370
Okay,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:50.080
we can unify them to put them in that circle.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:58.010
Should mean if I you should modify them to put actually Sorry,

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:01.720
We should unify them to insert them in the circle.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:08.840
I should select l'eggs tool to dry circle.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.290
We shift key.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:18.060
Ah,

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.880
well,

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.300
I can use this.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.230
Could to cholera it.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.800
It's 85 85 85.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.760
You should use control or command with left bracket to send it to lower layer.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.310
You should select both off the layers.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:41.330
How other first to pressing on control or command key.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.390
Then click on the blank space.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.130
Well,

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:51.160
now select the circle and use shift key to select the logo.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:57.620
Now you should allying name but each other so aligned them very shooter by these two

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.260
options.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:58.990
Well,

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.410
they were aligned,

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:05.680
but I think I should move the logo to left side.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.680
Of course,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.760
one pixel is enough.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.310
I feel I should unify the logo a little or Ah,

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:16.570
I feel I should magnify the circle.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:18.160
A little looks,

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.070
no matter.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.980
Uh,

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:27.640
I take a co pay off circle by old key I selected by Control Key.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.570
And then I'll copied here.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:38.130
Now we should do the same word with the song to Okay,

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.660
I stick it here.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.760
I stick it to the ruler.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.450
Very good.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.970
Now I should unify them.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.680
I select them.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.050
Then I should use shift key to identify them.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.660
Very good.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:31:02.800
Now I should use white culture to color them.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:08.810
Let me sit them here.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:09.360
Very good.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.200
Okay.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.660
Use a white color to color them.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.870
Change them toe white.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.040
If you select these,

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:19.550
uh,

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:26.120
layers and used control G to make a group for them,

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:34.350
see double click on the group to open a layer style panel.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:38.860
Now check car or lay and click on it.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:46.490
Then set white color for the Aiken's very good.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:50.190
Okay.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:52.510
I feel I should mean if I these icons,

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:57.040
I think that yes,

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.700
I feel that I should unify these two icons.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:13.490
Then I should align them.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.950
Okay,

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:20.990
They will be aligned automatically because actually,

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:27.660
they have snapping mud on its just because off the software software has these feature.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.960
Now,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.760
we should design the phone numbers in 14 PT.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.530
I mean,

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.660
the size should be 14 pt.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:42.050
Okay,

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.340
Now,

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.580
I can't write anything that I want detects.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.210
The text should be left aligned.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.330
So do it.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:56.050
Okay.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:33:04.070
Now we should open character panel from window menu.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:19.200
We should sit it as out.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:33.880
Or Onda said these option as 100% or even I considered as 200.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:44.560
We should step on these part and said the phone as a regular army,

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.450
Then I'll take a copy of it.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.860
Uh,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:34:01.950
I'll take a copy of it by old key to sit it for my email to Then I'll adid it.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:02.950
Yes,

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.100
I'll eat it.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:10.860
I can write in Fort scientists,

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:16.610
not come there that you could create the upper part of our website Upton to hear.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:20.670
I feel these Iker czar to beak so,

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:21.550
uh,

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.950
I should select their layers,

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:26.600
then magnify them by control.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.350
T Uh,

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:32.960
a small elements will make your website more beautiful.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:38.550
I move them here to compare them with these Aiken's.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.370
Okay,

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:44.710
Let me move.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.780
Okay,

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.550
let me check them out.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.160
Very good,

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.110
dear Aligned.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:57.800
Okay?

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.860
Yes,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.160
dear.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:01.660
Lined,

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.850
I stick them to the stroller.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:07.010
This guideline,

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:12.030
I mean there.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.390
Now,

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.170
uh,

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:19.080
we should create a sub menu for these parts.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.850
I have home menu here.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.820
Ah,

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:32.580
Onda.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.470
Actually,

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:38.190
I created some sub mean years for it.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:46.700
We should a step on these part to take a CO pay off text and moving down in that size,

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.080
I mean,

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.590
in the same size.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.530
Okay.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.600
Don't change the size.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.450
Very good.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.350
So don't change the size of it.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:07.220
Then we should write home instead of it.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.660
Let me increase the size of phones.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:16.470
I think 16 is suitable now selected.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:27.560
Then keep pressing on old and shift keys and then use right arrow key to take a copy of it

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:27.560
.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:33.830
And now leave old key and use shift key to move,

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.040
eat right,

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.300
But not much.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:37.950
Okay?

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:42.270
I want to step two steps up to here.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.940
Okay.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.370
Movie 12 steps to the right.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.080
Gave or see?

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:52.450
Actually,

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.580
you can stick it to the columns.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.780
Uh,

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.650
okay.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:00.330
Now you should take another copy of it.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:08.380
Keep pressing on old key and then use shift key and drag to the right and do the same work

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.000
again.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.640
Very good.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:16.840
Now I should create the submarine use Use shaped tool in order to dry or a candle.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:24.240
Drag it up to here.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.240
Very good.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.450
Double click on these layer and said black color for it.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:31.950
I mean,

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:32.660
black it.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:38.260
Take a copia of home and movie here.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:43.850
Then sitting at the central direct tangle,

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:53.540
the text should be center aligned because home is the central rectangle.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.550
Now I should align it.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.230
Very good.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:05.170
We should take a copy off home and rectangle,

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:11.300
and then we should move them to lower layer and do the same work again.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:18.200
You can write anything that you want in a set off the board home,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.390
but you should do it before copying.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:26.440
We can decrease the opacity of these two rectangles.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:32.330
I think 50 is a suitable number,

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:36.340
and,

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:36.840
uh,

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.330
we can decrease the middle long to 70.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:47.670
Very good.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.830
Actually,

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.740
uh,

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:54.580
the middle one is darker than the others.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.240
Even we can be crazy to 60.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.520
Well,

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:03.330
we could create the menu website up to now.

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:04.450
Now,

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:07.070
we should create these objects at the first.

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:11.160
We should design a box and write our text in it.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.640
That name Unify the main project.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.660
Okay,

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:21.130
use shaped tool and draw a rectangle in these way.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.230
See?

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:27.940
Okay.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:35.530
Very good.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:39.330
Okay.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:48.030
We can decrease the opacity to 50 and we can take a copy of it to design the purple

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.050
rectangle.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.860
I mean,

00:39:52.860 --> 00:40:03.340
these take a copy of it by control J and magnified by control.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.160
T you can do these work or draw another shape depends on you.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.930
I click on in Turkey and we should increase the capacity to 100.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.430
And then we should change the color of it.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:21.090
Let me see the color of the late Mr Cutter could of that one.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:25.070
It's 40 to 63 f zero,

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:25.690
I think,

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.110
but let me check it.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:27.750
Yes,

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:32.900
it's 40 to 63 if zero Ah,

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:38.730
I take a copy of it and then I'll pass it here but me.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:39.970
Come here.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:40.610
Okay.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:41.990
I pay.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.930
Sit here.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:43.710
Very good.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.120
Well,

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.960
we were successful up to now,

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.250
um,

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.850
way had no problem.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.230
You can make it more narrow by control.

00:40:56.230 --> 00:41:03.060
T now we should select paste,

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.080
learn ipsum from type menu.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.490
But other offers you should activate it.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:10.210
How?

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:10.780
You should,

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.730
uh,

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:19.140
create a text box and then select paced learning.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.060
Some others create a text box.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.150
Okay,

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.280
then paced.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.430
Learn ipsum from here.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:39.230
Remember that the size of it should be 16 because we used these size for all the texts.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.370
It's long text.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:43.260
I caught it.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.620
It's a long text,

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.730
so I should credit.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.520
Well,

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:54.920
we should use control or and we should use control End inter keys to close The text text

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.770
should be left aligned.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:07.220
So do it do from here and now I feel I should change the front of it to make it more clear

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:07.220
.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:12.270
Lift Align it from here.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:17.690
I feel I should change the front of it.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.480
To make it more clear,

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.840
I select these phones.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.310
Let me select a mole.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.410
Okay.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:36.110
Should select all of them.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:42.420
Uh,

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.950
and I should change the phone.

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:51.270
It's like this one is clear.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.740
Yes,

00:42:51.740 --> 00:43:02.880
it's clear now I can decrease the size of phone to 13 if you change the upper texts?

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.650
A little because we changed the phones.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:07.420
OK,

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:13.070
very good.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:27.110
We should open the paragraph panel by clicking on these Option.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.210

Option to select justify mud for the text.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:49.560
If we selected the text will be aligned from both sides.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.220
Well,

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.230
um,

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:57.690
we finished our work with these panel.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.480
Now we should take a co pay off,

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.690
learn ipsum to create text.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.220
Good.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:09.280
We can increase the size of it to 70.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.400
Increases size to 70.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.280
Varied.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:18.100
Now we must modified this tense between the letters.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.040
I open this panel and I said it as zero.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.350
Uh,

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:31.500
we can do the same world with the paragraph and the upper part to actually is desirable.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.280
I said he stands between the letters.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.060
Uh,

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.100
we should put learn ipsum here.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:43.870
The guidelines show that I'm doing well.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.700
I take another copia of learned Epsom,

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:51.100
and then I'll decrease the size of it to 30.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.550
Actually.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.730
Do 35.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.110
Let me sit it out the first.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.800
Very good.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.820
Actually,

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.530
the guideline shows that I'm doing well.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.430
As I said,

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.520
we should take another copy of Learn Epsom.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.230
And then,

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:08.180
uh,

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:12.040
we should decrease the size of it to 35.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.030
Now,

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:16.320
we should use purple color to color.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:22.800
The title and subtitle should select both of them.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.570
You must activate our text tool.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.800
And we should take a copy of these color.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.950
Actually,

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:31.440
it's two door.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.380
She'd make it lighter.

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.620
The color could,

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.700
uh,

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.710
he's 19 9 a f four.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:44.720
Okay,

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.090
we can use that website,

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.410
uh,

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:52.340
to create this hour,

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.600
which is going to guide the user.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:46:01.590
You should search arrow in these part.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.520
You can select.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.860
Each warned that you,

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.640

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.370
See,

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:13.140
you can select each one that you like.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.510
Ah,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.460
I select on Gueye.

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.540
Select.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.530
Let me change.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:23.990
Is it?

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:28.040
I select and save the swarm?

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.570
Uh,

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:36.990
I select and say this one in Aiken folder.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:38.220
Okay.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.290
Now I should add it.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:46.380
Unified and click on in turkey,

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:53.150
then sited on the sport.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:58.620
Now we should change the color of it.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:03.500
Double click on its layer.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:03.780
I mean,

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:12.090
double click on the layer of it and set the same color for each from color or early part.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.860
Actually,

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.200
the arrows are different from each other.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.680
It's better to use this one because the cooker well,

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:30.200
we'll be ableto work on this project better.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.200
And I changed at on by myself.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.470
I mean,

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:39.420
I changed that on which is in the main project,

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.290
but myself.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:44.450
Very good.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:47.990
Now we should change the color off photo.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:56.630
We should use some of the adjustments to do it.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:57.550
Actually,

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.900
adjustments are so useful,

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.480
we should,

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.240
uh,

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.110
back to the main project and chickened out.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.350
I stepped on the main project,

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:13.290
Casey.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.610
We used,

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:17.280
uh,

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:23.580
a gradient adjustment and to exposure adjustment.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.780
Well,

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:30.990
uh,

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:38.400
we should use these two adjustments and set them in the way that we like.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.020
I mean,

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:43.520
should control the setting by ourselves is desirable.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.450
I'll show the colors to you and,

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.890
uh,

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.250
you can use them.

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:53.370
Of course I shall should color codes to you,

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:54.720
and you can use them off course.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.020
If you want to create something like these,

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:03.190
I open gradient editor panel and set these color for gradient.

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.170
The color could days.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.190
I mean the color code of these pallets.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:19.460
00 33 in 19 9 The color code of the swan ease 55 27 BD on the collar coat of this one is

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.260
zero capacity off.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.330
This palette is 100 the next one is zero.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:25.350
Uh,

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:27.180
we can drag them here,

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:32.150
or we can click on a photo layer and select Gradin adjustment from here,

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:33.580
and then we can set it.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.060
As I said,

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.260
we can drag it here,

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.220
so I did it.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:41.720
Now I should double click on the gradient layer to set it,

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:49.490
uh,

00:49:49.490 --> 00:50:03.050
double click on and said it up to drag it up to here and increase the scale should increase

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.770
the scale.

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.570
Very good.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:19.440
Do it from here so we can add the gradient from here and then Or can the settings it's told

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.810
holly desirable?

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:24.270
You should do it by yourself by paying attention to your own desire.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:28.380
You should set the numbers that I showed you off course.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:32.500
If you want to create something like these something similar to my own project,

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:39.330
you can use the upper pallets to change the opacity of work or reuse unused lower pallets

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:40.670
to work on the color.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:44.910
You can add a color by clicking and set any color that you like,

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.390
and you can meet it by dragging down.

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.770
See like these.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.450
The next adjustment is exposure.

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.570
Exposure and offset,

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:54.940
uh,

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.180
are both zero,

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.020
but the the Gunma,

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.690
He's 30 33 hundreds.

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:06.700
It's 33/100.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:11.210
We go to our own project to select exposure adjustment from here.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:12.730
Okay,

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:14.700
we set the same numbers.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.510
Very good.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:17.710
Re Gorder.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:21.270
In order to set the same numbers and use them,

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:24.320
it's too dark now.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.150
The other one is exposure to see the exposure Ease.

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.810
Uh,

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:30.320
positive too.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.900
Offset is zero on gum.

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.260
Unease want,

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:39.710
See?

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:44.400
So I said the same numbers in these part two.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:51.460
We should work on the capacities to make something like the main project.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:54.070
I said it as a T.

00:51:54.070 --> 00:52:07.540
Yes,

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.460
OK,

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:12.140
I said 80 for that one,

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.600
too.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:17.160
Now I said 50 for least one.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:17.770
Okay,

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:18.840
it's better.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.770
Very good.

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:28.410
We could design the upper part of our website up to now successfully,

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:36.760
we'll continue to work more faster than the sport because revert on most of the details.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:42.030
Three parts off these education are remained.

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.600
What?

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.160
