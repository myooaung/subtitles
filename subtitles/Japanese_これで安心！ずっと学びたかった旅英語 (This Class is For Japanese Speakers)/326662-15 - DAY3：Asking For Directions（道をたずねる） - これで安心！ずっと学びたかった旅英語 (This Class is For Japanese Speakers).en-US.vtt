take green.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.240
Nobody.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.960
Hanover can go bite us like you know.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.890

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.450

I'm sorry to bother you,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.550
but I would like to go to the lookout.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.250
Could you show me the way?

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.500

Okay.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.000
How long would it take if I walked?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.820
About 15 minutes.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.070
Go down west Georgia street toward Canada.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.850
Place and turn right at West Hasting Street.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.250
Walk for blocks and you'll see the lookout on your left.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.040
Great.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.750
