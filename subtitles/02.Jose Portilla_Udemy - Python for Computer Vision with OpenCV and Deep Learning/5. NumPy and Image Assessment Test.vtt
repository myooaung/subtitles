00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.690
Welcome back everyone you now know enough about pi and images in order to have an assessment.

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.340
This is just going to be a brief overview essentially just making sure that you understand a few of

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.640
the key concepts that it went over in the past few lectures.

4
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.500
Let's go ahead and open up the notebook.

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.630
It's called the NUM PI and image assessment.

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.440
And right after this we also will go over the solutions the assessment and the solution notebook.

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.500
It's up to you whatever approach you want to take.

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.240
You can either just take the assessment on your own and then check against the solutions lecture or

9
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.460
just treat the solutions lecture as a code along project.

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.520
OK I'm going to go over the assessment now.

11
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.840
All right.

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.510
So you can find the assessment underneath the non-pilot image basics folder.

13
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.460
It's called 0 3.

14
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.470
That's not pie image assessment and it's a notebook file.

15
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.950
So your task is to just complete these tasks in bold below.

16
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.720
And that's essentially assessment.

17
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.790
So you're going to need to import some pie and then you want to create a five by five array where every

18
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.870
number is a 10.

19
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.930
So you can see the expected result should look something like this.

20
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.920
Now remember we showed you how to create arrays of zeros energies of ones.

21
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.080
So if you have an arrays of 1 then you may be able to multiply it by a particular number in order to

22
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.250
achieve something like this.

23
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.640
So that's just a little hint for that.

24
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.930
The next task is to run the Sobol below here to create an array of random numbers and see if you can

25
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.100
figure out how it works.

26
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.480
So again just a quick review we actually showed this in the lecture but just to review if you can't

27
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.890
check the documentation here to understand what this line is actually doing and how it's actually working.

28
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.280
Then we want you to figure out what are the largest and smallest values in the array.

29
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.040
Then we want you to use PCL or Python imaging Library in that plot lib to read and display the puppy

30
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.510
image.

31
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.540
So we actually did that in the lecture which is a very quick review of a lot of the stuff we did in

32
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.640
the lecture and then finally we want to convert the image to an umpire array.

33
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.040
Again we showed that in the lectures so just to check if you remember how to do that.

34
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.820
And then the final task is to use slicing to set the red and green channels or the picture to 0 and

35
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.780
then use show from the public library in order to show the isolated blue channel.

36
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.090
So in the previous lecture we showed how to isolate the red channel.

37
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.730
Now we want you to isolate the blue channel.

38
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.610
It's going to be a very similar process.

39
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.020
So there should be a very straightforward assessment since it's basically just a repeat of a lot of

40
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.950
the commands we showed in the previous two lectures for future assessments are going to be a little

41
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.140
more creative and not be directly drawn from the lectures much but since this is essentially just a

42
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.980
warm up section of the course we want to take it easy for now.

43
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.460
So just a few questions you can always use the lecture note books for reference.

44
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.070
OK.

45
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.280
Coming up next we're going quickly over the solutions to this assessment.

46
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.970
We'll see you there.
