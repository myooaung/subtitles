Welcome back everyone to this section on image processing.

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.590
So we've already learned how to open and work with images just the basics on open C.v.

3
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.830
Now we're going to do is expand this to just general image processing the section goals are to learn

4
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.890
the various imaging process operations available to us an open CV that will actually perform some image

5
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.800
operations such as smoothing blurring and morphological operations.

6
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.440
Then we also want to understand how to grab properties of an image such as the color space of an image

7
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.040
and also grab information such as the color histograms.

8
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.120
Let's get started.

9
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.220
I'll see at the next lecture.
