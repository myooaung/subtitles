Welcome everyone to this section of the course we're going to take and combine all our skills that we

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.390
learn throughout the course and create a capstone project.

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.350
So for this project we're going to be creating a program that can detect a hand segment just the hand

4
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.240
away from the background and then count the number of fingers being held up.

5
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.020
Let's take a peek at what the finished project will look like.

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.510
All right.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.130
The way we're going to work with this is inside of a red bounding box we'll be able to test the hand

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.350
as it comes in using thresholding and segmenting.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.100
And then we'll count how many fingers are being held up.

10
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.150
He can see me changing the number of fingers.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.940
And there's the little red counter on the edge of that window.

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.830
OK.

13
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.660
So we're going to do is break this out into multiple steps and get started.

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.710
I'll see you at the next lecture.
