00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,430
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,200
We're going to give a general overview of machine learning and the machine learning process.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,330
So before we dive into deep learning and yolo and neural networks it should be the case that we have

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,910
a fundamental understanding of some intuition behind the machine learning process specifically the kind

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,510
of machine learning that we're going to be conducting which is supervised learning now because different

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,130
students have different backgrounds in math.

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,030
We're going to get the mathematics behind these different methods pretty light.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,110
But if you're really interested in the mathematics behind machine learning and the algorithms we're

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,220
going to be using you can check out the resource links as we go along.

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,910
And a really great textbook on just general machine learning is an introduction to learning by Gareth

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,050
James and I would really recommend that if you're interested in machine learning you take a look at

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,980
this book.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,760
It's actually not really related to image analysis or deep warning on images.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,890
It's just the general textbook about the math behind machine learning and general machine learning concepts.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,570
It's a great book.

16
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,330
It's freely available online.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,510
Again live coverage of algorithms that really aren't introduced in this course but I still really love

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,660
this book and recommend that to all my students.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,440
OK that's enough for that plug of the book.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,890
Let's go ahead and continue.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,670
So what is machine learning machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,930
model building using algorithms that we learn from data.

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,240
Machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed to look

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,860
pretty much all our image analysis with open C-v and Python.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,400
We've been telling the computer what to actually do with the image we've been telling it to perform

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,310
morphological operators or perform certain filters or thresholding machine learning is kind of going

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,250
to flip that on its head where instead of going to give the computer the images and the desired output

28
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,470
such as classifying something as a dog or cat and the deep learning algorithms are going to be able

29
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,560
to work out on their own.

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,550
The best approach to take and I know that's kind of a very high level overview but really that's the

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,470
idea here that we're kind of flipping it around.

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,480
We're giving the desired output and the input and the computer's going to figure out what it needs to

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,500
do instead of the reverse which is what we have been doing given the input telling the computer a list

34
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,130
of instructions of what to do and then getting our desired output.

35
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,320
So what does machine learning used for.

36
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,830
It's used in a bunch of stuff things like fraud detection such as getting a call from your credit card

37
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,540
company saying they have a fraudulent detection on your account.

38
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,430
New pricing models pattern image recognition tech sentiment analysis recommendation engines a whole

39
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,740
plethora of applications and we're really focused on how we can apply machine learning to image analysis.

40
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,120
So the kind of machine learning we're going to be conducting in the section is known as supervised learning

41
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,850
and supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples such as an input where the desired

42
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,320
output is known.

43
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,170
For example we're exploring how we can give the input of a picture that has a category label such as

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,000
a picture of a dog or a picture of a cat or someone has manually labeled that you have an image of a

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,810
dog or an image of a cat.

46
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,420
That way once the machine learning model has been trained we can give it a brand new picture that we

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,000
don't have a label for and it will attempt to predict whether it's looking at a dog or a cat so the

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,350
learning algorithm is going to receive a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,360
and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with the correct outputs to find errors.

50
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,430
It then modifies the model accordingly.

51
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,510
And supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data point can predict a likely

52
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:41,330
future event such as historical image data can then predict what new image data is.

53
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,450
So let's take a look at the machine learning process.

54
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,130
And this is really the core of this particular lecture.

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,100
So this is the machine learning process and we're going to go through it step by step.

56
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,310
Again this is the supervised learning process.

57
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,800
The first step is to actually get your data.

58
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,820
And since we're working with image data you'd have to actually grab the images and these can be sourced

59
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,870
from customers who are uploading images.

60
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,540
Maybe ask every customer to upload an image of what their living room looks like or different furniture

61
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,490
in their living room or maybe have sensors like on a self-driving car you're taking pictures as the

62
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,140
car is driving and getting images of the road for maybe late detection techniques or that sort of thing.

63
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,250
So again we have to figure out how we're actually going to get our data in this particular course.

64
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,600
We provide all the data for you so that job is pretty much already done for you.

65
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,540
So once you actually have the raw data those are the raw images or raw videos then you move on to data

66
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,700
cleaning and formatting and for image data carriers actually has a lot of nice built in tools in order

67
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,730
to clean and format your data correctly.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,180
So it's often the case that you actually have real image data that comes in a bunch of different sizes

69
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,210
maybe different formats or maybe it's skewed differently.

70
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,550
Pictures are rotated and using carrots we have an image data generator object that can stretch and resize

71
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,350
images as necessary plus perform a lot of other applications on them.

72
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,820
So we'll be viewing that closely later on in the section of the course.

73
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,450
So now we've acquired the actual images.

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,760
We've cleaned them up resize them perform different operations on them and then it's time to actually

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,700
take that image data and split it up and we split it up into a test set and a train set or test data

76
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,040
and training data.

77
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,500
So the first we're going to do is just grab the training data.

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,220
And typically a split could be something like take 30 percent of those clean images and set them off

79
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,320
as test data and then take 70 percent of them and set them as training data.

80
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,270
So let's focus on that training data.

81
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,540
What we do is we apply our model on the training data and have it learn simply on the training data

82
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,680
and then we build and fit the model to that training data.

83
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,280
Then we want to evaluate how well our model perform.

84
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:44,200
So we take that we take that test data that we set aside and then we actually test the model on that

85
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,290
test data essentially trying to predict on the test data.

86
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,420
Well we actually already know the correct label.

87
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,480
So then we can evaluate the model and see how it performs.

88
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,620
Then in case we want to adjust parameters in our model we can take it back to the training and building

89
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,290
phase and then fit the model again and then retest and we can redo the cycle over and over again until

90
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,270
we're finally satisfied with the volume evaluation metrics that our model is performing with and we'll

91
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,900
discuss classification metrics in the next lecture.

92
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,120
So once we've done that we can deploy our model essentially predicting on new incoming data that was

93
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:25,200
outside of our original dataset Now image classification and recognition is a very common and widely

94
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,920
applicable use of deep learning machine learning with open city and kurus.

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,180
So we did continue now by learning about how to actually evaluate it classification task and we're going

96
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,260
to review if we go back here really this step right here.

97
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,070
So we're going to review the step of model training and building and then how we actually test and evaluate

98
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,210
our model so that's really the key component that we're going to be viewing throughout the section of

99
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,050
the course.

100
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,460
OK.

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,730
So let's go ahead and continue on to the next lecture where we learn about classification metrics and

102
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,090
how to evaluate a classification algorithm.

103
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,970
We'll see it there.
