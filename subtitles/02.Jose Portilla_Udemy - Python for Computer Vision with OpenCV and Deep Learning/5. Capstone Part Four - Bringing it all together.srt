00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,220
Welcome back to four of your cup project.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,200
Well we're going to bring all the functions together and write a little bit of code to actually run

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,020
the program connect to our camera and then our fingers.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,160
Let's get started.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,050
OK.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,730
In this final cell we're going to begin actually grabbing our video.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,570
So say video capture or of this from a live stream.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,780
So put zero.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,510
And we actually want to calculate that background using that background function.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:42,780
The accumulated running way average so I'm going to initially say number of frames is equal to zero.

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,980
And they We'll have a little counter for the first 30 to 60 frames.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,230
We're going to calculate the background average before we actually put her hand into the image or into

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,260
the region of interest and then we'll create our Waialua pier.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,060
Let's get a little bit more space.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,730
We'll say it while true will start grabbing information so we'll see.

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,780
Read off the camera equals

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,060
and then we'll create a copy of the frame to pass around to our functions.

18
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:20,820
So I'll say frame copy is equal to Freyne copy and then we're going to grab a region of interes off

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,590
the original frame.

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,840
So that is going to be dictated by whatever numbers if you scroll the way back up top you have here

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,110
this is essentially just defining that red rectangle from the first video.

22
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,660
And you can play around those valleys depending on how your camera set up.

23
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,220
So I say our A-Y top two are A-Y bottom

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:54,380
and then we're going to say Khama are ally writes all the way to our ally left and then we're going

25
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,530
to get a greyscale version of this image.

26
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:10,140
So I'll say CB2 CVT color and then pass in the region of interest and then say go from color underscore

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:20,610
B.G. are to and it's BGR because we're reading directly from open C.B and then we're going to apply

28
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,960
a little bit of blur to the grayscale image.

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,680
Just help us average things out better.

30
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,930
So say Gaussian blue or gray.

31
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:37,260
Is a 7 by 7 kernel and then passen zero as that parameter.

32
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:46,580
And then for the number of frames we can go ahead and say for the first 60 frames we're going to calculate

33
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,070
that accumulated average off the greyscale image.

34
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,730
Now we're going to pass in our first accumulated weight.

35
00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:04,970
Remember we first default to 0.5 and then if the number of frames is less than or equal to 59 we're

36
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,140
going to put some text on the actual screen to say hey wait recalculated the background.

37
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:20,620
So say see we to put text here will pass and the whole frame copy and then we'll just say wait's getting

38
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,710
background.

39
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,700
And you can pass and whatever warning message you want you can choose a location of where to start.

40
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,790
Again you may choose different values depending on what you're actually the speed camera looks like

41
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,110
and where you want the font to show up.

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,860
You can choose that you want where it's going to go if Hershey simple x.

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,800
And then again you can choose a color thickness you want.

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,850
So I'm just going to pass on some default values here for red coloring and then some thickness values

45
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,200
will say comma to OK and let me zoom out just a little bit make sure my princes are balanced.

46
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:55,840
Yep.

47
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:01,820
So essentially saying wait getting background for the first 60 frames and after that we're going to

48
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,110
say else.

49
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,990
So is this else lines up with this number of frames so we essentially have this thing kind of the first

50
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,210
60 frames accumulate the average we should be updating the accumulated weight.

51
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,800
And then if the number of friends is less than 59 put this text on the screen.

52
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,470
Otherwise if we're past the first 60 frames now we're ready for someone to enter their hand into the

53
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,570
RVY Square.

54
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:31,010
So it is a hand is equal to and whoops we forgot to actually show the image.

55
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,070
So after we put the text we should be showing this.

56
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,430
So say show and we'll just call this finger count and we'll be showing the frame copy that we're actually

57
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,080
writing text on.

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,510
OK.

59
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:50,500
Now that's that is done we'll say hand is segments pasand the greyscale image so that will grayscale

60
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,410
and then pass into the segment function which actually segment's the hand region.

61
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,710
First we want to check if the handle is actually calculated.

62
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:07,480
So we'll see if hand is not none there we're going to proceed to do some more function calls here.

63
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,830
So if we're actually texting a hand as an external contour then we're going to unpack this.

64
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,560
So say thresholding hand segments is equal to hand.

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,510
So recall that from the segment function if we come back up here the segment function either returns

66
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,410
None or returns thresholds and hand segment.

67
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,820
The reason I use the tuple and packing later on is because I can't really use tuple and packing of this

68
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,340
none.

69
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,140
Which is why when I first call it over here I'm saying hand is equal to segment gray.

70
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,870
So it may be none at first but if it's not none that I know I can unpack it into the threshold that

71
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,980
hand segment parts.

72
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,890
So here I am doing a little bit tuple and packing folded hand segments and then we're going to do here

73
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:07,720
say CB2 dot or we're going to say draw contours person my frame copy and then pasand the hand segments

74
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:19,580
and then we're also going to add along to this are right and our Y top

75
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,800
and then say negative 1.

76
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,460
You can choose whatever color you want but basically this is going to be highlighting your hand in the

77
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,530
real image.

78
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,370
So we'll focus on that and just a little bit that can give us a thickness of five.

79
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:45,810
So it's actually just to clarify draws contours around real hands and the lifestream.

80
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,920
So we're essentially going have two in those one of the threshold at hand and then other with your actual

81
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,960
region of interest in the hand that you see.

82
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,950
So we're drawing contours around that.

83
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,100
Then it's time to actually count the fingers so say fingers is equal to count fingers and we pass the

84
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,400
threshold that image and the hand segment that was calculated from the hand for the segment function

85
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,680
and then we're going to display the count.

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:21,470
So say CB2 put text and we're just going to pass that into the frame copy finger's going to be an integer.

87
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,190
So in order to actually split as text me a precedent as a string.

88
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,690
So it's the number of fingers there.

89
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,030
And this should be updating again.

90
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,550
You can basically put it wherever you want.

91
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:39,730
So it's going to put it at 70 50 and then say CB2 font again.

92
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,520
Really whatever you want as far as the font.

93
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,040
Well this is the same values as before for color as well.

94
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,160
And then font size let's just go ahead and say to here make it a little smaller.

95
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,300
And then let's also show a threshold at Image.

96
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,380
So we're going to create a new window called threshold in and we'll pass and the threshold that image

97
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,130
there.

98
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,140
So we'll see one window which is essentially showing the frame copy it's trying the contours around

99
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,770
your hand that's putting text saying how many fingers are showing up.

100
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,510
But in a separate when the walls will show the threshold that image.

101
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,580
And this really helps if debugging basically allowing you to adjust your background adjust values such

102
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,300
as if you come back up here.

103
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,920
This threshold minimum value that means that you may need to adjust that depending on what you view

104
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,740
in this threshold that image.

105
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,920
So we going to win windows there and then what.

106
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,650
Once that is done over here towards the outside check the indentation carefully we're actually going

107
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:47,550
to draw a rectangle of our region of interest or say frame copy.

108
00:08:47,740 --> 00:09:00,280
And then I left Aro I top the top left corner and then let's grab the bottom right and say are I right.

109
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:07,970
And Arwa bottom Pessin whatever color you want we'll just make it red and then Besler thickness you

110
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:17,510
want let's call it five and then add 1 to the number of frames because remember we're still saying number

111
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,710
phrase equal to zero.

112
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,340
So we have to do some sort of calculation for them or frames.

113
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,800
So we'll do it here.

114
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,510
So after the first 60 frames will no longer be running this little weight getting background message.

115
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:35,120
And then after that we'll say to him Show will say finger counts

116
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,930
on the frame copy.

117
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:48,410
And we have just a couple of things left actually escaping out of this will say CB2 waky one and then

118
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:56,810
ampersand 0 x f f and they'll say if K is equal to 27.

119
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,890
Go ahead and break.

120
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:05,640
And then outside of all this after we break we'll release the camera stream and then also close all

121
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,810
the windows OK.

122
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,710
Let's save that.

123
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,750
Make sure you run all the cells to define all these functions.

124
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,260
And let's check out make sure it's working.

125
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,570
And it looks like it's opening here.

126
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,790
So you should see something like Wait getting background.

127
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,440
So here it is.

128
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,070
And it looks like I have a small typo.

129
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,160
I said thresholding it's a threshold.

130
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,210
Let me go ahead and fix that.

131
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,450
So it looks like that's happening right after I call Hans segment's underneath hand segment.

132
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,070
Max let's come back up here

133
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,690
and then we're going to say thresh hold it.

134
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,840
So go ahead and restart your kernel we'll say restart colonel

135
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,510
and then run all the cells again.

136
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,320
And once the waiting for background has gone away you should be ready to then enter your hand into the

137
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,690
region of interest and then after a little bit you should see the threshold that image come up.

138
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,010
In my particular example I was having some trouble with my window and the light changing.

139
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,990
So it was picking up some other items there.

140
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,640
Those go ahead and zoom in and see if overall the general concept is working over here in the top left

141
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,080
is my actual finger count and I was having a little bit of trouble at the light in the room as well

142
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,190
as the radius for the circle I chose.

143
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,690
I chose kind of a larger rate is so I had to really extend certain fingers to be able to get them to

144
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,030
count.

145
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,500
You may want to adjust that depending on the size of your hand so you can see I'm holding three fingers

146
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,780
up and then for a stretch that pinky out otherwise it detects as three so bringing in the pinky a little

147
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,990
closer has three versus four again.

148
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,010
But the very basics should be working.

149

If you extend just one finger out versus two versus three or four and then you can always just escape

150
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,300
on your keyboard.

151
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,070
Once you're done and ready to continue on with some other code.

152
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,090
All right that's it for the cup project.

153
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,860
Hope you enjoyed it and I hope you can see how you can expand these.

154
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,300
Just general simple ideas.

155
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,770
Once they're combined can create real software they can find real applications for things and I hope

156
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,060
you enjoyed the course.
