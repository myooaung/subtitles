Welcome everyone to this section on video basics this is going to be a bit of a shorter section since

2
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.050
basically the video version of the image basics.

3
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.960
So the goals for this section is to be able to connect the open C.V library to a web cam and be able

4
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.670
to use open C-v to open an existing video file.

5
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.690
Maybe you already have an MP 4 on your computer.

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.870
You've already taken some video and you want to work with it.

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.980
Open TV will show you how to do that as well.

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.970
And then finally we'll show you how you can draw shapes on a video and interact video drawing shapes

9
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.550
on the video.

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.180
It's going to be a really important part of object tracking object detection.

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.800
So we wanted to get through the basics now that we don't need to worry about learning that stuff.

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.870
Once we actually dive into object tracking an object detection as a quick note it's probably pretty

13
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.980
obvious but you're going to need a webcam to follow along with certain parts of this section.

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.900
If you don't have a webcam that's totally fine.

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.860
You can just skip the parts where we open a webcam and just open up the video files.

16
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.860
We provide a video file in the data folder.

17
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.370
You can play around with.

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.860
OK.

19
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.480
Let's go ahead and get started.

20
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.510
I'll see you at the next lecture.
