00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.560
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to discuss histograms.

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.940
Let's first understand what a regular histogram is and then I will explain what image histogram means

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.940
in general a normal histogram is just the visual representation of the distribution of a continuous

4
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.690
feature.

5
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.060
So here's a simple example that has really nothing to do with images but on the x axes we have some

6
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.280
sort of continuous feature.

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.650
In this case it's how tall these trees are in height.

8
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.750
So then we have these bins and on the vertical axis we have frequency.

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.630
So basically the way you actually read this is you know you have three trees that are between the heights

10
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.330
of 60 and 65 as well as three trees that are between the heights of 65 and 70.

11
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.400
And then the third been coming from the left between 70 and 75.

12
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.880
It looks like it marks about eight.

13
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.710
So then you have eight trees that are between 70 and 75 feet.

14
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.480
Now you can also then display this as a general trend by drawing what's known as a kernel density estimation

15
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.970
plot.

16
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.550
So instead of having those bins instead what you can do is just draw a line that basically reflects

17
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.150
the frequency distribution of whatever x axes you're trying to understand.

18
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.780
Now for images what we can do is we can display the frequency of values for colors.

19
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.710
Each of the three red green and blue channels has values between 0 and 255.

20
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.230
We can do then plot these three histograms on top of each other to see how much of each actual color

21
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.270
channel there is in an actual image.

22
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.700
So here's an example histogram.

23
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.780
In fact this is the histogram for that blue Brick's image that we were working with during the smoothing

24
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.850
and blurring.

25
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.080
So what is commonly done is for each particular color you just color in the histogram so we can see

26
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.380
here that we have in general lower values of red and it seems like we have higher values of green and

27
00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.280
blue and it looks like the yellow peak around somewhere maybe a little close to 225.

28
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.670
Now recall that 0 means pure black.

29
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.410
So if you have an image of a lot of black you would expect to see a lot of peaks in the black or peaks

30
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.160
near zero.

31
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.420
I should say let's explore how to create image histograms with an open C-v.

32
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
All right let's begin.

33
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.390
I've already imported CB2 an umpire in that plotless.

34
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.130
What I will do now is import three images and in fact I'm just going to copy and paste the import commands

35
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.240
from the notebook that we don't just waste time doing the same lines of code over and over again.

36
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.550
But basically what we're doing here is I'm going to import an image of a horse an image of a rainbow

37
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.530
that we were seen before and an image of those blue bricks and hope for all of them and converting the

38
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.800
color to be correct from that.

39
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.800
So I'm actually doing two variables.

40
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.250
One is called dark horse here and the other one is called show horse.

41
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.710
This one is called Rainbow and the other one is show rainbow.

42
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.870
This one is called blue bricks.

43
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.530
And the other ones show bricks.

44
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.510
The reason I'm creating two variables for each particular image is because one of them I'm actually

45
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.370
going to perform my calculations on because we're going to be using open C-v to perform calculations

46
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.810
of color histograms.

47
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.620
We should have it in the RGV color order or BGR color order that open Sivy expects.

48
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.450
If you actually want to show the image though so we can relate the histogram to what we're seeing visually.

49
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.880
Then we'll have this show horse image or show rainbow or show bricks and that one is color corrected

50
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.240
for Matt plotless.

51
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.200
Again here we're using the original

52
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:43.810
blue g r channeling for open C-v and then on the show ones these are converted to RGV for show.

53
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.720
So we're going to keep the originals that we can put calculations on it for the color histograms.

54
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.410
So will you be using open C-v actually performed his calculations.

55
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.410
But let's just quickly show you what these images look like.

56
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.010
So we'll do the show horse.

57
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.370
So what's interesting about this horse picture is notice there's a ton of black around this horse.

58
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.370
So I would expect that a lot of the values are actually spiking near zero since that's a representative

59
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.600
color for black.

60
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.780
So we don't see a whole lot of red blue or green when there's black there.

61
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.240
OK so that's a show horse show rainbow.

62
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.710
So here we can see the rainbow.

63
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.970
It looks like there's a pretty good distribution of colors.

64
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.560
Looks like there's a little more red here but that could be balanced out by the green and blue being

65
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.960
shown over here on the bottom right.

66
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.850
So rainbow is kind of interesting.

67
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.570
And then let's see the blue bricks and whoops I showed the wrong one.

68
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.290
We want show Brick's.

69
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.390
So that's the reason we have to show it's actually display the image blue blue Brick's the original

70
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.600
That's what we're going to be working with and show Brick's is essentially just blue or white.

71
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.140
So it expects to see really high values of blue maybe some green probably not so much in the red.

72
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.050
OK so what do we actually do here.

73
00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:01.670
Calculate the histogram values and that function is simply CB2 and we say calque just those that the

74
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.840
H capitalize.

75
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.660
Then as Listy past the image you want to calculate for those the brackets there.

76
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.300
In this case we'll do blue bricks.

77
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.100
Notice something in blue bricks not show bricks showing which is from at plotless.

78
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.610
And then you decide what channels you want.

79
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.990
In our case let's go ahead and do the blue channel.

80
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.050
So as a list I mean the passen 0.

81
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.920
The reason I'm doing 0 is because remember for open C-v the color channel order is blue green red.

82
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.170
So index 0.

83
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.870
The very first one that will be blue.

84
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.380
So now I'm interested in blue so say channels and then pass in blue there.

85
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.960
Then there's an optional mass parameter.

86
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.010
The mass parameter is if you want to apply umask to only part of the image and only calculate the histogram

87
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.220
for that part of the image.

88
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.940
In our case we want the whole image so say none than the other parameter is just size histogram size

89
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.240
that essentially gives you the upper limit so we can say 256 we want one more than the actual 255 limit

90
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.790
and similar thinking we're going to do is say ranges is equal to and will go from zero to 256.

91
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.670
Again the reason we're going from 0 to 256 is it's essentially up to a lot including 256.

92
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.860
So our values are from 0 to 255.

93
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.330
So we want to add one more.

94
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.430
So we don't cut off any values at 255 and let's say this we're actually going to sign this just values

95
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.920
run that and check it out.

96
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.850
Let's figure out his values.

97
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.980
If we check out the shape of this.

98
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.150
It's 256 by 1.

99
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:40.740
So then we're going to say is PBT plot to his values run that and here we can see the histogram values

100
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.320
for the blue color.

101
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:50.100
Notice that it looks like we have a peak at around 1 to 50 for blue and also peek around maybe 225 for

102
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.030
Blue.

103
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.350
Let's now actually try calculating the same coloring but we'll do it now for this horse.

104
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.830
So remember the horse if we actually see the horse there actually isn't that much color in this image

105
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.690
and there's certainly not a lot of blue color.

106
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.160
This brown is probably more red than anything.

107
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.200
So we should expect to see a lot of blue in this image because most of it is just black and brown.

108
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.160
It's very much contributing from red.

109
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.310
So we shouldn't expect to see that much blue.

110
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:23.120
Let's try it out in the copy and paste the same command place down here instead of blue bricks.

111
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.690
Let's put in our art course.

112
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:33.490
Run that and we'll save realty dot plot and we'll plot out those values.

113
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.810
Run that and for that Darkhorse notice what it looks like.

114
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.340
Pretty much completely different.

115
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.020
You now see that most of the values for the blue channel are actually pretty much zero which makes sense

116
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.280
because most of the image was black which is zero.

117
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.430
And the stuff that was colored in such as the horse that was mainly a kind of reddish brown so I wouldn't

118
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.850
expect to see that much blue.

119
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:59.140
There's a little bit of a bump here kind of close to zero but that's basically probably it's only contribution

120
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.210
to the image so I would expect to see most of this be zero.

121
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:10.300
OK so now let's actually show you how you can plot out the three color histograms all at once sort of

122
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:16.750
come down here and let's do this for the blue Brick's image we'll see.

123
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.750
Image is blue bricks.

124
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.270
So we're going to resign it there.

125
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:30.790
And what I'm going to do is say color is equal to and I'll say a string B for blue string G for green

126
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.470
and then string R..

127
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.440
Remember this is the order the open C-v does.

128
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:42.250
It's colored generally in blue green red and then I will say for eye color and enumerates and all I'm

129
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:48.460
going to do here is essentially call that histogram function three times once for each color will say

130
00:08:48.490 --> 00:09:00.620
any numeric color will say here's our Ezekial to CB2 and then we're going to calculate the highest cocket

131
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.660
the highest the image.

132
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.310
Notice I'm passing it in as a list and then the color channel we're going to be passing in is defined

133
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:11.950
by I I because it's a numerate it's just going to be zero on the blue one on the green and the two on

134
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:12.670
the red.

135
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.690
So that works out.

136
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.400
And then there is no mask will say none.

137
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.130
And then we'll use the same values before 2:56 and the range is zero comma 256.

138
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:30.290
So now that we have that we'll go ahead and plot it we will say Piazzi plot just are and then we'll

139
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:35.430
say color is equal to c o l essentially labeling it b g or are.

140
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.680
And to make sure this is going to change just right appear to be c l that we don't get confused with

141
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.840
this particular color.

142
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.910
So I'll say for I call so short for color and then assign it.

143
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.640
It so c all right here that's going to be B C and R.

144
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.020
They will plot that out and then we can set the limit as well.

145
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.000
Just in case.

146
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:04.120
So just saying the limits in case we get a very large histogram that extends beyond 256 So we're going

147
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:14.600
to set those limits and that outside of the for loop hole title this histogram for blue bricks and let's

148
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.380
run this.

149
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.160
OK.

150
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.370
So here we have the his room for blue bricks and is what we have here.

151
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.860
We don't have a lot of contribution from red.

152
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.990
We have a lot more contribution from green and blue.

153
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.230
It makes sense because if we take a look at that actual bricks image effect we can display it right

154
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.990
here by just saying Piazzi show show Brick's.

155
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.390
We mainly have the colors blue.

156
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.330
OK now let's see what happens if we do this exact same thing.

157
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:53.180
But for the darkhorse so going to say now for horse and change this image to be dark horse.

158
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:58.530
So I rerun that cell rerun this and I see the histogram for the horse and pretty much for every color

159
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.860
that actually that I have that much less change.

160
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.470
Excellent.

161
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.390
So it can kind of zoom in here on what's going on between the values of 0 and 50.

162
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.910
So I will change my ex limits to zero on a 50 and I run that again.

163
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.890
And let's actually now change the Y elements as well.

164
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.000
So we'll go down to maybe 500000.

165
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.250
So there's a really large image there's tons of counts here.

166
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.730
I can change that white limit to say appeal t y lib.

167
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.220
In this case we'll go from zero to let's say 500000.

168
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.660
Run that and now we can really see the bumps we have here.

169
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:38.020
So it looks like red starts getting a bump around maybe a little beyond 10 and a little bit of green

170
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.830
a bump but really not that much.

171
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:46.060
As we know the value of 10 and R.G. be between 0 and 255 that's really not that much color.

172
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.570
So a lot of the image is black and because it's such a large image that pixel count really distorts

173
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.270
the system.

174
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.670
So keep that in mind if you have a really really large image and the horse image is quite large.

175
00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.580
You can check it out here.

176
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.350
We can say Darkhorse shape.

177
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.590
It's 18:00 by twenty seven hundred.

178
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.990
So that means it's going to be eighteen hundred twenty seven hundred times three.

179
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.510
So we have you know this many pixels in it around fourteen point five million.

180
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.950
So that much of the image especially that many dark pixels is pure black.

181
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.270
That's going to start your histogram.

182
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.640
So just keep that in mind as you begin exploring color histograms.

183
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.320
OK we'll stop Part One here.

184
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:32.720
Coming up next we're going to discuss histogram equalization and finish off the section of the course.

185
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.670
We'll see if the next lecture.
