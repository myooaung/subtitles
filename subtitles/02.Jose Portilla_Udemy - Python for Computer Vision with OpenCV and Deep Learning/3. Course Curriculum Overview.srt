00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,090
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,130
We're going to briefly go over the course curriculum before we actually begin the course and the technical

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,740
content.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,440
I want to build an understanding of our particular learning path and why we're starting where we actually

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,490
do and how we approach the various topics in this course.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,040
So let's give a brief overview of main topics and the structure of the curriculum of the course.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,730
So my overall goals for this course is free to be able to understand computer vision applications.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,980
And as we learn about more and more topics we're going to start relating them to real world applications.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,260
At first we're not going to understand enough about computer vision and open C-v to actually make the

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,880
jump to some sort of real world application.

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,240
But as we continue to build off of the little bits and pieces that we learn along the way we're going

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,100
to be able to make more and more connections to computer vision applications like being able to build

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,000
out our own license plate blurring software or being able to understand how deep learning image classification

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,660
works.

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,870
But in order to make that leap we're gonna have to learn the building blocks along the way.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,460
My other goals for you after completing this course is to understand how to use open C-v and Python

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,610
to work with images and videos and more importantly be able to apply these skills to your own projects.

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,740
If we were to jump ahead directly to deploying learning computer vision you would be able to do the

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,180
projects we show in this course but then probably wouldn't have the skills to actually apply that to

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,490
your own projects.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,820
So that's what we're going to start with the very basics and build our knowledge and understanding as

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,980
we go along that we once you complete the course you're able to apply everything you've learned to your

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,050
own projects.

24
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,880
So we're going to start off with learning about a library called NUMP pie.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,850
And if you take in some of my other courses you may already be familiar if not pie in this particular

26
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,730
section we're really going to focus on two things about pi.

27
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,920
The first thing is how to work arrays and slicing and indexing arrays and that's the main data type

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
that Num. PI holds.

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,820
And then the second main part is how to actually read images and display images with some PI.

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,980
After that we'll have a section on image basic's with another library called Open C-v for open computer

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,640
vision.

32
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,920
And we'll begin to work with open C.V in order to work with just the very basics of images and how to

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,870
draw images simple commands like that.

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,170
Once you've learned the basics of Pi and open see how to work with images of both those libraries will

35
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,640
start the more complex and advanced functionalities of image processing of open C.v.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,720
So these are where we're going to be learning about Advanced Open C-v operations that are actually useful

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,700
in real world applications.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,540
Then once you've gotten a handle on images we're going to move on to video processing of open C.v.

39
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,470
So we'll kind of go back to basics however instead of dealing with image data we're going to learn how

40
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,310
to work with existing video files.

41
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,560
MP force or die.

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:01,720
AVI files and we'll also learn how to deal with streaming webcam videos all of the open C-v library.

43
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,510
After that we'll move on to object detection.

44
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:09,340
So we'll learn the various different methods of the tech the objects and images and videos.

45
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,390
So we're going to start with a basic template matching that is to say if you're given an image can you

46
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,550
find that image in a larger image and then we're going to work all the way up to things like face detection

47
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,990
so we can actually detect faces in photos and videos.

48
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,880
Once we understand object detection we'll move onto object tracking.

49
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,090
So this directly expands from the knowledge of the previous section to actually then track and detect

50
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,950
objects in videos.

51
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,820
So object detection allows you to detect in a single image object tracking allows you to kind of continue

52
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,710
that detection through various frames and track it in a video.

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,560
Then we move on to kind of the more final sections of the course which is deep burning of computer vision.

54
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,740
And that's where we begin the compain combine the knowledge from all the previous sections with the

55
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,670
latest tools and libraries like Harris intenser flow.

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,200
First they are deep learning applications and they will also be able to download state of the art neural

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,200
networks in order to perform image classification on your own data sets.

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,540
So keep in mind of course is a very gradual buildup in computer vision.

59
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,580
I know a lot of time students want to jump straight to the awesome deep learning applications but it's

60
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,660
really important that you take your time with these topics as they can be pretty advanced.

61
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,420
Now this understanding of fundamental concepts will like to apply these skills to your own projects.

62
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:25,860
OK.

63
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,250
I'm super excited to get started now.

64
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,670
The technical sections.

65
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,780
So we're going to get started and the next lecture is going to help you set up everything you need in

66
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,390
order to open up our course notebooks as well as have our provided environment work for you.

67
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,030
OK.

68
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,070
Let's get started.
