00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.410
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.800
We're going to talk about images and some pie pie by itself can actually directly open a j peg or PFG

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.950
extension file.

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.150
Instead we need to use it in conjunction with what's known as the pillow or P.L. library which stands

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.520
for Python imaging library.

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.630
Let's go ahead and open up a notebook and then take a look at how this all works.

7
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.010
All right.

8
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.210
So to begin we're going to start by importing them pi as MP.

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.650
And then we'll also say import map plot live thought pipe plot as Piazzi map plot lib is a library that's

10
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.030
actually going to allow us to plot out and display images inside of the notebook.

11
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.410
Now in order to display things inside of the notebook we also need to write out percent sign map plot

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.800
live in line then go ahead and run that.

13
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.860
Keep in mind as a quick note the actual latest versions of Jupiter and Jupiter the lab don't require

14
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.890
this map published in line but I'm leaving it here just in case because it doesn't do any harm.

15
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.210
And sometimes there's bugs.

16
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.900
If you don't have that actual line so that allows display plots in line in the actual note book now

17
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.080
it's time to actually try to open up an image with some pie or two that we first need to open it using

18
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.030
the python imaging library.

19
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.980
So say from p i l in all caps.

20
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.260
Import image.

21
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.630
And those eyes capitalize there.

22
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.650
So this is an image function that allows us to open up images and actually then we're going to be able

23
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.400
to transform this image into an array that numpad can understand.

24
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:53.290
So I will say pick is equal to image the open and then you can just provide the file path for any image.

25
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.690
Now if you downloaded the course notes you'll notice that there's a data folder here and there is a

26
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.390
file called 00 that puppy thought JPEG in the data folder of our actual notes.

27
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:13.820
So that's what I'm going to provide the file path there so I will say data 0 0 bash puppy JPEG.

28
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.890
You need to make sure that you actually are providing the right path.

29
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.690
So in my case this data folder is actually in the same location as this notebook.

30
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.000
But if your one location deeper you may need to say thought forward slash So it really all depends on

31
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.830
where this note book is actually located in conjunction to your actual JPEG file that you're trying

32
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.820
to open.

33
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.380
If you are unsure just go ahead and pass and the whole file path which is going to be something like

34
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.700
C users.

35
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.490
Then your username and so on.

36
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.740
So just keep that in mind.

37
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.140
Otherwise you'll get an error.

38
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.100
So I'm going to now collapse this

39
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.020
so loops.

40
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.450
Looks like I got the air right now.

41
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.580
I need to undo that forward slash.

42
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.210
There we go.

43
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.690
So now I'm ready to go and if I just take a look at this pic and do shift enter I get back this pic

44
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.560
of this adorable puppy.

45
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.810
Now let's go ahead and take a look at what type of object this is.

46
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.800
So far to say type pick it's a right now Python imaging library or P.L. J pig image plugin.

47
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.160
It's a jpeg image file.

48
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.460
So right now it's a jpeg which means that I can't actually deal with it.

49
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.360
But all we can do is transform it into an array.

50
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:35.330
So we're going to say pick underscore a r r as Ezekial to p dot as array and then passen that pick.

51
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.600
And now if I take a look at the type of pick array.

52
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:50.090
It's now a PI array and in fact let's take a look at its shape so cheap right now is 13:00 by 1950 pixels

53
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.650
with three color channels.

54
00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:01.430
And if I say peel T Dot in show it's going to allow us to show this array as an image while passen Pickering

55
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.830
run that and then I get to see the actual array laid out.

56
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.440
So here's the image and this Kilty show it's kind of a special function that's specially designed to

57
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.520
show images that are transformed to as arrays.

58
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:23.430
Now notice that we get these grids so I can see here how it's 13:00 pixels length and about 1950 and

59
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.950
with.

60
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.110
And there's three channels here.

61
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.230
The red the green and the blue.

62
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.380
So let's actually access one of these channels by itself so we can see what's going on here.

63
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:41.380
So I to say pick red is equal to pick a r and I'm going to make a copy of it.

64
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.120
So previously in the non-pilot show we showed you how we can make copies.

65
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.130
Now if I actually just display this red image I get back right now the same image as I did before.

66
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.510
Which makes sense because it was just a copy.

67
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.610
However let's try the following.

68
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.560
We're going to try to zero out the contribution from the green and the blue channels.

69
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.440
So we're going to do is if we're to take a look at this array it's three channels right now.

70
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.940
One 3800.

71
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.000
By 1950 array for read one 3300 by 1950 for blue and another one for green.

72
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.700
In our case it's going to be R.G. B or red green blue.

73
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.400
So how do we actually zero out these values.

74
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.350
Well what I'm going to do is say pick red.

75
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.500
Remember the shape of this is 3800 by 1950.

76
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:39.750
Essentially three arrays of 13:00 by 1950 I'm going to say pick red and then I'm going to grab all the

77
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.010
rows and all the columns in the green channel.

78
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.730
So the way this is formatted Is it goes red channel then green channel and then blue channel.

79
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.380
So each of these shapes one stands for red one stands for green and one stands for blue.

80
00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.650
So if I take a look at just this which means everything in that 13:00 everything in 1950.

81
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.980
But just one that actually stands for the green channel because our would be zero so let's go ahead

82
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.270
and display this.

83
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.460
I'll say peel T.

84
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.660
M. show.

85
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.070
And you'll notice something funny happened here.

86
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.340
You'll notice now the coloring seems very strange and that's because if we take a look at these values

87
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:33.060
they're now all between 0 and 255 and Matt live by default will show this using what's known as a very

88
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.300
this color scale.

89
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.310
So when we ran a show on this.

90
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:44.360
So if I say peel T-Dog him show it took those values and applied some sort of color scale and the default

91
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.710
Like I said is this.

92
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.490
If you actually check out the map documentation on their color codes they have perceptually uniform

93
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.790
sequential color mappings.

94
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.430
And this is this one that goes from Purple all the way to yellow and it's actually specially designed

95
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.030
for people who are colorblind.

96
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.150
And these are all actually designed for people that are colorblind.

97
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:09.330
However this actually isn't really an accurate representation of what this particular array represents.

98
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.910
In fact it's probably more accurate if we were to say See map grey and then run this.

99
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.040
This stands for Color Mapping and we choose grey which essentially just says show this in greyscale.

100
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:29.670
So this right now that we're showing right here this is the red channel values.

101
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.600
They're all between 0 and 255.

102
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.150
Remember there's two more of these.

103
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.250
One for green and one for blue.

104
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.160
So check it out.

105
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:49.050
This is the one for green and then let's check out the one for Blue.

106
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.600
You'll notice that they're all a little slightly different.

107
00:07:51.630 --> 00:08:01.030
So for example so if we take a closer look at the red channel number 255 that means a full pure red

108
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:08.420
0 will then mean know read pure black.

109
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.320
So that means we're actually viewing this in grayscale the closer to whites.

110
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.600
That means more red for this particular image.

111
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.900
So if we take a look at the ears here they tend to be pretty white which means there's high values of

112
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.700
red there.

113
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.630
And if you were to scroll back and take a look at the actual dog's ears you notice that his ears actually

114
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.940
do contain quite a bit of red.

115
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.500
It's kind of an orange color.

116
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:38.540
But if we take a look at the other colors such as the color mapping for green or color mapping for Blue.

117
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.130
You'll notice his ears appear now quite dark.

118
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.560
That means there's not a whole lot of green in his ears.

119
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.210
There's a little bit but there's definitely not a whole lot of blue.

120
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.490
So again here we're displaying the three different channels as grayscale.

121
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.310
So this is red because it's the first one we index at zero.

122
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.920
This is green.

123
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.630
The second one we know that one.

124
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.280
And this is blue.

125
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.750
We indexed at two.

126
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.380
So again take a look back at the slides of what is an image to better understand what these three images

127
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.670
are actually showing you because it's kind of hard to understand without the full context of the what

128
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.260
is an image lecture.

129
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:14.760
OK.

130
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.680
Now back to the task at hand.

131
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:26.650
Let's imagine that I actually made all these values zero which means I said the following.

132
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:35.910
I'm going to grab my pick read and I'm going to say everything in the green channel.

133
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.430
If we just take a look at this we have all these values from 0 to 255.

134
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.400
We're going to set these all equal to zero and to zero them out.

135
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.850
So now I've completely gotten rid of the green channel.

136
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.950
So let's see what our picture now looks like.

137
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.840
Well say guilty and show pick red and then that is that it looks a lot stranger.

138
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.150
In fact it looks a lot more purple ish.

139
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:07.090
And that's because the only two colors that are left are blue and red which together make purple.

140
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.820
So now we're basically seeing everything without the color green.

141
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:17.090
Now let's take this a step further and remove the contribution from blue.

142
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:23.450
So we're going to do here again say pick red and I'm going to grab all the pixels.

143
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.180
It's not going to grab them in the index to channel which is the blue channel because it goes red green

144
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.400
blue and orange going set that to zero.

145
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.940
And now when I see pink red again I've completely gotten rid of blue essentially now there's no more

146
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.580
purple.

147
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.790
And we're seeing the red channel completely.

148
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.380
Something to keep in mind is this pick red.

149
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:48.180
It's shape is still three channels across.

150
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:54.810
So a lot of times students are a bit confused as to what's the difference between pick red here versus

151
00:10:55.170 --> 00:11:00.120
the pick read that we were seeing earlier when we actually just grabbed the one and that's because we're

152
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.770
seeing all three channels at once instead of just one channel.

153
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.210
So if I were to take the shape of this guy this is just 13:00 by 1950.

154
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.640
So this is just one single channel and if I do the same for the other ones the shape doesn't change

155
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.750
when I say pick red without any indexing.

156
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:24.270
It still has information for all three channels except cleverly we went ahead and zeroed out the green

157
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.260
channel as well as the blue channel which is why this picture only shows up with the red.

158
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.260
OK.

159
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:36.110
So I know that was a bit complicated because of the indexing of all but the actual idea is quite simple.

Essentially we know the image has three channels a red one agree on it and a blue one.

161
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.590
We changed all the values in the green channel and the blue channel.

162
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.800
Those two layers.

163
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:51.030
We made them all zero which means we basically told the image hey there's no longer any contribution

164
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.820
from green and also no longer any contribution from blue.

165
00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:00.600
So then when the image or Kilty was asked hey can you show me what this adjusted image looks like.

166
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.480
It could only show what was in the existing red channel which is why everything's now colored red that's

167
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.310
different than what we did before which was color mapping a single channel to grayscale.

168
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.110
OK.

169
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.010
If you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums but definitely do another Watching of

170
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.330
the what is an image.

171
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.620
To further understand what's going on here.

172
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.150
Thanks.

173
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.320
And we'll see you at the next lecture.
