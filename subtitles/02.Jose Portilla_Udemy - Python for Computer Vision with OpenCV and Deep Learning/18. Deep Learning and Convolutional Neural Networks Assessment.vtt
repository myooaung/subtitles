00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.000
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to do an overview of the assessment for this section of the

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.890
course.

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.400
Let's open up the deep learning computer vision assessment notebook and do a quick overview.

4
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.970
All right here we have opened the notebook.

5
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.840
The LCB assessment and your challenge is to build an image classifier with carers and convolutional

6
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.960
neural networks on what's known as the fashion and this data set this data set includes 10 labels of

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.750
different clothing types and similar to the emd the state is set for numbers.

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.490
These are 28 by 28 greyscale images and there's a training set of 60000 images and 10000 test images.

9
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.200
So you can see here the labels 01 all the way through nine and the description.

10
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.410
So their T-shirts pullovers shoes sneakers bags et cetera.

11
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.340
So go ahead and load the data.

12
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.350
Here's the code to load it.

13
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.900
We went ahead and left that for you then you'll be visualizing the data.

14
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.980
So I wanted to use Map live to view an image from the data set.

15
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.350
It can be any image from a dataset.

16
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.190
So here's an example one you can clearly see here that does some sort of boots or sneaker.

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.250
We want to preprocess the data so you should normalize the X-rays and X test data set by dividing by

18
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.380
the max value of the image arrays.

19
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.760
Then you should reshape the X-rays to include a fourth dimension of the single channel.

20
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.040
Similar to what we did for the numbers and this data set.

21
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.770
Then convert the white train and white test values to be 100 coded for categorical analysis by care.

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.430
So that will be the two categorical function that we imported.

23
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.820
They don't want you to build a model.

24
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.270
And so using KERS I want you to build a model where we have a two day convolutional with filters 32

25
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.210
and kernel size of four by four.

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.070
A pooling layer where they're pulling sizes two by two a flattened layer then a layer of 128 neurons

27
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.190
and a final that's layer a 10 year olds.

28
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.210
Keep in mind these are just my suggestions.

29
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.620
You can feel free to experiment and you can check out the summary here in case you want an X for reference.

30
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.920
Then train and fit the model to the train set the number of epoxies is up to you.

31
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.710
In this example we train to 10 epochs and we're able to get around 95 percent accuracy.

32
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.580
Then you should evaluate the model.

33
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.350
So at the end you should be able to show the accuracy precision.

34
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.220
Recall an F1 score the model achieved on the X test data.

35
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.650
So there's lots of ways to do this.

36
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.530
You can check out and follow pretty much the same procedure was shown in the very first lecture you

37
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.180
should get something that more or less ends up looking like this.

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.870
OK.

39
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.130
So best of luck on this assessment.

40
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.570
Try not to reference the notes as much as you can but if you do get stuck feel free to reference the

41
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.880
previous lectures or if you really get stuck just go to the next lecture or we go over the solution

42
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.430
a reference that as a coatl on thanks and we'll see at the next lecture where we go over the solutions.
