00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,880
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to discuss contour detection contours are defined as simply

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,790
a curve joining all the continuous points along the boundary having the same color or same intensity

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,230
contours are a very useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

4
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,790
OPEC has a built in counter finder function that can also help us differentiate between internal and

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,110
external contours.

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,350
It has a lot of functionality packed into just a simple function call.

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,150
Let's go ahead and take a look.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,040
All right here we are at the Jupiter notebook.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm going to read in from my data folder an image called internal underscore external.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,780
So if you start typing I end you should see internal underscore external that PMG.

11
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,610
And as the second argument is going to pass and is 0 to read it in as a grayscale.

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,100
And if we check the shape of the image notice it's just x and y.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,490
There is no color channels.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,390
So let's see what this image actually looks like.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,100
And I'm going to map this in grayscale and it's a pretty simple image.

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,590
The main thing I notice here is that we have and triangle and the foreground space is white and the

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,780
background is black.

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,310
Then what's interesting is you have a smiley face with two black circles for eyes and a black circle

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,090
here for the mouth.

20
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,520
And then we have kind of like a pizza pie shape here with a bunch of pepperoni on it.

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,030
And what we're going to do is we're going to be able to find and extract contours.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,690
What's really cool and interesting about the fine contours function of open C.V is that it can actually

23
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:40,990
detect internal contours such as these pepperoni slices or the eyes or the smiley face versus external

24
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,290
contours such as the circle the triangle or this circle of a wedge cut out of it.

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,970
And what we're going to do is we're going to find the contours function and then we do this is we simply

26
00:01:51,970 --> 00:02:00,640
say CB2 dots find contours and you can have autocomplete that you passen the image that you want to

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,440
analyze.

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,310
And there's a couple of different metrics or ways to actually find contours.

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,160
So there's a built in functions and if you say CB2 thought are ETR underscore and then hit TAB there'll

30
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,330
be some different ways here to actually find the contours.

31
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,460
So what we're going to be using is c c o MP.

32
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,590
So complete.

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,320
And what this does is it's going to extract both internal and external contours organized in a two level

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,160
hierarchy.

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,360
They can then index and call off of.

36
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,320
If you're only interested in internal contours or external contours there's other methods here.

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,760
For example you can use external to only grab external contours.

38
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,840
Right now we're just these this complete one that grabs all the contours for us and the third parameter

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,270
here.

40
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,920
If you do shift tab that's going to be the actual method.

41
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,520
We're just going to be using chaine underscore approx.

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,750
Underscore simple as our method.

43
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,580
OK.

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,300
And this is actually going to return back a few objects.

45
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:08,960
It returns back an image the contours themselves and then the hierarchy that organizes them the hierarchy

46
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,070
depends on actually what type you call.

47
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,420
But in this case it's we're calling for both internal and external contours We're also going to return

48
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,420
to a hierarchy here.

49
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,490
So let's run that.

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,500
Let's check out what these actual objects are.

51
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,160
If we look at the type of contours it's a list and then the length of contours is 22.

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,630
And if you were to count out these actual contours such as the number of pepperoni slices the circles

53
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,280
the eyes and the smiley face you would get 22 contours.

54
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:45,760
And if we check up the type of hierarchy so check out that hierarchy is a pie array and if we actually

55
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,030
show you what it looks like it's essentially a bunch of lines that find where the contours are.

56
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,980
And then a parameter that actually defines whether they're internal or external.

57
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:02,020
So let me show you how you can actually then use contours here and hierarchy here to show external contours

58
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,750
versus internal contours.

59
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,880
It's a bit strange because it kind of have to know the way it's organized.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,080
So we provided some code for you in the note book that that way you can just have that skeleton code

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,330
to reference.

62
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:20,470
So I will set up an empty array and I'm going to call this empty courageous external contours and this

63
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,510
is going to be just zeros in the same shape as the image.

64
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,850
And it can be image or I m g doesn't really matter.

65
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,870
So same thing.

66
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,830
So if I check out external contours shape there it is 6 5 2 1 0 8.

67
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,530
And if we check out the original shape 6 5 to 180.

68
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,310
OK so the image returned back.

69
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,740
That's basically the same thing.

70
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,330
In fact we can actually show it image here.

71
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,810
It's essentially the same thing.

72
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,330
OK.

73
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,700
So now that we have this and zeros this is going to be external contours just a pure black in the same

74
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,440
shape as the original image.

75
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,450
Now what I want to do is actually draw the contours on and there's a draw contrast function with an

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,520
open CD.

77
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,920
The only thing is I have to know how to actually read and understand this list of contours using the

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,230
hierarchy.

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
So we are going to do.

80
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,360
And typically you don't really memorize this you just reference it from either documentation or notes

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,900
like the ones we provide for you.

82
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,270
We're going to say for I in range of length of contours.

83
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,060
So remember I in range of length of contours if we actually check what this is by passing this in to

84
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,290
a list that's just a list number so for 0 1 2 3 4 5 all the way to 21 the length contours because since

85
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,210
we have 22 are we're also counting 0.

86
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,620
That works out.

87
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,090
So we have four in range of length of contours

88
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,560
hierarchy and then we're going to do a little bit of indexing here.

89
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,740
We're going to say zero.

90
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,270
I 3 and then equals equals negative 1.

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,470
Essentially what that is doing is its indexing for each of these rows.

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,180
This last column right here.

93
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,130
This negative 1 or 0.

94
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,910
So Or it can also be 4 depending on what type of contour it is.

95
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,500
Again we're just checking out the last column here.

96
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,970
That's what this indexing is doing.

97
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,830
And with the eye it's doing it for every single row.

98
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,990
So we're checking if the hierarchy value at that 2 column is equal to negative 1 then that means as

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,850
an external contour.

100
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,900
So it's external If it's not equal to negative 1 than it's internal.

101
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,380
So we have negative one there.

102
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,060
It's an external contour.

103
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:46,660
And then what we're going to do is say to draw contours and we're going to draw external contours

104
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:59,640
contours and then I to find find for white and then negative once it's actually filled in.

105
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,690
So let's run that.

106
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:06,860
So what this did is it went through that contours list and that checked hey if the hierarchy for that

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,870
corresponding contour and if we actually check out the list of contours we can show you these are essentially

108
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,490
just arrays that define how to actually draw the contours.

109
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,130
So it's saying okay for that contours check of the hierarchy is good if it is then onto this black external

110
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,090
contours member that's the zeroes here.

111
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,860
Go ahead and draw that specific contour and then we'll be able to view it.

112
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,700
So let's actually view the external contours.

113
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:37,460
We'll say PBT and show external contours and let's make the map great.

114
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,990
And here with the fine contours and the hierarchy where it's equal to negative one it actually detected

115
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,700
the external contours.

116
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,890
So these are things that are actually directly touching what it believes to be the background.

117
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,620
So this triangle the circle and the circle with the slice taken out of it.

118
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,110
Those are all external contours because their boundary is touching the actual background.

119
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,490
Now the internal contours were things like it come back to the original image.

120
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,950
These guys right here the pepperoni slices and the eyes and the smiley face the edges of those contours.

121
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,760
They're actually not touching the background they're touching a foreground object.

122
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,200
So those are known as internal contours and all we can do is essentially run this exact code.

123
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,680
But then instead of words equal to negative one we're saying not equal to negative one so I'm also going

124
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,110
to redefine this external contours but we're going to make it internal.

125
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,170
So let's grab that pace right here.

126
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,790
And we will say internal contours.

127
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,400
So basically following the same process and creating a default black object that I can draw on just

128
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:50,270
an array and then for all the contours what I'm doing is for internal.

129
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,450
What I will say is that third column is not equal to negative one that it's an internal contour.

130
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,290
And I'm going to draw onto my internal contour and let me make sure I have the right internal contours

131
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,980
contours twenty five.

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,130
So let's go ahead and run that and then let's show the internal contours internal contours.

133
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,500
See map is equal to grey.

134
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,400
Run that and then it went ahead and displayed the internal contours and there you have it.

135
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,060
So that's how you can actually then use find contours and draw contours to display contours.

136
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,330
The last thing I want to actually note here is the way that works with the hierarchy.

137
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,390
It can actually then define this set of contours as different than the smiley face.

138
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:44,330
And if you come back up here you'll notice that in the last third column we have negative ones.

139
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,000
Those are the external contours.

140
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,930
We have these three zeros.

141
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:55,090
Those are the eyes and smiley face of the world the smiley face of the actual smile.

142
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,300
And then we have four.

143
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,070
Those are all the pepperoni slices.

144
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,950
So you'll notice they're actually numbers them differently depending on a grouping of internal contours

145
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,080
So if they're within different external contours it will group them differently.

146
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,540
So what I would encourage you to do is we can then test on this by saying only give me where it equals

147
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,350
four and let's rerun this again.

148
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,980
So we're going to say now let's redefine going to rerun the cell external contours check the shape again.

149
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,870
That's looking good.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,470
And I'm only going to do it where it equals four and then let's see how that works.

151
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,660
So those are all the pepperoni slices.

152
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,230
Now let's try again but this time I'm going to choose just where two equals zero.

153
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,590
So we will say zero there.

154
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,770
Let's rerun this so we get the fresh background run these again.

155
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,090
And now I only get the smiley faces.

156
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:51,250
So it's really cool is not only does it give you organization between internal and external contours

157
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,920
it also gives you organization within the internal contours themselves depending on what external countered

158
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,300
they were found inside.

159
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,310
So that way may be fuel for some reason only wanted to display the internal contours of a particular

160
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,990
object such as a smiley face.

161
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,620
You can go ahead and do that.

162
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,440
OK.

163
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,010
So that's it for this lecture.

164
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,740
And we'll see you at the next one.
