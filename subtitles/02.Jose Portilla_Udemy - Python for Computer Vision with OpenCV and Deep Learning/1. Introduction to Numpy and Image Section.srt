Welcome everyone to our first technical section of the course where we're going to be discussing PI

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,790
and image basics our section goals are to understand how to work with the basics of pie and them pineries

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,540
arrays.

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,420
We also want to understand how to create a variety of arrays and how to slice and index elements from

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,200
arrays.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,700
Since we'll be mainly we're presenting images as arrays when working in images with Python.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,330
Then finally we also want to understand how to open and display images with some pie later on we'll

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,590
expand this to also use open C-v.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,210
All right let's get started.

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,270
I'll see you at the next lecture.
