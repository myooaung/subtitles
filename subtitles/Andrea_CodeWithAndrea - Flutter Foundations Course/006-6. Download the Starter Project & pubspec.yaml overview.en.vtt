1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.499
- Now that I've told you

2
00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:03.840
where to find the official GitHub report,

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.210
it's time for you to
download this starter project

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.100
that we will use for this course.

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.260
So, if you look at the
resources in this lesson

6
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.100
you'll find this file called
ecommerce app section one.

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.170
So make sure to download this file

8
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.210
and extract it on your system.

9
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.050
And, once you have done that,
you can open it in vscode.

10
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.270
And just to be clear,
you should consider this

11
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.760
to be a starting point
that we will build upon

12
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.260
for the rest of the course.

13
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.810
But, of course, as we make
progress you may be tempted

14
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.280
to try out different things.

15
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.710
And by all means, you're
welcome to experiment

16
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.840
with this code as much as you want.

17
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.850
However, this also means
that you may end up

18
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.920
with a project that no longer compiles,

19
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.470
or is not in line with
the content of the course.

20
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.630
For this reason, at the
beginning of which section,

21
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.090
I will share some updated code snapshots,

22
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.790
so that you can get a
working project that compiles

23
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.320
and runs without errors.

24
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.060
And now that I've clarified this,

25
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.853
let me give you an overview
about this starter project.

26
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.440
This project was generated
using Flutter 3.0 and is based

27
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.660
on a well known flutter skeleton template

28
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.560
that serves as a good starting
point for new Flutter apps.

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.300
And a good place to start is to open

30
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.490
the pubspec dot yami file.

31
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.350
And what you'll find
here is that this project

32
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.050
is based on Dart version two point 18,

33
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.570
which is first launched with Flutter 3.3.

34
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.150
So, make sure that you're
running on Flutter 3.3 or above,

35
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.590
if you want to run this.

36
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.120
And as part of this startup project,

37
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.790
I've also included a very
small number of packages,

38
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.590
including flutter launcher icons,

39
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.082
which is used to create the app icon

40
00:01:31.082 --> 00:01:33.030
for iOS and under Android,
along with the intl package

41
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.820
which is used for some simple
date and currency formatting.

42
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.250
And I've also included a
couple of small UI packages

43
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.770
called flutter layout grid
and flutter rating bar.

44
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.440
And I'll show you where they're
used in the coming lessons.

45
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.870
And if you take a look at
the dev dependencies section,

46
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.790
you'll find the flutter lints package

47
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.070
which enables all the
recommended Linter rules

48
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.210
for this project.

49
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.190
And this is based on version 2.0

50
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.220
which was also launched
alongside Flutter 3.

51
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.190
And if we scroll down, we
find all these directives

52
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.723
for generating the app
icon, as well as this option

53
00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:05.286
which is used to generate
localized strings for the project.

54
00:02:05.286 --> 00:02:08.460
And I've also added this
assets slash products folder

55
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.200
that contains all the product images

56
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.420
that we will need when
running the application.

57
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.940
In fact, if you want,
you can open this folder

58
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.580
and you can see what all
these products look like.

59
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.130
And of course, if you
build a real eCommerce app,

60
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.470
you wouldn't just bundle
all the product images

61
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.850
in the app itself,

62
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.670
instead you would load them
dynamically from the network.

63
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.320
But, since we are just getting started,

64
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.180
we are not going to worry about this,

65
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.890
and we will see how to load images

66
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.333
from the network later on.

67
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.100
Okay, so let's get back to
the pubspec dot yami file.

68
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.380
And at this stage we can already go ahead

69
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.243
and get all the latest packages.

70
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.500
And when we are done with
this, we can run the app

71
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.690
to make sure that
everything works correctly.

72
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.570
And at this stage, we can run
on all the different platforms

73
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.400
that are supported by Flutter.

74
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.020
So, whether you want to develop on

75
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.740
iOS, Android, Chrome,
macOS, Windows, or Linux,

76
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.420
it's completely up to you.

77
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.160
And in fact, all the code and packages

78
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.540
that we will use in this course

79
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.270
will be compatible with
all these platforms.

80
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.430
In fact, for the best
developer experience,

81
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.800
I recommend you to choose
either Windows or macOS,

82
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.570
depending on your operating system,

83
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.330
because these targets
are very easy to spin up

84
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.640
and they don't use too
many system resources.

85
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.245
And on top of that,

86
00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:20.550
the app that we will use
is completely responsive,

87
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.190
so you'll find it easier
to run it on desktop.

88
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.560
So, in my case, I can use macOS

89
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.960
and press F5 to run the app.

90
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.670
And as for you, feel free to select

91
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.970
your target of choice
and run the app as well.

92
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.110
This will take a few seconds
and once the build is complete

93
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.990
you should see the app running over here.

94
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.820
With that said, I want to point out

95
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.200
that if you're trying to run the app

96
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.750
on iOS or macOS for the first time,

97
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.090
then you're likely to get
this error telling you

98
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.957
that this sandbox is not in
sync with the pod file dot lock

99
00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:53.922
and suggesting to run pod install

100
00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:56.610
or update your CocoaPods installation.

101
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.410
And whenever you get errors like this

102
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.440
it's always a good idea to
look at the console log.

103
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.060
In fact, in this case, we are told

104
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.120
that we need to run pod
install to solve this problem.

105
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.370
So, let's do that by opening the terminal.

106
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.650
And from here we can
move to the iOS folder

107
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.650
by typing cd ios, and then we
can run pod install like this.

108
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.810
And after we are done with this,

109
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.390
we can try to run the app again

110
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.140
and wait for the build to complete.

111
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.730
And this time we should manage
to get it running, over here.

112
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.760
And if for some reason the build
still doesn't work for you,

113
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.070
then make sure to check
the notes in this lesson

114
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.460
where I've listed solutions
to some common build errors.

115
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.620
In fact, I suggest that
you always check the notes

116
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.610
in the course lessons,

117
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.650
as they may contain some
additional information

118
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.350
or clarify some questions
that you may have.

119
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.750
All right, so let's
continue on the next lesson.
