1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.820
- In this lesson, I want
to talk about localization.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.300
And this is an important topic

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.940
if you want your app to
support multiple languages.

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.430
And this is one of those things

5
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.600
that you should really plan
out and design from the start.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.870
Because if you ignore this

7
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.660
and try to add localization
at the end of the project,

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.160
then you'll have a lot more work to do.

9
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.020
Luckily, any project that was created

10
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.000
with a flutter skeleton
template is already configured

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.980
for localization by default.

12
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.280
And once the basic configuration is done,

13
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.010
you'll find a folder called localization

14
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.970
where you can add an IRB file,

15
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.040
which is nothing more than a
JSON file with key value pairs

16
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.150
representing all the localized strings

17
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.710
that you want to use in the project.

18
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.420
And when you start a new project

19
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.230
with the flutter skeleton template

20
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.120
then this file only
contains a couple of values.

21
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.440
But I've already gone
through the process of adding

22
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.780
all the localized strings

23
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.060
that we may need in this project.

24
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.200
Now, the process for adding localization

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.200
is already explained in
the official documentation.

26
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.240
And I've also written this tutorial

27
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.070
which presents a simplified approach

28
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.270
that you can follow in your own apps.

29
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.510
So if you want to learn more,

30
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.630
you can read through this tutorial.

31
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.000
And the bottom line of this

32
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.210
is that once you've set everything up,

33
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.600
you can type up localization of context

34
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.670
to access all the localized
strings that you need

35
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.310
and use them in your widgets.

36
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.510
However, I feel that
dealing with localization

37
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.430
at this point in time would
make it more difficult for you

38
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.600
to work out which strings
are used in which widgets.

39
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.130
And for now, I think it's important

40
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.400
that you're able to find
your way around the codebase

41
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.040
without having to worry
about localization.

42
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.420
For this reason, I've decided
to leave hardcoded strings

43
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.253
inside the widgets,

44
00:01:36.253 --> 00:01:38.940
and I hope that this will
make life easier for you.

45
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.940
As an example of this,

46
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.800
we can open the leave review screen widget

47
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.056
that we have already seen
in the previous lesson.

48
00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:48.950
And we can locate this string
that says, "Leave a review".

49
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.380
And as you can see, there
is one small caveat.

50
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.540
And that is that every time

51
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.610
you encounter a hardcoded string,

52
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.537
you see that it has this
.hardcoded suffix at the end.

53
00:01:58.537 --> 00:02:00.336
And the reason that I've added this

54
00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:03.970
is that if we want, we can
do a project-wide search

55
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.390
for .hardcoded and find
all the places in the code

56
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.635
where there are strings that
need to be localized later.

57
00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:13.430
And if you want to find
out how this is defined,

58
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.236
you can go to the definition
and here you can see

59
00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.442
that I've defined an
extension on the string type.

60
00:02:19.442 --> 00:02:22.814
And all I do inside is to
define this get variable

61
00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:25.530
that does nothing other than return this

62
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.830
which represents the string itself.

63
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.130
So once again, this is just a placeholder

64
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.490
that doesn't modify the string in anyway

65
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.180
and it is useful to locate
all the hardcoded strings

66
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.660
in the project.

67
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.330
So once again, we won't be
dealing with localization

68
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.410
at this stage so that we can
focus on more important things.

69
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.370
But I just wanted to include this lesson

70
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.410
to tell you about it because
localization is fairly simple

71
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.727
and you shouldn't ignore
it in your own apps.

72
00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:53.460
Okay, so this wraps up this
first section of the course

73
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.270
and I feel that even though we
haven't written any code yet,

74
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.380
we've already covered
some interesting stuff.

75
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.140
For example, how to use the DevTools

76
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.750
to more quickly get familiar
with a new codebase.

77
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.400
And we have talked about composition

78
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.230
and its importance when
building reusable widgets.

79
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.320
And we have also seen
that we can go a long way

80
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.180
in making our apps responsive

81
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.679
without having to rely
on third-party packages.

82
00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.370
And like I said before,

83
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.060
I encourage you to explore
these codebase on your own

84
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.550
and see if you can understand
how it all fits together

85
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.223
from a high level point of view.

86
00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:24.060
However, if there is anything

87
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.670
that is not clear at this
stage, then don't worry,

88
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.230
because we'll spend a lot of
time working on this project

89
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.010
and I'll make sure to explain
things as we go along.

90
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.950
In fact, in the next section,
we will talk about navigation,

91
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.410
and migrate this project from
Navigator 1.0 to GoRouter,

92
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.040
and this will be a great opportunity

93
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.323
to understand how all these
screens are connected together.
