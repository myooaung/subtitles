1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
- In this, we're going
to continue our migration

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.260
from NAV 1.0 to GoRouter

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.420
and see how to work with multiple routes.

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.160
And one important thing to understand is

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.560
that GoRouter has a the declarative API

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.450
meaning that we can define
all the routes we need

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.580
inside a single GoRouter object.

8
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.280
And in fact, we only
need one GoRouter object

9
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.840
for the entire application.

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.060
And since we need to define
all the routes inside it

11
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.950
I propose that we move this object

12
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.160
into a separate file that will
contain all the routing code.

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.440
So at this stage we
can create a new folder

14
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.000
inside source and we can
call this routing like this.

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.516
And then inside it we can
create a new file called

16
00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:37.680
app router dot dart like this.

17
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.350
And then we can get back
to our app dart file.

18
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.770
And here we can select
the entire GoRouter code

19
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.300
and then we can cut it

20
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.820
and then we can past
it inside the new file.

21
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.680
And of course, in order
for this to compile

22
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.730
we need to import GoRouter dot dart

23
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.900
as well as the file that
contains our product

24
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.763
this screen widget like this.

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.130
And after we set this file,

26
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.360
we can get back to the up dot dart file

27
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.360
and then all we have to do is

28
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.080
to select this line
which contains an error

29
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.192
and we can just fix it

30
00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:09.330
by importing the new up router dot file,

31
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.650
just like this.

32
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.240
So all we have done here is to move

33
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.610
the declaration of this GoRouter object

34
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.300
into this new file where it is
defined as a global variable.

35
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.760
And one thing that you may wonder is

36
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.280
whether this should be a global variable

37
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.200
or whether it will be better to declare

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.300
in some other way and make it accessible

39
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.350
to the rest of the app

40
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.570
through some dependency injection system.

41
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.190
And at this stage, I think it's best

42
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.240
if we follow the KISS principle
and keep things simple.

43
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.690
Besides that, we only need
one instance of this object

44
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.240
and the only place where it's ever used is

45
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.660
as an argument to our
material app over here.

46
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.060
In fact, we will see that
our widgets will never

47
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.550
need to access this object directory.

48
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.530
So it's really unnecessary to worry about

49
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.390
dependency injection at this date

50
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.070
and a simple global variable.

51
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.380
We'll do just fine for now.

52
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.530
With that set, we will
revisit this choice later on.

53
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.260
In fact, at some point we will
add some extra functionality

54
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.324
to our app and add some dependencies

55
00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:09.720
that we will use to implement
some redirection logic.

56
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.450
But once again, this
is good enough for now.

57
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.890
Okay, so let's carry on.

58
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.230
And our next goal is
to add some new routes

59
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.740
and learn how to use the
GoRouter API to navigate to them.

60
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.740
For example, we can see
that from this page.

61
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.380
There are a number of other
pages that we can get to,

62
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.380
such as the product page as
well as the shopping cart

63
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.260
and the orders page and
the account page as well.

64
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.700
So we can choose any of this.

65
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.390
And I think a good one to get
started is the shopping cart.

66
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.600
This means that our immediate
goal is to define a new route

67
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.780
for the shopping card page,
as well as navigate to it

68
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.550
using the GoRouter API

69
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.710
rather than using navigator dot push.

70
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.510
So let's figure this out.

71
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.760
And the simplest way for us
to add a new route here is

72
00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:59.040
to copy and paste the existing route,

73
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.900
and then we can change the path here

74
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.840
to something like slash cart like this.

75
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.820
And we also change the value returned

76
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.900
by this pillar to return
a shopping cart screen

77
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.480
which is the widget that
represents this page.

78
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.810
And of course, in order to use
this, we need to import it.

79
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.180
And now that we have defined this route,

80
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.760
we need to locate the code
that is used to navigate

81
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.380
to the shopping cart.

82
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.740
So let's use the find
explorer to find this

83
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.930
and then we can open the features folder

84
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.903
and the home up bar
folder, which is inside it.

85
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.163
And as we can see here, we have
a shopping cart icon widget.

86
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.930
And the purpose of this
widget is to show these icon

87
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.180
with the number of items in the cart.

88
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.860
And if we look at the build method

89
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.970
we can find out that
when this icon is pressed

90
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.490
then we make this code
to navigator of context

91
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.430
dot push in order to show
this shopping cart screen

92
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.200
as a full screen dialogue.

93
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.700
So let's see if we can figure out

94
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.420
how to replace this code
and use GoRouter instead.

95
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.850
So what we can do is to comment out

96
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.360
this entire block of code

97
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.610
and instead we can define
the impressed callback

98
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.747
to return GoRouter,
which we need to import.

99
00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:16.740
And then we can type of context like this.

100
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.810
And then we can type Go

101
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.443
and we can see that

102
00:04:20.443 --> 00:04:21.276
two (indistinct)

103
00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:22.109
are suggested

104
00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.970
and these are called Go and Go named

105
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.190
and we'll talk about
their differences shortly.

106
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.260
But for now, we are just going to use Go

107
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.630
and we need to pass an
argument that represents

108
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.030
the location that we want to navigate to.

109
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.014
And this location should match the path

110
00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:37.800
that we have defined over here.

111
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.410
So we can copy slash cart from here

112
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.140
and we can paste it in here like this.

113
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.510
And then we can save this file

114
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.493
and we can see if our code works.

115
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.150
And since we changed a few
things, it's probably a good idea

116
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.940
if we do a hot start at this stage

117
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.100
then we can get back to our app.

118
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.020
And if we press on this button

119
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.540
we can see that we are
taken to the shopping cart.

120
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.570
However, the back button
has disappeared, meaning

121
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.630
that we no longer have a way
to get back to the homepage.

122
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.870
So this is not quite right,
but on the plus side,

123
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.410
we can see that the other
bar now has a trailing cart

124
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.310
at the end.

125
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.100
And if we remove this and hit enter

126
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.260
then we are taken back to the homepage.

127
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.230
All right, so let's figure
out how to fix our navigation.

128
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.120
Once again, our main problem is that

129
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.863
we don't have a back pattern

130
00:05:25.863 --> 00:05:27.480
when we move to the shopping cart.

131
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.660
And if we get back to
our up router dot start,

132
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.070
we cannot one thing.

133
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.180
And that is that these two
routes are actually siblings

134
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.120
meaning that they are both
top level routes that live

135
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.340
inside this GoRouter object.

136
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.890
However, does this really make sense?

137
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.890
Should the shopping cart be
a sibling of the main route

138
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.650
or should it be a sub
route that is defined with

139
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.780
a parent and child relationship?

140
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.210
And to answer that question,
we need to understand

141
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.350
that from the shopping cart,

142
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.790
it should always be possible

143
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.980
to navigate back to the homepage.

144
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.150
And if we use GoRouter,

145
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.450
this concept can be expressed
by using sub routes.

146
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.880
So let's go ahead and modify this code.

147
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.200
And what we want to do is
to nest a new route argument

148
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.050
inside this GoRouter.

149
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.430
So let's create an empty list over here

150
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.470
and then what we can do
is to take this route

151
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.753
and move it inside it like this.

152
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.530
And now that we have
saved and (indistinct),

153
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.420
we can see that we are actually getting

154
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.370
a blank page over here.

155
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.713
And if we open the debug console,

156
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.807
we notice that we have an error about

157
00:06:34.807 --> 00:06:37.650
"no media query widget ancestor found".

158
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.290
And while this is not particularly helpful

159
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.260
we need to realize that over
here we have just declared

160
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.840
this path using a forward slash.

161
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.880
However, this is not the right thing to do

162
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.590
when we define sub route.

163
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.900
And instead we should
remove the forward slash

164
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.817
and just use Cart instead.

165
00:06:53.817 --> 00:06:56.760
Because it is GoRouter's job to work out

166
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.210
the complete part that
leads to a certain URL

167
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.090
by appending the individual
parts that are found

168
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.050
along the way.

169
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.660
And in fact, if we add
together this forward slash

170
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.770
and the card string, we
find exactly this location

171
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.950
which is what we have specified
when we try to navigate.

172
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.820
So at this stage,

173
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.490
we should be able to
save and (indistinct).

174
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.980
And as we can see, the
shopping cart page now

175
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.860
has a back button and
we can navigate to it

176
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.860
and get back to the homepage as we should.

177
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.980
So while all we are done
here is to enable navigation

178
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.470
for just one page, we have already started

179
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.230
to explore concepts such as sub routes

180
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.110
and how to do navigation
using the GoRouter API

181
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.750
rather than using navigator dot push.

182
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.132
So let's continue on the next lesson

183
00:07:41.132 --> 00:07:43.743
where we will explore
things more in detail.
