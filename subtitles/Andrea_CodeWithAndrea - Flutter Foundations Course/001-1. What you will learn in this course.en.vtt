00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.770
- Hello, and welcome to this course

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.330
where you will learn how to
build real world Flutter apps.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.530
I created this course

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.870
because I feel that there
is a big knowledge gap

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.820
between knowing how to
build UIs in Flutter

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.720
and how to build complete applications

7
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.330
that solve real problems.

8
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.190
And I think that this knowledge gap

9
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.790
stems from a misconception
where some people think

10
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.760
that by just knowing how to use Flutter,

11
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.590
they automatically know about
application development.

12
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.370
Whereas this couldn't be
further from the truth

13
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.070
because application
development is a complex topic

14
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.650
with a bigger learning curve

15
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.490
than what you need to learn Flutter alone.

16
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.700
Of course, if you spend some
time building UIs in Flutter,

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.380
you'll know about the Widget Tree

18
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.660
and how anything that
gets rendered on screen

19
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.720
is just a composition of different widgets

20
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.490
that you arrange to get
the layout that you want.

21
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.410
But that is just the tip of the iceberg.

22
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.650
And what lies underneath

23
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.330
is the entire scope of
application development,

24
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.340
which includes things
like state management,

25
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.910
app architecture, navigation, testing,

26
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.750
error handling, networking, and so on.

27
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.130
And even then, this only covers
the frontend side of things

28
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.850
but real apps often need
additional capabilities

29
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.260
such as authentication, a remote database,

30
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.580
cloud functions, third party integrations,

31
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.610
and other concerns that
belong to the realm

32
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.250
of backend development.

33
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.083
And further still,

34
00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:17.820
if you want to run your apps in production

35
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.000
so that they can be used by real users,

36
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.830
you'll get a lot of value by
automating the entire process

37
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.850
of testing and releasing your apps,

38
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.540
which can and will be the
topic of an entire course.

39
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.400
In summary, app development is hard.

40
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.790
And because different apps
have different requirements,

41
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850
it takes a lot of practice and experience

42
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.810
to master this complex topic.

43
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.850
And the goal of this course

44
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.430
is to prepare you for
real world app development

45
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.350
so that you can learn

46
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.900
how to build complex apps with confidence.

47
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.910
In other words, this first course

48
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.650
is all about professional
application development.

49
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.890
And we'll focus specifically
on the frontend side of things

50
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.770
when building Flutter apps.

51
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.890
Some of the sections in this
course will be very extensive.

52
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.950
For example, we will spend a lot of time

53
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.640
learning about state
management with Riverpod,

54
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.040
and just as much time covering
automated testing in Flutter

55
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.810
because this is an essential topic

56
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.230
if you want to build complex
apps that work reliably.

57
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.570
Speaking of complex apps,

58
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.660
we'll also cover domain driven design

59
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.480
and app architecture in detail

60
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.300
because as our code base grows,

61
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.000
it's very important to identify

62
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.010
different layers with clear boundaries

63
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.400
so that we have a good
separation of concerns

64
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.500
between different parts of the app.

65
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.040
And since building real apps

66
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.820
is one of the best ways to learn,

67
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.160
another goal of this course

68
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.400
is to build the frontend for
this eCommerce application,

69
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.300
which includes many interesting features

70
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.800
such as product listings, product details,

71
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.640
shopping cart, sign in
flows, and many more.

72
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.720
And as we build all
these different features,

73
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.200
we will hone our problem solving skills

74
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050
and gradually build some experience

75
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.720
and train our muscle memory

76
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.920
so that we get better and
better with every new challenge.

77
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.890
In fact, this is not the kind of course

78
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.270
where you just copy and
paste what I type on screen

79
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.060
without any explanation.

80
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.630
Instead, I will guide through
my decision making process

81
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.820
so that you can also become
an effective problem solver

82
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.090
that is well equipped with
the knowledge that you need

83
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.410
to build any kind of app in Flutter.

84
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.670
So I hope that this has
given you a good overview

85
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.020
of what you'll be learning.

86
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.980
Sounds good?

87
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.323
Then let's get started.
