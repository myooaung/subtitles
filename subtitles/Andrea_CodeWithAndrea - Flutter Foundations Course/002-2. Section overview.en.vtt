00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.220
- In this lesson, I want to tell you

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.850
all about what we will cover

3
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.030
in this first section of the course.

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.360
And the most important thing

5
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.460
is that I will share a starter project

6
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.220
that we will use as a starting point

7
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.620
for the rest of the course.

8
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.690
And it's important that
you follow the lessons

9
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.760
in this section so that
you can more easily

10
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.370
find your way around.

11
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.290
Okay, so here is where we
are going to cover next.

12
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.520
First of all, we will look
at how you can customize

13
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.090
your development environment using S code

14
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.590
so that you can install
many useful extensions

15
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.850
that we will use in this course.

16
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.420
Then, I will introduce the
Slack channel for the course

17
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.885
because this is where you'll
be able to ask questions.

18
00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:37.920
And I'll also use this to post

19
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.380
all relevant course announcements.

20
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.250
I'll also share the official
GitHub repo for the course

21
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.940
and tell you how it is organized

22
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.090
and what other useful things
you'll find inside it.

23
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760
Then we'll move on to download

24
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.010
the starter project for the course.

25
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.270
This will include the
entire UI for the app

26
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.480
that we are going to build.

27
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.280
This will be a starting point
for all the remaining content.

28
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.600
And I want to give you a
good overview of the code

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720
so that you know where everything is.

30
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.160
And only after we have
completed this overview,

31
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.150
we will move on to the next section

32
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.400
where we will start the actual course

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.180
and learn about all the important topics

34
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.970
that I have planned for you.

35
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.773
All right, so let's get started.
