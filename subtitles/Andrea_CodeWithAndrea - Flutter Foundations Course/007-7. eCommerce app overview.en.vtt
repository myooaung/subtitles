1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.330
- By this point in time,

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.340
you should have this
e-commerce app running

3
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.770
on your chosen device.

4
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.460
So this is a good time to give you

5
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.630
a complete overview of this app

6
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.270
and show you what you can
do with it at this stage.

7
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.030
And as we will see why
we are able to navigate

8
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.350
across the different screens,

9
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.900
there is a lot of functionality

10
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.120
that is not implemented just yet.

11
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.650
So let's take a look.

12
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.950
And as you would expect, this
app is completely responsive

13
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.330
and adjusts itself based
on the size of the window.

14
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.920
All right, so on the initial screen,

15
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.030
you can find this grid of products.

16
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.480
And you also have this
search box at the top

17
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.000
that we will use to
enable product filtering.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.180
So if you try to type anything inside,

19
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.650
you'll see that nothing happens,

20
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.990
because we will only
implement functionality later.

21
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.290
So from here, we can select any product

22
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.520
and be taken to this product detail page,

23
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.320
where we can find a list of reviews.

24
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.420
And the purpose of this page is for you

25
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.650
to set a quantity and add
the product to the cart.

26
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.380
And if you click here, you'll
get an alert telling you

27
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.740
that this functionality is
not implemented just yet.

28
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.130
Though, what you can do
is to click on this button

29
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.220
to leave a review.

30
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740
And this will take you to this page,

31
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.353
where you can rate the
product and give a comment.

32
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.290
However, only the UI is updated

33
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.910
and you can't submit the review just yet.

34
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.200
So let's dismiss this page.

35
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.680
And instead we can click on this button

36
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.950
at the top that takes
us to the shopping cart.

37
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.290
And by default, this always
shows these three items,

38
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.440
and we are not able to
change their quantity

39
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.983
or delete them just yet.

40
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.210
So let's proceed to check out instead.

41
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.050
And over here, you'll be
prompted to create an account.

42
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.070
And for the time being,

43
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.473
you'll be able to enter unknown
empty, email and password.

44
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.920
But this won't create a
real account just yet.

45
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.050
And it will just take you to
this payment screen instead,

46
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.220
which shows a summary of
all the items in your cart.

47
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.210
And the checkout functionality
is also disabled.

48
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.180
So since there isn't anything
that we can do at this stage,

49
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.130
we can dismiss this page and
get back to the products list.

50
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.530
And from here, you'll be
able to click on this option

51
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.630
to show the list of orders.

52
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.110
And again, this is just some fake data

53
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.840
that we show in the UI, and
none of this is connected

54
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.560
to a real database yet.

55
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.390
So we can dismiss the page.

56
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.570
And the last thing that you can do,

57
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.010
is to click on this account screen.

58
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.870
And all this does, is to show
you the user ID and the email,

59
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.630
and it gives you an option to log out,

60
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.700
which is also not implemented.

61
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.120
So as you can see, you
can already use this app

62
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.450
to navigate between all
the different screens,

63
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.160
but the data that you
see is just hard-coded.

64
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.370
And many of the bottom
callbacks in the app

65
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.900
are not implemented and
only show you an alert.

66
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.760
So this starter project
is clearly incomplete,

67
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.750
and only represents the starting point

68
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.630
that we will is to turn
this into a real app.

69
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.030
And I should also point out

70
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.440
that while I made this upper responsive,

71
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.530
I haven't really spent
a lot of time building

72
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.320
a custom beautiful UI, because once again,

73
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.560
this is not the goal of this course.

74
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.710
On the other hand, this
startup project gives us

75
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.380
the scope to implement
many different features

76
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.780
without having to worry about the UI.

77
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.080
And as far as e-commerce applications go,

78
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.560
there are so many features
that you could implement

79
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.130
including multiple wishlists,
product recommendations,

80
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.780
categories, and advanced
filtering features.

81
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.750
And while we are not
going to write the code

82
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.370
for every possible
feature you can think of,

83
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.630
I will at least try to give you an idea

84
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.110
about how to approach them.

85
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.820
And maybe even give you some homework

86
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.190
so that you can try
out things on your own.

87
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.750
But before we get to that stage,

88
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.530
we first need to cover
all the fundamentals.

89
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.500
So let's continue on the next lesson,

90
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.800
where we will start
taking a look at the code.
