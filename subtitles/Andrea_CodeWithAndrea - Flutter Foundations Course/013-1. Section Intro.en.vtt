00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.720
- Welcome to this section of the course

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.840
which will be all about navigation.

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.210
And as part of this section

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.940
we will take the starter project

5
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.360
which currently uses
the navigator 1.0 APIs

6
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.550
and convert it to use GoRouter

7
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.480
which is an official routing package

8
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.580
that is now maintained
by the flutter core team.

9
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.370
And the goals of this section

10
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.410
are for you to to learn about
the declarative routing.

11
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.140
Become familiar with the GoRouter APIs

12
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.470
and show you how to
migrate an existing app

13
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.170
from navigator 1.0 to GoRouter,

14
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.260
so that you can also go
through the same process

15
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.430
with confidence in your own apps.

16
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.120
And even if you're already
familiar with GoRouter,

17
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.610
chances are that you will learn
a few tricks along the way.

18
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.260
And these lessons will
be particularly valuable

19
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.520
because we already have an
eCommerce project to start from

20
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.940
which already contains a
number of different pages.

21
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.760
And I think that this
project is not too simple

22
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.350
and not too complex either,

23
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.351
making it ideal for trying
out the various APIs

24
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:00.870
that come with a GoRouter package.

25
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.660
So we will start off by talking

26
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.250
about navigator 1.0 and its limitations.

27
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.210
And how navigator 2.0
solves these limitations.

28
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.209
And why we are better of using
GoRouter directly instead

29
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.020
of navigator 2.0.

30
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.170
And then we'll install

31
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.470
and configure GoRouter in our project.

32
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.140
And we'll learn about its features

33
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.260
including how to work
with routes and sub-routes

34
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.960
and how to trigger navigation events

35
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.900
from our widgets using go and push

36
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.510
and learn about the
GoRouterHelper extension

37
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.230
that makes routing easier.

38
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.840
And also learn about
routing with parameters

39
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080
as well as error handling
for nonexisting routes.

40
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.913
In overall,

41
00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:40.780
we'll cover all the most
important GoRouter APIs.

42
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.900
And I should mention that

43
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.840
since we are still at the of the course,

44
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.470
there is still a lot of functionality

45
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.510
that we haven't implemented
in our eCommerce app.

46
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.340
And while GoRouter offers
some advanced features

47
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.670
such as the ability to redirect
users to a different page,

48
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.970
If a certain condition is not met,

49
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.540
we are not yet in a position

50
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.140
where we can take advantage
of those features.

51
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.950
All that is to say that,
while we will explore most

52
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.230
of the GoRouter APIs in this section

53
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.090
we'll get back to some of
the advanced ones later on,

54
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.800
when we'll have all the
building blocks in place.

55
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.040
Likewise, it is still
a bit too early to talk

56
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.240
about how we can write automated tests

57
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.790
for our routing logic.

58
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.623
And again,

59
00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:21.020
this is a topic that
we will cover later on.

60
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.853
In summary.

61
00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:22.686
The primary goal

62
00:02:22.686 --> 00:02:25.080
of this section is to have
you become more confident

63
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.110
about the declarative routing in flatter

64
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.060
and teach you how to use GoRouter

65
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.903
to implement the declarative
routing in your own apps.

66
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.880
And we will see how to do all
of this in the coming lessons.

67
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.560
However, if you feel adventures

68
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.690
and want to try doing things on your own,

69
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.630
you can try converting
this starter project

70
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.480
from navigator 1.0 to GoRouter

71
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.410
by following the official documentation.

72
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.700
And this is a great way to learn.

73
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.533
All right.

74
00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.030
So, let's continue on the next lesson.
