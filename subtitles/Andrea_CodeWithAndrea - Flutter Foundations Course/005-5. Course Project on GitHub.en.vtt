1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.670
- In this, I want to share with you

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.040
the official GitHub repo for this course.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.960
So if you head over to this page,

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.910
you'll be able to find all the source code

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.610
for the eCommerce app that
you'll build in this course.

6
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.130
So if at any point you want
to grab the latest code,

7
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.770
you can clone this repo
and open it in VS Code

8
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.360
and you'll find the Flutter Client app

9
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.390
inside this folder called eCommerce app.

10
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.460
And if you take a look at the readme,

11
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.090
you'll also find this link
that will take you to this page

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.970
which is a Flutter web demo
of the completed application

13
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.740
that we will be by the end of the Flutter

14
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.150
and Firebase master class

15
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.610
which is the second course in this bundle.

16
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.810
So feel free to have a
play around with this

17
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.550
but for now, let me get back to the repo.

18
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.890
And if you scroll down, you
find a list of all the chapters

19
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.160
and lessons that I will
add as I record the course.

20
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.250
And I will also create one
commit for every single lesson

21
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.260
where we'll make some code changes.

22
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.290
In fact, as you go through the
various lessons on Teachable,

23
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.330
you'll often find this link

24
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.790
that will take you to
the corresponding commit

25
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.390
where you can find all the
code changes for that lesson.

26
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.940
So if you ever get stuck
because you missed something

27
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.490
or you made a mistake, you'll
always be able to get back

28
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.440
to a working state by following
the changes that I've made.

29
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.150
And in addition to this,
each section of the course

30
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.700
will include a downloadable
starter project

31
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.110
that contains all the latest code

32
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.880
that was added up to that point.

33
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.100
And this should come handy
if you decide to get back

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.420
to the course after some time

35
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.640
and start again from a specific section.

36
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.740
And you'll also find another code snapshot

37
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.480
at the end of each section.

38
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.240
In summary, the official GitHub
repo is a valuable resource

39
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.920
and you can access it at any point

40
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.873
by going to this URL in your browser.

41
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.380
And by the way, if you
scroll down a little bit,

42
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.530
you'll find this section about
the documentation and FAQs.

43
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.720
And if you open this link, you'll be taken

44
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.300
to the official documentation
site for this course

45
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.150
where you'll find a number of
additional guides and FAQs.

46
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.360
And chances are that if
you have some questions

47
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.800
or something doesn't work for you

48
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.230
you may find the answer
that you need over here.

49
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.180
All right, so let's continue
onto the next lesson

50
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.480
where I'll start the
starter project with you.
