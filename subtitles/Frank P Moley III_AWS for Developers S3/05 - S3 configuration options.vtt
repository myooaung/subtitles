00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] The final piece when talking

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.002
about the console is that you want

3
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.004
to take a bit of time to talk about the various

4
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.008
bucket configuration options in Amazon S3

5
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.003
that we kind of glazed over earlier.

6
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.000
This configuration can be a critical component

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.002
of how you deliver S3 across your applications.

8
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.006
So go back into the S3 console if you're not already there,

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.003
click on the bucket that we created earlier,

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.008
and take a look at the tabs across the top of the screen.

11
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.008
You'll notice we have several options here

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.001
that are available to us, and each one of them

13
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.001
has a learn more option.

14
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.008
I encourage you to read through those,

15
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.007
especially before you turn any of these options on,

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:42.005
so you can understand the implications of them.

17
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.004
The first one we're going to talk about here is versioning.

18
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.007
Now, versioning allows us to store historical instances

19
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.007
of our binary object so that we can always

20
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.006
go back in time to a previous version.

21
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:58.003
Of course, this increases your storage cost, but if you need

22
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.009
the history, having it there is very powerful.

23
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.009
The next one that we're going to talk about

24
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.001
is server access logging.

25
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:10.005
And this provides detailed access logs of a bucket.

26
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.001
This detailed logging can also provide insights

27
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.003
on how your data access patterns,

28
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:18.003
both from compliance standpoint, but also

29
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.000
from a customer standpoint, that may help you

30
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.008
provide a better solution for your customers.

31
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.008
Our next option is static website hosting.

32
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.005
Now static website hosting is just that.

33
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.007
It allows you to build a simple, static website

34
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.004
using an S3 bucket as a store.

35
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.004
Now, this isn't going to give you anything sophisticated

36
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.000
from a web perspective, but if you need

37
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.008
just a simple landing page or a couple

38
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:50.007
very simple options, this might be a great one for you.

39
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.002
The next is Object-level logging.

40
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.003
Now, object-level logging,

41
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.000
as you might imagine, is just that.

42
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This uses cloud trail, which means that

43
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.009
there's going to be some significant cost associated with it.

44
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.000
But you can log all of your access and behavior

45
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of an object from within this option.

46
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.007
The final option is default encryption.

47
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.007
There are times when you want to store your data

48
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.002
in an encrypted fashion, and actually,

49
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.006
that's more often the case than not.

50
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.002
Many times in a business environment,

51
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:25.009
you will have requirements that any data you store publicly

52
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.003
or in a public infrastructure that you don't control,

53
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:30.009
it must be encrypted.

54
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:36.002
And this gives you the ability to do that if you choose to.

55
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.000
We'll continue to scroll down here.

56
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.004
Object lock allows you to lock objects from deletion.

57
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:45.000
Say, for instance, you publish a newsletter using S3

58
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.002
and never want them deleted.

59
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:50.001
This can be a great option to save you from bad code

60
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:54.005
or even typos when dealing with objects in your S3 bucket.

61
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:57.002
Do note, however, object lock is only available

62
00:02:57.002 --> 00:02:59.009
at create time and not afterwards,

63
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:04.003
at least in the current incantation of Amazon S3.

64
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:05.009
Tags we've already talked about,

65
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.008
and these are very powerful when filtering data

66
00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:12.006
through the AWS API.

67
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:15.001
Transfer acceleration is another one of those features

68
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.000
that can cost you a little bit of money

69
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.001
but may be really powerful.

70
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.005
Transfer acceleration uses Cloudfront

71
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:26.003
behind the scenes to provide a CBN for your data.

72
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:28.001
We're not going to use that in this course,

73
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:29.007
but do know that it's there if you find

74
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:31.006
that you have data stored in the United States,

75
00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:33.008
for instance, and a whole bunch of users

76
00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:37.003
in Africa or Asia or Europe that may need access

77
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.003
to that data, you may find this is a better option

78
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:46.004
for your use cases than just simply replicating your data.

79
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:49.000
The events option allows you to get events

80
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.006
when things happen within your system.

81
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:54.009
If people upload data or do other things.

82
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.003
This can be really good if you've got an automated system

83
00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.008
that's supposed to produce a file, let's say,

84
00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:01.006
every day, you may want to set up a notification

85
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.003
to make sure that you got that file,

86
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:07.002
and if you don't, go look at what's going on.

87
00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:08.006
The final option we're going to talk about here

88
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:10.006
is this requester pays.

89
00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:12.003
This is a very interesting use case,

90
00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:15.007
in which the requester of the file pays

91
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.006
through their AWS account the download fee,

92
00:04:18.006 --> 00:04:23.001
as opposed to you paying it, the owner of this bucket.

93
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:24.008
The only time I've ever seen this used

94
00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:26.006
is with a security firm that would generate

95
00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:29.001
these massive reports, but didn't want to pay

96
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.004
for us to get access to them, so they put them

97
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.005
in a bucket, used requester pays,

98
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:35.007
and then we had to download them that way

99
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:39.009
so that we were paying the transfer costs.

100
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.006
You'll notice on the permissions tab

101
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.009
that we have all of this public access

102
00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.006
that we talked about earlier.

103
00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:49.002
We also have the ability to create access control lists,

104
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:51.002
and these can be really critical

105
00:04:51.002 --> 00:04:53.003
if you only want certain applications

106
00:04:53.003 --> 00:04:56.009
or certain systems to access your bucket.

107
00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.006
There's bucket policy that you can write

108
00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:01.004
if you want to create your own,

109
00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:03.003
and then there's also CORS configuration

110
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:06.002
if you need to modify that to download files

111
00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:09.008
from a separate system.

112
00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:13.000
The management has some really cool tools in it as well.

113
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Lifecycle is very powerful, and I've used lifecycle

114
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
to expire old objects, which is one such option.

115
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.009
You can also use lifecycle to take data that's old

116
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.009
and instead of purging it, move it

117
00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:30.005
to a cheaper storage solution for more long-term storage.

118
00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:32.003
Replication gives you the ability

119
00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:35.000
to replicate your data across regions

120
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.006
or within the same region based on the needs of your system.

121
00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:42.006
Now, analytics, metrics, and inventory provide you

122
00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:47.004
more insight into the data stored within your bucket.

123
00:05:47.004 --> 00:05:50.004
And access points provide robust network security

124
00:05:50.004 --> 00:05:52.009
within your S3 bucket.

125
00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.006
We're not going to mess with any of these at all.

126
00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:57.000
Just know that they're there, and each one of them

127
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.005
has a learn more option that you can look at

128
00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:03.000
to get a lot more information than I just presented here.
