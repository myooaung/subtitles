00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.004
- For a Java example, we will operate much like we did

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.003
with the Python example.

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.005
A series of functions to show off parts of the STK.

4
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.003
We will do so using a simple Java script.

5
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.008
This is by no means how a Java program is

6
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:17.001
usually written or structured,

7
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.008
but for this example it will serve its purpose.

8
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:24.004
So I'm going to create a new project

9
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:25.009
and I'm going to use Maven,

10
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.003
that way it will handle my dependencies.

11
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:36.006
And I'm going to name my project "javas3"

12
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:44.002
and I'm going to store it where I put all of my code.

13
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.007
Now I'm going to open up my Artifact Coordinates

14
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.008
and I'm going to put in some values here that make sense

15
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:54.002
for me, so com.frankmoley.lil.s3.

16
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.001
Leave the artifact name the way it is.

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.006
And hit "Finish."

18
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.000
So our pom file's opened up.

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.001
And we're going to add a dependency section.

20
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.005
We'll add our first dependency,

21
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:10.006
and that dependency is going to be s3

22
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:19.005
and s3 comes from software.amazon.awssdk.

23
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.002
And the version that we're going to use is the latest,

24
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.001
which is 2.10.40,

25
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.007
that's the time that we're writing this.

26
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, because the SDK will complain,

27
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
we're also going to bring in a log in library.

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.008
Bring in log4j12 from slf4j.

29
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.001
And we will bring in 1.7.30,

30
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:51.004
which is the latest available now.

31
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:55.000
Now we're going to create a build section.

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.004
And we're going to add plugins to that.

33
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:05.003
And the plugin that we are going to add

34
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:16.000
is an artifact ID of maven-compiler-plugin,

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.009
which comes from org.apache.maven.plugins.

36
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.000
We'll bring in the latest version, which is three one eight

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.003
at the time we're writing this.

38
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:31.009
And we'll apply a little configuration to it,

39
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:38.005
which is a source of 11 and a target of 11

40
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:42.003
to tell it to use jdk11.

41
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:46.007
All right, now let's open up source main java.

42
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:51.002
And we'll create a new package.

43
00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:57.005
Going to name it the same as my group name.

44
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:02.000
And to that package we will create a new class.

45
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.002
Now, I'm just going to call that class "Application".

46
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:11.002
And just a couple more things here,

47
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:16.001
we'll create a main method in here.

48
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:26.007
And we will just simply do a system.out.println

49
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:29.002
and I'm going to say "hello world".

50
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:34.004
And at that point we can run our application.

51
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:37.003
'Kay, rephrase that big pause out of there.

52
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:39.005
And you'll see it prints out "hello world".

53
00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:42.006
So we've got our application up and running, set up.

54
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:46.005
There's a couple other things that I'm going to add.

55
00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:48.006
Again, to prevent things from complaining,

56
00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:55.001
we're going to create a log4j.properties file.

57
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:59.007
And I am just going to drop in a very standard configuration,

58
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:05.008
any of them will work, which you can find on the internet.

59
00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:08.000
Or you can download them from the exercise files,

60
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.002
it'll be available.

61
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:12.001
And that's all there is to it,

62
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:15.000
so our project is now set up and ready to run.
