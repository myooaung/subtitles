00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.007
- We're now going to start our code journey,

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.002
with Amazon S3 using Python.

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.005
And set up our project on script.

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.009
Now one thing that I want to note is that the script

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.006
is the most important part.

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.003
You don't need a full blown project but I'm going to

7
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.004
do that because it helps me stay organized.

8
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.005
And I tend to do this with all of my Python development.

9
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.000
Again if you just want to do the script,

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.006
you're totally fine doing that.

11
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.009
And we'll get to the point which the script is there.

12
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.008
But for now let's create our project.

13
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.008
So I'm going to start using PyCharm.

14
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.000
And I'm going to create a new project.

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.002
The project that I'm going to create is a Pure Python project.

16
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm going to store this in the location where I keep code

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.004
on my system all the time.

18
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.007
It's in my code directory and I have one made

19
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.003
for this course.

20
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.008
So that's where I'm going to create it.

21
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.008
And I'm going to name this.

22
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.004
Pys3.

23
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:53.007
So this new project will be stored

24
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:58.002
in my local code directory, it's going to be called Pys3.

25
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.009
I'm going to open up my project interpreter.

26
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.005
I'm going to open up my base interpreter.

27
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:06.000
And I going to choose my Python 3 implementation on my machine.

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.008
I'm definitely going to use virtual environment

29
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.005
to do this work.

30
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:14.009
And I'm going to go ahead and create my project.

31
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.002
Try to compress all of that down.

32
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:21.002
Into a very quick operation of loading that.

33
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.003
There was one dialogue box that I closed,

34
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:26.006
go ahead and just completely trim showing that dialogue box.

35
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:29.002
When it was down here and it talked about adding files.

36
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:31.000
Just trim that section out.

37
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.008
But try to compress all of this.

38
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:35.003
All right so now that our project is up.

39
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.008
We're going to go ahead and open it up.

40
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:43.000
And I'm going to create a new Python file.

41
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.004
I'm going to name this file Pys3.

42
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.002
All right so let's go ahead and get our script ready.

43
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:50.000
We're going to start with a she-bang.

44
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.006
So pound, exclamation point, usr, env, Python 3.

45
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.004
So now we're going to put in a block comma here.

46
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:06.007
So pound, space, and then, dash, star, dash,

47
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:11.009
coding is utf8, dash, star, dash.

48
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.002
And now I'm going to put in a simple comment here.

49
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:21.008
A Python script for working with Amazon s3.

50
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:24.009
And I pretty much do this with everyone of my Python Scripts

51
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.008
just because I like the format that it does.

52
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.004
So we're going to do a def main function here.

53
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:34.003
Once again put a comment here that says: entry point.

54
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:35.008
I forgot my colon.

55
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:40.002
And then we're going to do if, underscore, name,

56
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:45.004
equals, equals, colon, underscore, underscore, main,

57
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:47.001
underscore, underscore.

58
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.004
So this will allow that script to execute.

59
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:51.005
And now the thing that's functioning,

60
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.008
we will simply call main.

61
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.001
I'm back up here in my main method,

62
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:01.005
I just want to do a print, hello world.

63
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:03.003
Just to keep things clean.

64
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.003
And that's all there is to setting up our Python script

65
00:03:05.003 --> 00:02:49.000
that we will use for the rest of this chapter.
