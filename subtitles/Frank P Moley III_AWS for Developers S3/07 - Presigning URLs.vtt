00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Narrator] There are many times when we need to create

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:07.004
presigned urls for downloads and uploads.

3
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.006
For this video, we're going to use the Python STK

4
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.002
to create a download link that is signed,

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.002
so that we can give public access

6
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:19.006
to our private resources as needed.

7
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:23.007
Let's go ahead and jump back into our Python file.

8
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:31.004
And we'll create a new method called generate download link.

9
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.003
We will need to know the bucket the title is in,

10
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.008
the key for the file that we want to be able to download,

11
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.002
and we need to have an expiration time

12
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.003
and we're going to use it in seconds.

13
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.008
And then of course our S3 resource.

14
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.009
We will do a try,

15
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:54.006
and we're going to get a response this time.

16
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:59.007
We're going to use our meta client.

17
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:06.007
And we will call generate presigned URL.

18
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:14.000
Then we need to pass in the method of get underscore object.

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.004
A Params dictionary.

20
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:25.000
That Params dictionary will contain a bucket,

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.009
which we will set it to our bucket.

22
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.007
And it needs a key, which we will set it to our key.

23
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:35.009
Then we also need to set our expiration.

24
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.002
So expires in...

25
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:49.008
That needs to equal our expiration in seconds.

26
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.001
And now I want to go ahead and print this response

27
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.000
because we need a way to see that download url.

28
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.001
So we'll just use print.

29
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:01.004
We'll do our standard accept.

30
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.009
And we'll tidy up our file a little bit.

31
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.007
Now let's jump down here to main.

32
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:09.008
We'll get rid of this create bucket.

33
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:12.003
And we will call generate download link.

34
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.000
We will pass in our primary bucket

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which should have three files still.

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.003
Let's do it for F3.

37
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:23.008
We'll set a 30 second expiration window,

38
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:26.007
and we'll pass in our resource.

39
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:30.002
All right, let's go ahead and run our program.

40
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:31.006
You'll see we get a download link.

41
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:35.002
I'm going to go ahead and click on that.

42
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:37.001
And a file downloaded.

43
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:41.006
And if I open that up...

44
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:44.002
You'll see that this is my lil3 file.

45
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:49.004
I created that during a challenge exercise, so...

46
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:52.000
But there it is.

47
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So that's how you generate a download link.
