00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.005
(exciting music)

2
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.004
- [Instructor] Now it's time

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.005
for our first challenge exercise.

4
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:12.003
And that's going to be scripting a series of operations.

5
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.009
You can write this as a formal script,

6
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.008
or you can just put your commands into a file,

7
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.006
copy and paste those files into the terminal.

8
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.002
I don't want to get caught up in scripting languages

9
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.004
for this course.

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.009
So here's your requirements that you're going to script.

11
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to keep this simple since after all,

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.008
this is simple storage service.

13
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.000
So what I want you to do is I want you to script

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.008
the creation of a bucket.

15
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.003
Want you create a couple files and upload those files

16
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:40.009
to that bucket.

17
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.000
I then want you to list the contents of that bucket

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.006
all within those scripted operations.

19
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.000
Give you a few minutes and we'll be back.
