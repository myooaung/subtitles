00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] We have run through a lot of code

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.004
and examples in this course

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.006
so you may be wondering what is next?

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.005
Let's start this discussion with a quick recap.

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.009
We started this course by looking at the S3 console

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.005
and running through a brief tour of it

7
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.005
and the operations within it.

8
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.001
We then leveraged the CLI

9
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.003
to interact with buckets and objects.

10
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.000
We then spent some time with the Python SDK

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.003
and investigated some of its offerings

12
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.004
for working with buckets and objects.

13
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.007
We then did the same with the Java SDK.

14
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.008
So while this course should have started your journey,

15
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.005
there's definitely more to come.

16
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.008
I encourage you to dive deeper into the SDK.

17
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.007
Many methods and options we didn't discuss,

18
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:49.008
read the docs and play with those APIs.

19
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.008
We only touched on Java and Python

20
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:55.007
but there are SDKs for many languages.

21
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.006
Take a look at those, especially if you use those languages

22
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:03.001
on a regular basis such as Go or C#.

23
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.006
And finally, just start working with S3

24
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:10.000
and build your knowledge and experiences.

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.004
I want to take a final minute to thank you for your time.

26
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.007
Teaching is really about learning for me

27
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:19.002
so me offering this course helps me learn more.

28
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.004
I also know you have dedicated a significant amount

29
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:24.009
of your time on this course

30
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.001
and I do appreciate you for that.

31
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.009
I encourage you to ask questions

32
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.005
in the Q&A section here on LinkedIn Learning.

33
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.005
I answer questions all the time on all of my courses

34
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:40.003
and actually, I really love the engagement.

35
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:44.002
I'm also available on Twitter, GitHub and Stack Overflow

36
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.003
as FP moles.

37
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.009
I encourage you to engage with me there as well.

38
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.001
I love feedback so please, leave it either here

39
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.005
in the LinkedIn Learning

40
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.008
or through these other channels.

41
00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.005
Thanks and I hope I've got you started on your journey

42
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:07.000
through AWS S3.
