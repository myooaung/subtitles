00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] So we now have a bucket,

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:06.004
so let's start working with some single-file operations.

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.007
All right, rephrase back to this point here.

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:13.000
Working with files is really as simple as creating buckets.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.009
But first of all, let's start with some files.

6
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.008
So I'm going to make a directory on my desktop,

7
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:25.003
just call it S3, and I'll navigate there.

8
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.001
Once I'm here I'm going to create these files.

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.000
Now I'm going to do them kind of in a cheating way,

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.003
I'm going to echo out some data

11
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:41.000
into a file and I'm going to call it lil1.txt,

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.006
and I'm going to do the same thing to create file two.

13
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:50.006
So now you'll see I've got two files in this directory.

14
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.002
Now the copy command, or C-P,

15
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:56.001
works very much the same way it does on Linux.

16
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.000
It will take a local file or a file from one bucket

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.001
and copy it to an S3 bucket or back into

18
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.005
your local file system depending on the order

19
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.004
in which you execute these operations.

20
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.007
It is important to note, we can go from S3 bucket

21
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.003
to S3 bucket if we need to.

22
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:16.002
So in order to do this we are going to type

23
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:24.001
AWS S3, C-P, for copy, do our lil1 file,

24
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.002
and then we need to specify the bucket

25
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.003
that we want to copy this to.

26
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.006
So I'm going to select F-P-M lil which is

27
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.009
the bucket that I created previously,

28
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.002
go ahead and execute that command,

29
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.003
you'll see that it uploads that bucket.

30
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:42.009
Let's jump into our console, select our bucket,

31
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.006
and you'll see that our file is indeed available there.

32
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.008
Let's go back to our terminal,

33
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:51.002
we're going to take a look at the move command.

34
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:52.008
So if I do an L-S on my directory

35
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.009
you'll see that I have both of my files here.

36
00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:03.006
Let's do an AWS S3 M-V for move, lil2 out to S3,

37
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:09.009
F-P-M lil, and now we've executed that move command.

38
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.008
So if I do an L-S here locally,

39
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:15.002
you'll see that that file is now gone.

40
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:19.002
If I go to the console and refresh my view,

41
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:22.008
the file is however uploaded into that location,

42
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.001
and that's really, really good because I can move them

43
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.002
if I don't need to keep them locally,

44
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:28.008
so I don't have to execute two commands

45
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:33.005
to copy it and then delete it.

46
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.001
So let's jump back over to our terminal.

47
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:40.000
And what I want you to do is now move them in reverse.

48
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.005
So this time we are going to type AWS, S3, M-V,

49
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:51.004
from S3 colon slash slash F-P-M lil slash lil2.txt.

50
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.000
So we're going to remove that remote file

51
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.003
into our local directory.

52
00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:58.009
And again, the move has occurred,

53
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.009
so if I L-S here, you'll see that both files exist,

54
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:06.002
if I jump back into the console and I refresh,

55
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.005
the file from the bucket itself is gone.

56
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.006
Again, we just moved files from one direction to the other,

57
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:14.002
and it just depends on the order

58
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:17.000
in which you put them in the command.

59
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.007
Let's jump back to the terminal one more time.

60
00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:21.009
So we've copied, we've moved files,

61
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.005
how about we just want to remove it?

62
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:26.000
We just want to get rid of it completely?

63
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.008
We can do that by doing an AWS, S3 R-M command,

64
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:37.005
type in S3 colon colon, F-P-M lil, slash lil1.txt.

65
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.008
It's going to get us an indication that it's been deleted.

66
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:42.009
Jump back in our console, refresh our view,

67
00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.002
our bucket is empty.

68
00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:46.007
Go back to our terminal real quick,

69
00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:49.007
and I want you to execute that same command.

70
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:55.002
So AWS, S3 R-M, and then our full path.

71
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:57.004
You will see it still says delete.

72
00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:58.008
It gives you no indication that

73
00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:01.006
that remote file didn't exist.

74
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:04.001
Just something to think about, it's a little caveat,

75
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.004
it doesn't show a 404, it just says,

76
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:08.002
"Hey, the file's been deleted",

77
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:10.007
it's idempotent, you delete it multiple times,

78
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:14.008
you get the same result, and regardless, the file is gone.

79
00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:18.000
Now the R-M command has some options,

80
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.006
and one of those is a recursive delete.

81
00:04:20.006 --> 00:04:23.007
I encourage you to take a look at this documentation

82
00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:25.005
out on Amazon's website.

83
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.007
The link is displayed here so that you can

84
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:30.009
take a look at how those switches work.

85
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.007
Once again I want to reiterate,

86
00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:35.003
that even though we're working with local file system

87
00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.000
and remote file system,

88
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.001
we can copy between multiple buckets.

89
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:42.007
And we'll do that at a later point in time.

90
00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:45.004
I do want to point out that you can also rename

91
00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:47.009
your files on a copy or move.

92
00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.004
We're going to do one more set of operations here.

93
00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:56.001
So we'll do an AWS, S3, C-P lil1.txt

94
00:04:56.001 --> 00:05:00.004
to S3 colon slash slash F-P-M lil,

95
00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:03.000
again, replace that bucket name as needed,

96
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.004
and this time we're going to call it lilmod1.txt.

97
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:13.005
Go ahead and hit enter, jump back into your console,

98
00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:18.009
refresh your view, and there it is with the new file name.

99
00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.003
Because just like in Linux if I copy a file,

100
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:24.000
I can always rename it.

101
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.005
For now, we'll just select this guy, and we will delete him,

102
00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:32.002
and we are good to go.

103
00:05:32.002 --> 00:05:35.000
This is really the basics of the file concepts

104
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.006
that you can do with an AWS S3,

105
00:05:37.006 --> 00:05:38.009
but again, it's just the basics,

106
00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.000
you have a lot more behavior,

107
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
so take a look at that documentation.
