00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] All right, we're coming in the home stretch

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.001
here with Java, 'cause as you've seen,

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.001
when we create buckets in code,

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.003
often time we need to clean up after ourselves.

5
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:12.004
If you haven't noticed, we've had to do some cleanup.

6
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.006
So let's go ahead and get that process done now,

7
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.008
programmatically, with the Java SDK.

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.004
Jump back into our application class,

9
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:27.003
and we will create a new void message called deletebucket.

10
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:31.008
We're going to need to have a bucket for that.

11
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.009
Put our try block in here,

12
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:36.004
and surprise, surprise.

13
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:44.004
Once again, we will use a builder to generate our request.

14
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.009
This really is a solid way to build requests.

15
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.007
This is a great pattern,

16
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:54.000
and I'm glad that Amazon did it this way.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.002
So, passing the bucket to the builder,

18
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:07.000
and then we will call deletebucket,

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and pass it in our request.

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.007
Add in our catch block,

21
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.001
and back down at our main message,

22
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:21.009
we'll get rid of the pre-signing,

23
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.006
and we can simply delete our transient bucket at this point.

24
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:29.009
So we will do an app.deletebucket,

25
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.005
and we'll pass it in our transient bucket.

26
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.005
And let's jump over to the console.

27
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:39.001
Refresh our view.

28
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.009
Our bucket is there.

29
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.007
Okay, let's go ahead and run this application.

30
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.003
And it has completed,

31
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:51.007
so let's go back to the console.

32
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:54.008
Refresh our view, and we're one bucket shorter,

33
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:58.000
and it was our transient bucket that is now gone.
