00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Now we can start working

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.008
with batches of files in a signal directory

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.008
as opposed to single files at a time.

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:08.007
So I want you to go back

5
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.006
to that s3 directory that we created

6
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.008
in the previous video.

7
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.006
And let's take a look at what's in this directory this time.

8
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.004
Go ahead and type ls or whatever the command is

9
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:23.002
for your operating system to see the files that are there.

10
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.009
The first section we're going to take a look at

11
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.000
is the list operation.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The list operation gives us an indication

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.001
of what files are in a remote bucket.

14
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:37.001
So let's type in aws s3 ls from list

15
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:41.004
into an s3://fpmlil

16
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:44.004
or in your case your bucket name.

17
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.002
You'll see that we get no data back

18
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.003
and that's what we would expect.

19
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.006
We deleted all the files after the previous video.

20
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.004
It should be empty.

21
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:52.006
If yours is not empty,

22
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:55.002
you would see those files right here.

23
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.002
I would suggest you go remove them using an rm command

24
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.001
just to make sure that this video stays intact

25
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.003
or as close to it as possible.

26
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:05.008
So this brings us to the sync operation.

27
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:08.008
A sync operation will keep a local directory in sync

28
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:12.003
with an s3 bucket and s3 directory in sync

29
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.008
with a local bucket or an s3 directory in sync

30
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.005
with another s3 directory.

31
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:22.003
So let's start by sycing your local directory to s3.

32
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:26.009
So we're going to type aws s3 sync./

33
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.007
to indicate our local directory.

34
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.004
And then we're going to go to s3://

35
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:35.004
and then the name of our bucket,

36
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.002
in my case, fpmlil,

37
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:39.006
and what you will see is it tells us

38
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.008
that we did two file uploads.

39
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.006
Now we're going to create a new file locally.

40
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.007
So once again, I'm just going to use an echo command

41
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:52.002
to a file called

42
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:58.003
lil3.txt and I'm going to execute that sync command again.

43
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:00.006
This time you'll see it only uploaded one file.

44
00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:03.004
It knows that the other two are up to date

45
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.005
from our local directory to the s3 bucket.

46
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.003
So it only needs to push one more.

47
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.005
Let's edit a file.

48
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:10.009
So let's do an edit.

49
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.002
So I'm going to open up vi on lil3

50
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.001
now that it's been synced,

51
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:22.001
and I will just simply add some more text here.

52
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:26.002
And I will save that.

53
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.000
Now I'm going to execute that sync command one more time.

54
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.005
And you'll see that it knew that that text file change

55
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:35.002
so it uploaded that new version of the text file.

56
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.009
Let's jump back to our console.

57
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.003
And we'll go ahead and refresh our bucket.

58
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:43.002
You'll see indeed we have three files located here.

59
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:44.004
I want you to go ahead and delete

60
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.006
the lil3.txt file.

61
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:51.006
So select it, choose your actions,

62
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:54.000
then onto delete, and delete it.

63
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.006
Now let's jump back to our terminal.

64
00:02:56.006 --> 00:03:01.004
So we're going to type aws s3 sync.

65
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:05.002
This time we're going to sync from the bucket

66
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:08.006
fpmlil or your bucket name.

67
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:10.009
We're going to sync to local.

68
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.003
Nothing happened,

69
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.003
but we deleted a file.

70
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:17.002
So sync requires a command line argument

71
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:18.004
in order to do deletes.

72
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.002
And this is really for safety perspective.

73
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.001
Let's execute that command again,

74
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:27.000
but do a --delete.

75
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.008
You'll see it went ahead

76
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:30.008
and removed that third text file.

77
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.009
And this is critical because if we sync

78
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.002
we don't always want to delete

79
00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:37.002
so having that option is really powerful.

80
00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:41.003
Now let's jump back into our console, refresh our view.

81
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:43.006
Indeed the file is still gone,

82
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:46.009
and back in the terminal, the file is gone.

83
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.009
This is exactly what we would expect.

84
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.005
So sync is unidirectional

85
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:53.002
meaning it doesn't keep them in sync per se,

86
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:57.000
but it makes the source look like the destination.

87
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.001
And it is also important to note that like I said,

88
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:02.005
before with single file operations,

89
00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:06.000
batch file operations can be done between buckets as well.

90
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And not just our local file system.

91
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.006
I want to give that a try.

92
00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.000
The first thing I want you to do

93
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.002
is I want you to type aws s3 mb s3://fpmlil2.

94
00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:20.000
Again, use your prefix.

95
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.003
So this is just going to create a bucket add an s3,

96
00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:25.005
that bucket has been created.

97
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:29.006
Now we're going to do an aws s3 sync

98
00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:33.009
between s3://fpmlil.

99
00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.005
So that's the one that we created before

100
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.007
that we know has two files in it.

101
00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:41.006
And we're going to sync it to fpmlil2.

102
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.005
You will see that it copied the files

103
00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:46.001
from our first bucket into our second bucket.

104
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:48.007
And if we go back to the console,

105
00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:52.006
they still exist in our first bucket,

106
00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:58.004
but if we go to our second bucket

107
00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:02.008
there also there, and that's really cool.

108
00:05:02.008 --> 00:05:05.004
We'll jump back into our first bucket

109
00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:06.009
and jump back to our terminal

110
00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.007
so that we can clean everything up.

111
00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.009
In order to clean this up,

112
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.009
I'm going to use a couple commands

113
00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.004
just to make this easy and descriptive.

114
00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:21.007
So we will type aws s3 rm s3://fpmlil2.

115
00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:25.008
So I'm going to remove everything from fpmlil2

116
00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:30.003
by doing a recursive remove.

117
00:05:30.003 --> 00:05:37.004
Now I can execute an aws s3 rb to remove the bucket

118
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:39.006
and our bucket is gone.

119
00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:41.007
And that's all it is for file operations.

120
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.000
That ls command is really powerful.

121
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
That sync can be powerful depending on your use case,

122
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.002
but I use that ls command all the time

123
00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:51.000
when dealing with s3.
