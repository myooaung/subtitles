00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] If you already have an AWS account,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.002
you can skip this video.

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to walk through how to set up a new AWS account.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.004
Now, because most of this information is sensitive,

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.006
I'm simply going to present the steps to you,

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.009
but you can definitely follow along as I speak them out.

7
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.009
The first step is going to be to navigate to aws.amazon.com.

8
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.000
From there, up in the top right,

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.002
you can select the Create an AWS account button.

10
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.002
Now that's going to walk you through a wizard.

11
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.009
The first page, you're going to enter an email,

12
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.000
and that's what you're going to use to log in,

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.004
a strong password, and you want to give your account a name,

14
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.002
and that name should be significant to you,

15
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.006
especially if you're working with multiple accounts

16
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.008
because it allows you to switch between them easier.

17
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.006
Once you've entered that in, go ahead and click continue.

18
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.001
Now into this page of the wizard,

19
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.008
you're going to enter your personal information,

20
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:55.008
your name, your address, phone number, things like that.

21
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.009
When you're done with that, you're going to move

22
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.005
to the next screen.

23
00:00:58.005 --> 00:00:59.008
Now here's the gotcha, you're going to need

24
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.006
to have a credit card at this point.

25
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.009
Now, while you can do this as a free account,

26
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.007
they are going to at least put a temporary hold

27
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.003
on your credit card to make sure

28
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.005
that you are who you say you are.

29
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.003
In addition to that, it allows them if you do run

30
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.001
a rogue process to charge you.

31
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.005
So be aware of that.

32
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:20.002
Anything that you do outside the scope of this course,

33
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.004
now the next screen you're going to actually

34
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.000
have to enter your credit card.

35
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.007
Now this can be a little bit scary,

36
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:26.006
but it's really to validate your identity.

37
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.001
If you read the notes, they're going to put

38
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.001
a temporary hold and then they'll remove it,

39
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.000
just to validate that you are who you are.

40
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.003
You can set this up as a free account,

41
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:36.008
and they give you plenty of indication

42
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.002
of things that will cost you money.

43
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.001
And you definitely can look at your billing summary

44
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.007
at any point in time to confirm that you're not

45
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.001
spending money as you're doing this training.

46
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.002
The next page after you've entered your credit card

47
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:50.004
is going to ask you to verify your identity

48
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.007
through an SMS message.

49
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:54.001
You're going to have to put in your cell phone,

50
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.001
they'll send you a text, give you a code,

51
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.007
and you'll enter that code on the screen.

52
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:00.005
Now after you've validated your account

53
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:04.000
and put in your credit card, you're going to select your tier.

54
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.003
For this course, I'm going to select the free tier,

55
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.009
because I don't really want to spend a lot of extra money

56
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.008
as I'm learning the S3 environment.

57
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.001
So go ahead and select free tier.

58
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.003
And at this point, you'll be ready

59
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:15.006
to log in to your account.

60
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.003
You're going to use that username or your email address,

61
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.005
and then that password that you created.

62
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.001
Do keep in mind that AWS constantly is updating

63
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:26.001
their console, so this wizard may change a little bit.

64
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:27.008
But since it's a wizard, it's a pretty much

65
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.004
straightforward, step by step process.

66
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.000
And with that, let's jump in.
