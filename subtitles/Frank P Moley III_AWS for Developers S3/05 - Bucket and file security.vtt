00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.007
Just like with python,

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:05.002
there are lots of bucket and file security options.

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.005
We will focus once again

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.005
on blocking public access for these buckets

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.001
as a way to show some of these features

6
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.002
within the SDK.

7
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.003
So, let's jump back into our application class,

8
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:18.001
and once again we will create a new method,

9
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.005
public void.

10
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.005
blockPublicAccess.

11
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:29.000
Start with the try block,

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we're going to use the putPublicAccessBlockRequest

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.005
and once again when we use our builder

14
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:45.002
we must send in our bucket.

15
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm going to expand this a little bit to make it easier

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.007
to do this next section.

17
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:55.005
We're then going to call

18
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:58.006
PublicAccessBlockConfiguration,

19
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:04.005
which is itself a builder,

20
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:09.000
break this up just a little bit so it's easier to read.

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.001
All right, so, we will go through

22
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.009
and we will do all of these values.

23
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.007
So blockPublicAcls.

24
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.004
will be true.

25
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.001
blockPublicPolicy.

26
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.009
will be true.

27
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.005
ignore will be true.

28
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:33.000
and restrict.

29
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.002
Will be true.

30
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:43.000
So now that we've built our request,

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the putPublicAccessBlock,

32
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.002
pass our request,

33
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:53.008
and now add in our catch block,

34
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:57.000
put that missing semicolon,

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.008
we will remove these other methods,

36
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.004
we will call app.blockPublicAccess

37
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.003
and we will do this for our transient bucket.

38
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:07.004
So, before we execute this,

39
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:10.004
let's just over to our console,

40
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:15.006
we're going to refresh the page.

41
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.005
Right, so let's take a look at our fpmlll2

42
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.001
or your equivalent, your transient bucket,

43
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.008
and you'll see right now say it says objects can be public.

44
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:29.000
So let's jump back in, run our program.

45
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.001
So now that it's done,

46
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.006
we'll go back to our console,

47
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.008
refresh our view,

48
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:37.008
and now if you'll look at the fpmlll2

49
00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.002
or your transient bucket,

50
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:40.008
you'll see that it says

51
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.004
bucket and objects not public,

52
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:45.007
which is exactly the provided, rephrase,

53
00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:47.006
which is exactly what we just provided

54
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.006
so it's good to know that that's working.

55
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.004
So you can see that that function works,

56
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:55.009
which is another benefit again of using the SDK

57
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:59.000
as we get a lot more options than just using the CLI.
