00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] As we get started with Amazon S3,

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.005
there are a few things that we need to know

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:09.000
and some setup we need to get on your machine.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.005
Since we'll be using different operating systems,

5
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.000
I will walk through the steps with Mac OS 10.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.003
However, everything can be done

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.008
on any modern operating system

8
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:20.002
and I'll point you to the appropriate

9
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.005
locations for documentation.

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.007
There's a little bit prerequisite knowledge that I expect

11
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.003
you to have coming into this course.

12
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.003
The first is some basic knowledge of a couple development

13
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.002
languages that we will use.

14
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:36.000
Python, specifically Python 3 and Java.

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.008
Now I don't need you to be experts in either language

16
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.004
but at least have some knowledge of writing code

17
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:44.005
in these languages is a requirement.

18
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.005
Secondly, I would like you to understand some fundamentals

19
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.008
of cloud native computing.

20
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:53.004
Now using Amazon S3 does not exist in a primary

21
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:57.004
cloud native environment but it is important

22
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.006
to at least grasp some of these concepts as you begin

23
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.009
leveraging cloud infrastructure.

24
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:06.007
First and foremost you will need to have Python 3 installed.

25
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.001
We will not only use it for the AWS CLI,

26
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.004
but also to write some Python against the S3 API

27
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:17.002
using the Boto 3 library, but more on that later.

28
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:21.005
I use VirtualENV with all of my Python projects.

29
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:25.001
The IDE I use has a setting to use it as well,

30
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.001
I highly recommend that you do this

31
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.003
when you write any Python.

32
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.001
It isn't a requirement for sure

33
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.007
but it will help keep your environment clean.

34
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:35.005
I won't walk through this much

35
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:39.008
but you will see me using it in the code examples.

36
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:43.003
Now installing Python is relatively simple.

37
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.004
Linux and Mac operating systems have package managers,

38
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.004
either native or third party,

39
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:52.000
that will greatly simplify the installation process.

40
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.007
For my Mac for instance, I use Homebrew

41
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:58.009
and I execute the command, brew install Python 3.

42
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.008
If you use windows, you can just use the Python installer

43
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:05.004
which is available on python.org.

44
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:08.001
Just make sure wherever you install it from,

45
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.009
you get Python 3.

46
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.001
Now for the Java development.

47
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:15.007
We will be using JDK 11 in this course.

48
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.008
We will also be using Maven 3,

49
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.006
which can be installed using package managers

50
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.005
or following the installation instructions from maven.org.

51
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.001
To install Java,

52
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.008
I will be using the JDK from Oracle.

53
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.007
Feel free to use open JDK if you would like.

54
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:35.002
Installing Java from Oracle is as simple as downloading

55
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:38.000
the installer, DMG or tarball.

56
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.009
The installer and DMG self-install.

57
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.004
The tarball requires you putting it into a location

58
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.002
on your file system.

59
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.001
In either case you'll need to set your Java

60
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:48.009
home environment variable.

61
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.002
Note however, that some installers will do this for you.

62
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:54.006
Again, the documentation out there is very clear

63
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:58.001
for each operating system on how to install Java.

64
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:00.007
Now you will need a place to write your code.

65
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:03.000
You can use a text editor if you wish,

66
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.005
and while I have written a ton of code in text editors

67
00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:08.004
especially Python,

68
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:11.000
I find that there is too much to commit to memory

69
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.003
in each language that I use professionally.

70
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:16.004
I highly recommend therefore, that you use

71
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:18.008
a full-featured IDE.

72
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.000
There are plenty of free versions of IDEs

73
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.004
that support either Java or Python, or both.

74
00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.000
I will be using two different JetBrains products

75
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.008
because for me, they offer incredible features

76
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.009
for all of my uses.

77
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.004
For Python I will be using Pycharm professional

78
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:39.001
but there's a free version of Pycharm as well.

79
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:43.001
For Java, I will be using IntelliJ ultimate edition.

80
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.004
Again, there's a free IntelliJ as well.

81
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:48.008
Now you don't need to use the tools that I do.

82
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:52.004
Just make sure that you know how to use your IDE.

83
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:56.000
I may use some shortcuts and most modern IDEs share these

84
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.007
shortcuts and context menu options,

85
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:01.003
they may just look and feel a little bit different.

86
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:03.003
So now that we've got the prerequisites,

87
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:05.000
let's get going.
