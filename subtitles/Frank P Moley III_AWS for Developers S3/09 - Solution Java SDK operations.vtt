00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:06.009
- [Instructor] So now it's time for me to show you

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.003
my solution to this exercise.

4
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.001
Much like I did with the Python example,

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.005
I used all of the functions we'd already created,

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.007
and just kind of cascaded through our algorithm.

7
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.000
So, we'll start on line 173.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.004
I create a new bucket, using that TRANSIENT_BUCKET_NAME.

9
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.004
I upload the file F2 to that bucket.

10
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.000
I then copy the file F1 from my primary bucket

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.005
to the transient bucket.

12
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.004
On line 176 I'm then going to call listFiles,

13
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.002
and store them in a keys list.

14
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.006
I'm going to put a output there to just let me know

15
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.003
that now we're printing.

16
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.002
And I'm going to call a method, print line,

17
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.003
on each one of the keys.

18
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.004
Then I'm going to call on each of the keys, print line.

19
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.009
Then on line 179 I'm going to download a file.

20
00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.002
So, some of you may have seen an issue here on line 179

21
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.007
when you were downloading the file,

22
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.004
if your download directory wasn't clean,

23
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.006
because it can't overwrite the file

24
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.007
when it does that download.

25
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:13.003
Now on 180 I generate my URL.

26
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.003
I then do a forEach on each of the keys

27
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:16.008
to make sure that I delete them,

28
00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:19.001
and then I delete the bucket.

29
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.006
So, let's go ahead and give this thing a run,

30
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:24.000
but before we do, we'll jump over to the console.

31
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.007
Refresh the view, show that there is no transient bucket.

32
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:32.008
And we will run it.

33
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.009
So we have files, we output them to the console.

34
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.004
I did not output the pre-signed URL,

35
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.008
you may have done that.

36
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:41.004
But I've already tested that that works,

37
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.001
so I wasn't too worried about that.

38
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:45.001
But we did download them.

39
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.005
We can also open up Terminal here,

40
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:51.005
and do an ls on our

41
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:53.005
s3alt.

42
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:55.006
And you'll see we've got a file there that we downloaded.

43
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:58.006
So, we uploaded them to that temporary transient directory,

44
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.002
and then downloaded it from there.

45
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.001
So we know we at least got files out there.

46
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.000
And then the final check.

47
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.006
Go back to the console, refresh.

48
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:09.000
And indeed, we still don't have the transient bucket,

49
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.008
because it was created, the work was done,

50
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:12.005
and then it was deleted.

51
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:15.000
And that's all there is to this exercise file.
