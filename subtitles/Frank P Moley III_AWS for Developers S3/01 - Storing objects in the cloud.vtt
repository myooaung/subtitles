00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Frank Moley] There is no doubt that cloud computing

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.000
is a big deal in our industry these days.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.008
From private, public, hybrid, and multi-cloud offerings,

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:12.004
it's clear that distributed computing is growing.

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.001
I have worked in all of these environments

6
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.004
and Amazon has definitely made its mark in this world.

7
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.001
Their cloud infrastructure is used globally

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.000
in both public and private sectors.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.002
Amazon S3, or Simple Storage Service,

10
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.006
is one service that has a long history

11
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.006
of reliability and usefulness.

12
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.006
It's popularity stems from the very common need

13
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:38.003
across most industries to store binary objects

14
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:42.000
that are globally available with relatively low cost,

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.001
all while offering high reliability.

16
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.002
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

17
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.002
I'm an engineering manager, developer,

18
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:52.004
architect, teacher, and, most importantly, student.

19
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:56.001
I have many years of experience with cloud native computing,

20
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.000
including a significant amount of public cloud experience

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.001
with the most popular cloud infrastructure providers,

22
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.003
including AWS.

23
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.008
In this course, I will show you the basics,

24
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:11.008
as well as some of the more advanced concepts of Amazon S3,

25
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.007
so that you too can use this powerful tool

26
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.002
that enables you to better serve

27
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:18.000
the needs of your customers.
