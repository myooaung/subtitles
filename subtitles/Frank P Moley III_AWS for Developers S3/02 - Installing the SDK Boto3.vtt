00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] We are now going to get our SDK

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.003
up and running on our machines.

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.009
Now the way that you're going to do this will vary

4
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
based on whether you're using a virtual environment or not.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.006
But basically the process is the same,

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.003
it's just a matter of a few variables.

7
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.002
So the first thing that I'm going to do

8
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.005
is I'm going to build a file into my project

9
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:20.007
in order to house all of my dependencies.

10
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:22.005
So let me build that file

11
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:27.008
and I'm going to call it requirements.txt.

12
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:31.003
In my requirements.txt, I'm going to type in boto3,

13
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:34.000
which is the Amazon SDK,

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.003
Now in PyCharm, I can actually install this automatically

15
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.003
by selecting this plug-in.

16
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.002
But I want to show you how to do it.

17
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:42.009
So I'm going to open up a terminal.

18
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.002
Now you'll notice by this terminal

19
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.005
that I'm already in a virtual environment.

20
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:50.005
If you are not, you could type in source,

21
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:51.009
the name of your virtual environment

22
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:56.007
or the folder that it's in, bin activate

23
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.000
and it will activate your virtual environment.

24
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.008
So at this point, you can now run pip install dash r

25
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:11.002
requirements.txt and it's going to go through

26
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.008
and do an installation of everything that you need

27
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:15.009
in order to run this program.

28
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.003
You'll see I had several things

29
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.005
that came from my global library

30
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.005
but at the very end here, it says that installing

31
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:26.001
collected packages boto3 was successfully installed.

32
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.007
So at this point, I have version 1.11.9

33
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.001
of Boto 3 running in my environment

34
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.000
and I'm ready to use it to start development.
