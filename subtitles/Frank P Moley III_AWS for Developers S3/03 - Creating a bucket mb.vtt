1
00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.008
We're going to start our CLA journey by making a bucket.

2
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.005
Making a bucket in S3 via the CLA

3
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.003
is actually very straightforward.

4
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.000
You'll notice I've loaded up the Console

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.001
and I've deleted every bucket that I have.

6
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.001
I encourage you to do the same.

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.004
So we're just looking at an empty list.

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.009
Go ahead and jump over to the terminal.

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.000
And the mv command is the command that we're going to use

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.007
to make a bucket, mv for make bucket.

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:29.008
The mv command

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:34.002
or make bucket is used to make a bucket in S3.

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.005
Now, you won't get a lot of the configuration options

14
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.008
like we saw on the Console.

15
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:40.006
But we can go ahead

16
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.005
and get a bucket to store binary objects.

17
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.000
To execute the command,

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.004
I want you to type aws s3 mb s3 colon slash, slash.

19
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.001
Now at this point, you're going to name your bucket.

20
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.003
So I'm going to name mine fpmlil0203O.

21
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.007
I encourage you to use a name that has a consistent prefix

22
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.000
or some other indication

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.005
so that you can guarantee uniqueness throughout this course.

24
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.001
Go ahead and hit Enter.

25
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.005
And you'll see that Make Bucket executed.

26
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.009
Let's jump back to the Console

27
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.008
and Refresh our view.

28
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.003
And there is our bucket.

29
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.003
You'll see that objects can be public

30
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:25.009
and that's okay.

31
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.005
We're not going to have this bucket live for very long.

32
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:32.005
It's just a matter of, we created the bucket using the CLA.

33
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.006
Let's jump back in the terminal.

34
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.004
And now, we're going to delete that bucket.

35
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:40.000
And Delete Bucket command is actually very similar.

36
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.003
It's rb or remove bucket.

37
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:47.007
We're going to type in the value, fpmlil0203,

38
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.006
prefixed with the s3.

39
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.000
Go ahead and hit Enter.

40
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.009
And now, you'll see it says, Remove Bucket.

41
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.001
So we're going to go back to the Console,

42
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.003
refresh our view,

43
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.003
and our bucket is gone.

44
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:04.009
Now, let's go ahead and build a bucket that we will use

45
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.008
for most of the rest of this class.

46
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.008
Go ahead and execute your Create Bucket.

47
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:14.008
I'm just going to name mine with my prefix fpmlil.

48
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.004
Just for simplicity,

49
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.004
you can choose to do whatever you want here,

50
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.007
just know that this is going to be the bucket

51
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:22.001
that we're going to use for a lot of the work

52
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.007
that we're going to do in the rest of this course.

53
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.009
Go ahead and hit Enter.

54
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.004
Let it make the bucket.

55
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:32.002
We'll jump back into the Console,

56
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:36.000
refresh our view and our bucket is there.

57
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.006
I want you to select this Bucket

58
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:42.005
and click the Edit Public Access settings.

59
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:46.007
Let's go ahead and select Block All Public Access.

60
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:53.001
Hit Save and it's going to ask you to type in confirm.

61
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:54.008
We will Confirm that,

62
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:57.004
close this slide,

63
00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:00.007
refresh our view

64
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:01.008
And now, you'll see that our bucket

65
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:04.002
and object are not public.

66
00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:07.002
And that's all there is to using the mv

67
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:11.000
and the rb commands from within the CLA.
