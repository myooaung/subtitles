00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:05.001
(bright electronic music)

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.000
- [Instructor] It's time to leverage

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.008
the work that we have done in a challenge exercise.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.001
Your challenge is to use all of the functions

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.008
that we've created within the SDK

6
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:18.001
to create a temporary bucket, upload a file

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:23.004
to that bucket, copy a file from your existing bucket,

8
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.005
get the files and print them out.

9
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.005
Then download one of your files,

10
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.004
generate a presigned URL, delete the files,

11
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.006
and then delete the bucket.

12
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:36.006
Give you a little bit of time

13
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:39.000
and we'll back with the solution.
