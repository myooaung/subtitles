00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] We're going to take a quick diversion from S3

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.007
and talk about IAM.

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.002
I'm not going to go into a lot of depth on IAM,

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.001
but I want to give you a quick rundown

5
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.000
of how it can apply to S3.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.004
To get started, let's get the ARN for our bucket.

7
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:19.000
The ARN for our bucket is actually very simple

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as it's based on the name.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.008
But to get it,

10
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.005
select your bucket

11
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:24.004
and you'll see we have

12
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.003
this copied bucket ARN.

13
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:28.005
Go ahead and copy that.

14
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.001
You could save it somewhere for later,

15
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.007
but I'm just going to leave it in my clipboard

16
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.007
because that's a safe place for right now.

17
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:36.008
Now back in our AWS Console,

18
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:41.005
select services and type in IAM.

19
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.001
In this video we're going to create a new user.

20
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:50.000
So let's go to users and add a user,

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.004
and we will name this user oio_RO user.

22
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:04.000
We're going to select programmatic access for our user,

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.003
but we are not going to select console access.

24
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:09.001
Now we're going to go into permissions.

25
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.004
We have multiple options here.

26
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:11.006
We can bring from a group,

27
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:13.002
an existing user,

28
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:14.007
or we can look at the policies

29
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.007
that already exist.

30
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.006
Let's take a look at the S3 policies,

31
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:22.002
we can filter that by typing S3.

32
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.003
Let's open up the full access.

33
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.008
You'll see in full access,

34
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:33.002
if we look at the policy summary,

35
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:34.007
the full access is just that,

36
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.005
full access to S3.

37
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.005
If you selected JSON,

38
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:42.007
it's effect will allow on S3 anything that is star.

39
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:43.006
And that's really important.

40
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:47.001
Any action on star.

41
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:48.002
So now let's take a look

42
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.008
at what read-only access looks like.

43
00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:54.003
Read-only access has list and read.

44
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:55.008
And if you specifically go into that,

45
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:59.008
it allows you to get star and list star

46
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.003
on any bucket within S3.

47
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:09.003
Again, a another important aspect.

48
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:13.003
We are however going to create our own policy.

49
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.000
So we'll go ahead and create a policy

50
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.008
and this brings up the IAM Management Console.

51
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:20.009
Now there's a couple of ways to do this

52
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.001
if you can manually enter your JSON

53
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:24.004
if you would like

54
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.007
or you can use the visual editor,

55
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:27.004
which is what we're going to do.

56
00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:31.006
So select S3 as a service.

57
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:32.008
The actions you want,

58
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:35.006
so we can get very specific.

59
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:37.001
But what we're going to do

60
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:42.005
is we're going to select get object,

61
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:50.000
list bucket, and put object.

62
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.002
So those are the permissions.

63
00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:52.000
You'll see now

64
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.007
that we have resources that we need to populate.

65
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.001
So let's do that.

66
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.000
We're going to do specific resources.

67
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.003
So the first one is on the bucket.

68
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.000
We're going to add the full ARN for our buckets

69
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.005
So just select existing text

70
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.008
and paste in what's in your clipboard.

71
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:07.007
And you'll see the pattern

72
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:12.005
is just really ARN, AWS, S3, colon, colon, colon,

73
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:14.008
and then the name of your bucket.

74
00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:17.004
So go ahead and leave that as is.

75
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:22.003
So now we've restricted this access to just this bucket.

76
00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:24.008
We are going to allow any object to access

77
00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:29.007
within that bucket.

78
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:31.003
And now let's take a look at our policy.

79
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:34.001
So let's rewrite multiple resources

80
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.007
for everything we would fully expect.

81
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:39.004
Now we need to name our policy

82
00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:41.007
We're going to name our policy

83
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:47.003
LIL read-only policy

84
00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:50.009
and then hit create.

85
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.003
Okay, so our policy has been created.

86
00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:54.007
We're going to close that tab

87
00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:57.008
and return to the previous one.

88
00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:03.002
Now we want to refresh our view

89
00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:05.002
and then we can select LIL.

90
00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:06.007
It'll filter,

91
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:10.000
select that policy, hit next,

92
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.008
put any tags on where you want to,

93
00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:16.006
review it and create a user.

94
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.007
At this point, you can download the CSV

95
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:20.000
which I would highly encourage you

96
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.007
to get in the habit of doing

97
00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:23.003
and save it safely.

98
00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:26.008
Or we can look at the individual options on that.

99
00:04:26.008 --> 00:04:29.000
We're not going to mess with any of this right now.

100
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.008
Just know that you can actually filter a user

101
00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:33.003
even within private buckets

102
00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:37.003
to only have access to certain resources within them

103
00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:38.004
and that's really the purpose

104
00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:41.000
of what I wanted to show you within IAM.
