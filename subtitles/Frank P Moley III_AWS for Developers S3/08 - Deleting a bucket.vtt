00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] When you don't need a bucket,

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.002
say because it was for temporary storage,

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.001
you need a programmatic way to delete it.

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.007
This is powerful in leveraging buckets for long running jobs

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:13.005
and cleaning up after yourself when you're done.

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.004
So let's take a look at the delete API.

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.003
Jump back into our python file here,

8
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.000
and we'll create another new method.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.007
This time calling it delete_bucket,

10
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:31.009
we'll need to send it in a bucket name and our s3 resource.

11
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.002
We will do a try on this.

12
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.009
And we will go into the s3 bucket itself

13
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:44.000
and we will call delete.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.005
And we will now except that.

15
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:54.005
And print that error out.

16
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.004
Now we will get rid of our download link.

17
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:02.004
And we will first start by calling create_bucket.

18
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:10.000
When we call create_bucket we use our transient name and s3.

19
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then we will delete our bucket,

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.009
using the TRANSIENT_BUCKET_NAME and s3.

21
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.002
There's no real good way that I can think of

22
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.000
to actually make sure that this works,

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.009
so what I'm going to do

24
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.007
is I'm going to actually run my program in debug mode.

25
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.007
So let's jump into our console,

26
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.001
make sure that there is no buckets

27
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.004
with a transient name.

28
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:36.007
And I'm going to debug using the IDE.

29
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.002
Now at this point we hit the breakpoint,

30
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.007
the bucket should be created, but not yet deleted.

31
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:45.002
So let's jump into our console, refresh.

32
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.009
You'll see we have the bucket there,

33
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.001
jump back over.

34
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.006
Play it the rest of the way out.

35
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.002
And once it's done,

36
00:01:55.002 --> 00:02:00.003
come back into S3, refresh and our bucket is now gone.

37
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.000
That's all there is to the delete flow.
