00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] Now we're going to create an object.

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:06.003
In this case, a simple file to store in our S3 bucket.

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.005
Now I don't want to give an indication that files,

4
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.008
individual text files, for instance, are the only

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.005
things that you can store.

6
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.009
You can store files and binary objects as big

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.006
or as small as you want.

8
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.009
For the purposes of this course, a simple file will be fine.

9
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.001
So what I'd like you to do is to jump in to any text editor.

10
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.005
I'm just going to use VI in my terminal.

11
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:29.005
Go and open up your text editor and create a file

12
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.000
called file1.txt

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and we're just going to put some simple data in here.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.002
We'll save that file.

15
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.008
Now we're going to go to our web browser.

16
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.000
And I've already loaded up the S3 console.

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.003
We'll select the bucket that we created

18
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.000
in the previous video.

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.008
You'll see that there's no data here.

20
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.005
What I want you to do is click the upload button.

21
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.003
Now, if you have JavaScript enabled you can drag and drop

22
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:00.005
that file onto here or, as I'm going to do,

23
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.008
click add files, you'll see that you're presented

24
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.003
with a finder window.

25
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:10.002
Navigate to the desktop and select your text files.

26
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.006
In this case, it's a 23 byte file.

27
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.001
Go ahead and click next.

28
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.000
You'll see that you have a whole bunch of options.

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.006
You can set permissions up for the file that differ

30
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:22.007
from the bucket if you would like to.

31
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.007
For the purposes of right now, we're just going to leave it

32
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:29.004
as is for the owner and the users.

33
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:31.005
Please note here in the middle section that you can

34
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.007
actually add access to a user in another account

35
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.004
if you wish to do that.

36
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.003
We don't have public permissions on so

37
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.006
we're going to hit next.

38
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.009
Now we come up with our properties.

39
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.008
Now these properties have different costs associated

40
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:50.008
with them and it's based on the storage of this file.

41
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:52.003
Read through these, you'll see that there's

42
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:56.006
intelligent tiering, there's onezone, there's glacier,

43
00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:58.003
and they kind of give you some indication

44
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.003
of when you should use each one of these.

45
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.002
We're just going to select the standard storage class

46
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.001
and go ahead and hit next.

47
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:10.008
Review everything and then click upload.

48
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.001
Now as this does this you'll see that we now have

49
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:18.000
a file listed in our bucket within the S3 console.

50
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.008
Go ahead and select that file and click download.

51
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:27.002
Now that file should download in your web browser.

52
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.005
I'm going to go ahead and open that file.

53
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:32.000
You'll see that my text editor has opened up

54
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.008
with that file and it is completely intact which is

55
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:36.006
as we would expect.

56
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.006
But it's always nice to give yourself a little bit

57
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.006
of a confidence boost to say that what you sent

58
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.008
is what you downloaded.

59
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:45.001
And this really becomes important when you're dealing

60
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.002
with automated processes, you do want to occasionally

61
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:52.003
check your uploaded files, especially during development,

62
00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.002
to make sure that what you created is indeed

63
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:56.000
what you uploaded.

64
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.009
And don't just say yeah, a file exists,

65
00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.006
you really should look at it and make sure

66
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:01.006
the content is correct.

67
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.004
That's all we need to do to upload a file.

68
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:06.008
But let's jump back into here and now we're going to go

69
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.003
and delete this file.

70
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:11.009
So you'll see when I close this cover

71
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.005
that in addition to downloading it

72
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.009
I have a whole set of actions.

73
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.008
Take a look at the actions that are available,

74
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:22.008
you can open it, you can download it, you can get it sized,

75
00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:26.003
its encryption, you can add tags, you can rename,

76
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:30.003
delete, copy, again, a whole bunch of options

77
00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.007
are available for your file.

78
00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:35.005
For right now let's just select delete,

79
00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:38.008
it's going to confirm that we do want to delete this file.

80
00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:42.000
Hit delete, and the file is gone,

81
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and now our bucket is empty.
