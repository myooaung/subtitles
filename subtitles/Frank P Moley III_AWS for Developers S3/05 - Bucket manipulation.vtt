00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Narrator] Will now go through a few

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:02.006
of the more common ways

3
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.001
of interacting with buckets themselves.

4
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:09.000
Again, this is just a snapshot of the SDK.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.008
So, back on our Python file,

6
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.005
let's create a few more methods.

7
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.000
The first one that we're going to create is to list

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the objects in our bucket.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.005
To do that we simply need to know,

10
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.005
which bucket we want to list.

11
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.000
We will do a try once again.

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.001
And this time we're going to do a response.

13
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.004
And we're going to jump into

14
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:36.004
the actual low level client instead of using the resource,

15
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:40.003
we're going to jump into this client just to show you

16
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:43.005
how this works.

17
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.002
And we will call list objects on that client

18
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.006
and we'll pass it the bucket that we want.

19
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:55.004
Now, we will create an objects list

20
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.002
and we'll unpack this response.

21
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.009
So, for content in response

22
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.004
and this is a dictionary.

23
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:08.004
So in the response, there's an element called contents,

24
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:11.007
we're going to get each element in there.

25
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:17.009
And we will simply do an object.append.

26
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.007
And from our content, which is also a dictionary,

27
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:23.007
we'll pull out to key.

28
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:28.001
This will get us all of the objects

29
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.007
in our bucket.

30
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.003
Now, I want to do a little bit of printing here just,

31
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:38.004
so, you can see what's there.

32
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.000
So bucket contains,

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.008
we'll look at the length of our objects.

34
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:50.008
And then we will return those objects

35
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.008
'cause we may need them later.

36
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:58.007
And we will accept on a client error,

37
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.007
as, ce, then we will

38
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:09.004
print the error, excellent.

39
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:13.006
So, the next operation I'll introduce you to

40
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:16.006
is the copy file.

41
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:20.002
To do this, we need a source bucket,

42
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:24.005
a destination bucket,

43
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:30.009
a source key and a destination key.

44
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:34.008
And then of course, our S3 resource.

45
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:43.004
Now, to copy we're going to build a dictionary.

46
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:47.008
And in that dictionary, we will have a bucket,

47
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:52.005
which is our source bucket.

48
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.006
And we will have a key which as you might imagine,

49
00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:59.003
is our source key.

50
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:04.009
So now with this dictionary, we will call buckets

51
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:09.009
and we going to use the destination bucket.

52
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.006
And we will do a copy on that,

53
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:17.006
we use our source and our destination key.

54
00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:20.002
So, our source dictionary and our destination key.

55
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:23.005
So to our destination bucket, we'll copy from source,

56
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.008
passing it that value.

57
00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:29.006
Now let's put our accept in.

58
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:35.002
And we will print out our error,

59
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:37.008
and that's all there is to that.

60
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:40.002
So, let's jump down into main here.

61
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:41.008
And we'll go ahead and leave our uploads,

62
00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:44.007
that way we can get that data back out there.

63
00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.003
Let's delete the other methods.

64
00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:49.001
Now we need to create a bucket

65
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:50.002
and we're going to create it using

66
00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:54.007
our transit bucket name and S3.

67
00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:59.002
And now let's copy a file from our primary bucket

68
00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:01.009
to our transient bucket.

69
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:06.002
And we'll copy F2 pass,

70
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:09.000
our S3 resource.

71
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.009
And now I'm going to do a list objects,

72
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:14.000
and I'm not going to worry about the return

73
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.003
because we're not going to use it.

74
00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:18.003
But it will print out because we told it

75
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:21.007
to how many objects are there and we expect to see one.

76
00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:27.003
Let's run our program.

77
00:04:27.003 --> 00:04:28.002
And you'll see indeed,

78
00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:30.009
ll2 which is the transit bucket we created

79
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.004
contains one file.

80
00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:34.006
And that's all we all expect.

81
00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:37.000
Let's go over to our console here.

82
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.005
We'll refresh our view.

83
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:43.009
There is an ll2 file in the transient bucket.

84
00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:50.002
Go ahead and delete that to clean everything back up.

85
00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:58.002
And we will also delete the bucket.

86
00:04:58.002 --> 00:04:59.000
And that's all there is
