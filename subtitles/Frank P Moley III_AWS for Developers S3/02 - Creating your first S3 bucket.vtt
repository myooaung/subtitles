00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] Now we're going to go through the process

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.002
of creating our first bucket.

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.000
To begin with this video, I'd like you to be logged

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in to the console and into the S3 section itself.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.008
So now that we're in the S3 console, I want you to start

6
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:14.009
by clicking Create bucket.

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.000
You will see that we get a wizard that pops up.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.002
And we'll step through some of these options as we go.

9
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.005
First thing I'd like you to do is to name your bucket.

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.004
And remember, they must be globally unique.

11
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:29.009
So I'm going to name mine fpmlil for F-P-M, my initials,

12
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.000
LinkedIn Learning, and I'm going to put 0102 as the indication

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that this is video two in the first chapter.

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.001
Now, I do recommend you use some combination of letters

15
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.003
and numbers throughout this course,

16
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.009
especially on the prefix, that way all of your buckets

17
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.000
will be guaranteed to be unique.

18
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.004
Now, you can select a region next.

19
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:54.003
And then, if you have a bucket as I do in the background,

20
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:55.006
you can copy settings.

21
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.005
But for now, we're just going to leave the default options

22
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.006
for region and we're not going to copy any settings.

23
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.005
Go ahead and click Next.

24
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:04.006
Now, you're going to see here we're presented

25
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:05.007
with some options.

26
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.004
The first one is versioning.

27
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:11.001
This allows us to store the same file in different versions

28
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.006
over and over again and still have access to all

29
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.000
of those versions.

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.001
We'll talk more about that later.

31
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.008
Server access logging is another option.

32
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.009
But now we get to tags and tags are something

33
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.002
that I'm a big proponent of, both professionally

34
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:27.006
and personally when it comes to dealing with AWS.

35
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:31.005
So let's put a tag of purpose and a value here

36
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.006
of LinkedIn Learning.

37
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.003
And I'm going to go ahead and add another tag.

38
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:40.005
And we're going to tag this one with video 01_02.

39
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.006
Again, chapter one, video two.

40
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.000
Go ahead and scroll down and take a look

41
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.005
at the other options that you could select.

42
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.000
We're not going to pick any of them, especially the ones

43
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.005
that add cost.

44
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.009
But just be aware that these exist.

45
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.000
So go ahead and hit Next.

46
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.001
And now you're presented with your permissions options.

47
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.001
Now, we're going to accept the default here of Block

48
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.009
all public access.

49
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.002
But do know that you can build buckets

50
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:07.006
that are publicly available and that have different purposes

51
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.001
throughout the course of that bucket.

52
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.007
You can read through all of these options but again

53
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:16.006
for now let's just pick Block all public access.

54
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:18.008
Go ahead and hit Next again.

55
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:20.006
And you'll see that we're presented with everything

56
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.002
that we've selected, the name, the region,

57
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:27.001
all of that information, and the tags.

58
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.000
Go ahead and hit Create bucket.

59
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.009
So as we come back to the console here, you'll see

60
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.004
the bucket that we just created and all

61
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.004
of the details about that.

62
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.007
We'll play with other buckets later but for now

63
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:42.000
that's the basics of how to do it through the console.
