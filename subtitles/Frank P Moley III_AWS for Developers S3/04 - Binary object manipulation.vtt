00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] We're going to start walking through

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.006
manipulating binary objects in Python.

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.001
It is important to note that as we get deeper in the SDK,

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.008
there are multiple ways to do functions,

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:14.000
and many more operations than we're going to even look at.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.005
I'm providing a snapshot of the SDK.

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:20.006
The documentation, however, provides a complete picture.

8
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.008
So let's jump back into our Python file,

9
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:26.009
and we're going to create a few functions here real quick.

10
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.003
The first one that we're going to create

11
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.003
is upload file.

12
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.005
This will allow us to do an upload.

13
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.006
We're going to need the bucket, the directory,

14
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:44.001
a file, our S3 resource, and then I'm going to pass in

15
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.001
an S3 path with a default value of none.

16
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.008
This way, if we ever want to,

17
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:52.008
we can change the name of the file once we do the upload.

18
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:55.001
First thing that we need to do is create a file path,

19
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.003
and that's going to be hooked to our directory,

20
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:02.001
plus a slash,

21
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.006
plus our file.

22
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.007
We need to do a remote path,

23
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.008
and that's going to be equal to the S3 path

24
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.007
that comes in from the method signature.

25
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:18.002
If, on the remote path, is none,

26
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:23.000
we're going to set the remote path equal to the file.

27
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.001
And that way, we'll just use the same name

28
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.008
if we don't provide a remote path.

29
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:31.003
Now, we're going to do a try.

30
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:35.004
And in here, we're going to call it S3 bucket operation,

31
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.004
and we'll pass it in the bucket.

32
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:41.003
And that's where it's going to get the file from.

33
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:45.005
The remote path will be the key that it will use,

34
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:51.000
and then, we will do our except logic once again.

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.003
I'm going to copy that block into my clipboard

36
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.006
so I can just use that a few more times here.

37
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:02.007
Now, we'll create a method to download a file.

38
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:04.007
We're going to need a bucket, of course.

39
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:08.005
We're going to need a directory that we want to put the file in.

40
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.004
We will need a local name for the file.

41
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:15.004
We will need the key name of the remote file,

42
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:18.001
and then our S3 resource.

43
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.007
So once again, we'll build a file path,

44
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.008
and this equals our directory,

45
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:26.005
plus a slash,

46
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:31.000
plus local name, then we're going to do a try.

47
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.009
Once again, we will do a bucket operation.

48
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.004
And we're going to call it download file.

49
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:38.008
We'll pass it to key name.

50
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.003
This is the file we want to download,

51
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:43.001
and file path, which is where we want

52
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:46.001
the system to put that file.

53
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:49.003
And then, I will paste in that except.

54
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.005
And then, we've got one more method that I want to do,

55
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.004
and that is delete some files.

56
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:58.005
Now, the SDK allows you to delete multiple files at once

57
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:02.004
in order to save yourself the effort of going through

58
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:06.001
and deleting them one by one, which is really nice.

59
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.008
But to do that, we need to build a list of objects.

60
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:14.009
So our objects list, and that will take four key in key,

61
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:18.002
so we're going to pass in keys,

62
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.005
and we're going to build a dictionary.

63
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:24.001
So we're going to pend our objects,

64
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.004
and we're going to pend it with a dictionary

65
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:30.004
that has a key of key.

66
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:34.006
And then, the value in our case will also be key.

67
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:41.002
Now, we can do our try, and we're going to do S3 bucket

68
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:45.006
dot delete objects.

69
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:49.002
And we're going to call delete parameter on that.

70
00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:52.007
We need to pass this a dictionary of its own,

71
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:56.006
and the dictionary has a key of objects.

72
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:59.001
And for the value, we will use our objects list

73
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.000
that we created.

74
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.003
And once again, I will pass in the except block.

75
00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:10.006
Now, let's jump back here into our main.

76
00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:15.006
We'll delete the create bucket from last time.

77
00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:16.009
First thing that I want to do is,

78
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.001
I want to upload some files, and we're going to upload

79
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:25.008
from our local directory, all of the files.

80
00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:29.000
I will copy that,

81
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.003
and paste it, and just modify these values.

82
00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:35.009
So now, we've uploaded the files.

83
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.002
Now, we will download a file

84
00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:44.001
from our primary bucket name,

85
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:50.000
and we're going to put it into our download directory.

86
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.006
We will do the F3 file.

87
00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:55.006
We will name it the same,

88
00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:59.000
and we'll pass our S3 resource.

89
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.001
And finally, I want to delete the files.

90
00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:07.002
And we're going to delete the files from the primary bucket.

91
00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:11.004
We will pass it a list

92
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:13.008
of F1, F2,

93
00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:17.000
F3.

94
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.003
And we will pass it the S3 resource.

95
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:22.009
So before we keep going too much,

96
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.008
let's kind of check everything out.

97
00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:26.002
So I have the bucket loaded.

98
00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:29.009
If I refresh it, you'll see that there's no files in there.

99
00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.006
If I come back up, I only have that one bucket.

100
00:05:33.006 --> 00:05:35.008
Let's jump in the terminal.

101
00:05:35.008 --> 00:05:38.008
And in the directory that we're going to get our files from,

102
00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:40.008
you'll see I've got three files.

103
00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:42.006
And if I do an LS

104
00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:47.002
along our S3 alt bucket,

105
00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:48.005
all right, so the first thing let's do,

106
00:05:48.005 --> 00:05:53.000
you'll see we have three files in our local S3 directory.

107
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And then, let's do an LS on our S3 alt directory.

108
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.008
And you'll see, we have no files there.

109
00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:01.000
So everything's good to go.

110
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.002
So if we do this correctly,

111
00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:04.001
we're going to upload three files.

112
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:06.006
We'll download one of them into the alt directory,

113
00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:10.001
and then we're going to delete everything from AWS.

114
00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:14.008
So let's run our program.

115
00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:18.008
It completed with exit code zero, which is what we want.

116
00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:21.004
We'll come back out here to S3.

117
00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:25.002
You'll see we've got our one bucket.

118
00:06:25.002 --> 00:06:29.001
And there's no files in that bucket.

119
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.006
Go back to our terminal.

120
00:06:31.006 --> 00:06:33.004
Do an LS in our local directory.

121
00:06:33.004 --> 00:06:35.009
You'll see we have three files there.

122
00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.009
But now if we do an LS on the S3, oh, we have one file,

123
00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.001
and it's our LIL3 file.

124
00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.003
So what happened was, we uploaded all three of them,

125
00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:47.001
we downloaded one, and then we deleted all three.

126
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:48.006
And that's the basics of how you work

127
00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:50.000
with files using the SDK.
