00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.002
- [Narrator] It's time to once again,

3
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:09.006
leverage the work that we have done,

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.008
in a challenge exercise.

5
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.005
Well we're going to follow the exact same script

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.006
that we did for our Python operations.

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.001
So let's review that.

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.004
We're going to have you create a temporary bucket.

9
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.009
Upload one of your files to that bucket.

10
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.001
Copy a file from an existing bucket into this new bucket.

11
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.009
Get the files that are in this new bucket

12
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.002
and print them out.

13
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:31.008
Download a file.

14
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.001
Generate a presigned URL.

15
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.002
Delete the files and then delete the bucket.

16
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.000
And if you try to delete the bucket

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.009
before you delete the files,

18
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.005
you might notice an error.

19
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.001
So always delete the files first.

20
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.000
And if you don't believe me, give it a shot.

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.001
All right, have at it and we'll be back in a few

22
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.000
and show you a solution.
