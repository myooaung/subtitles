(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.008
- [Instructor] Now that you had a chance

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.005
to work on your script,

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.006
I'm going to show you a script that I wrote

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.001
to meet the requirements for our challenge.

6
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.002
This file is available in the exercise files

7
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.001
for this chapter,

8
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.000
but what I did was I executed this shbang on bin/bash,

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.005
so I just went ahead and wrote a bash script for this.

10
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:26.008
You see there the aws s3 mb command to make a new bucket.

11
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.008
I then created a file using an echo command

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.008
that said this is from the challenge,

13
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:36.008
stored that on my desktop in an s3 bucket called lil3.txt.

14
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:38.003
I then synced those buckets,

15
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.002
so in order to copy those files, I just used sync.

16
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.002
That way I synced all the files,

17
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.002
because there was already two there,

18
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.001
and the challenge was just create a few files.

19
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.002
So I went ahead and reused it.

20
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.006
So that sync operation will sync it,

21
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.003
and then when I do an ls on the fourth command there,

22
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.003
it will show you all three files.

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:01.006
Let's go ahead and execute this now.

24
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:05.005
So I'm going to do a bash on that file.

25
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.000
So it made a bucket.

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.008
It synced those files.

27
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:12.009
It took that new file that I created and synced them,

28
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.007
and then I did an ls command,

29
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.001
and I got all three files back out.

30
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.001
So that's how I went about meeting the requirements

31
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.003
for this challenge exercise.

32
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.004
Yours may look different,

33
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:26.003
but hopefully your output looks very similar,

34
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.008
and that you've created a bucket, you've created some files.

35
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.002
Now you've copied those files up to the bucket,

36
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.003
and then you ls or listed those out

37
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:36.003
so that you can see them.

38
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:37.009
That's really the power of the cli,

39
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.000
is that you can script everything in a bash script,

40
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.008
or just type them into your terminal

41
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.001
and get the data back out.

42
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.000
Now we're going to jump into some code.
