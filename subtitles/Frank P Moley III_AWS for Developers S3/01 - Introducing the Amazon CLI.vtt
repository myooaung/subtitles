00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] One of the most powerful aspects

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:05.006
for user adoption for any cloud provider

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.006
is the command line interface, or CLI.

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.001
Amazon has a strong CLI, and if you are

5
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.007
a Linux user especially, you will see how easy it is

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:18.009
for S3 access using the CLI.

7
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.005
Now one of the first questions you may ask

8
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:25.000
is why do you want a CLI for infrastructure in the cloud?

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.004
The CLI provides a developer-friendly way

10
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:31.002
to access resources from a familiar interface.

11
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.001
You can visualize, create, edit, and destroy

12
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.001
cloud infrastructure and storage

13
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.008
from a simple command entered in your terminal.

14
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.009
It also provides a simple way to write robust scripts

15
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:46.009
using native scripting environments like bash.

16
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.008
It also provides a quick way

17
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:52.002
to inspect your data and infrastructure.

18
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.004
For instance, if you want to see all the files

19
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:57.006
in a S3 bucket, a simple command line call

20
00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:02.006
is significantly quicker than logging in to the console.

21
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.002
I also find it is very useful when writing code.

22
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:11.001
Because the CLI uses the public API for AWS,

23
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.008
I can execute a call to visualize the output

24
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:18.003
of that call so I can unpack it in code easier.

25
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:22.001
This for me is one of the most powerful aspects of the CLI,

26
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.000
because I tend to be a visual person

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.009
when it comes to writing code.

28
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.009
And diagrams and sample calls are easier for me

29
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.004
than simply reading API specs.

30
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:35.003
Now installing the CLI is pretty straightforward.

31
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:39.005
On my machine, I simply used Homebrew to install it.

32
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.006
But the first thing you need to know

33
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:44.006
is that you must have Python installed.

34
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.001
The CLI itself is written in Python

35
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.008
and you need an interpreter on your machine to run it.

36
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.003
Amazon has some very good instructions

37
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:56.001
for using pip to install the CLI,

38
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.008
so I recommend using that as a guide,

39
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:01.003
as opposed to the way that I did it.

40
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:04.004
And finally note that you want to follow the instructions

41
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:07.000
for version one of the CLI.

42
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.004
It's the most clean of the two versions,

43
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.004
because the other one is still in a beta mode.

44
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.003
One thing that you may note, specifically with S3,

45
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:20.002
is that there are two separate CLI options.

46
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:23.004
S3 itself is a very simplified access pattern

47
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:28.009
into the CLI and it's useful for simple file manipulation.

48
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:33.003
The S3 API is a much more detailed set of commands

49
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.008
for use with S3.

50
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.004
While in all honesty, it probably has more value

51
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:41.006
for a developer, we in this course are going to focus

52
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:44.008
more on the API operations in later chapters.

53
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:47.006
So they are available if you need them,

54
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.006
but for the CLI today, we're not going to use them.

55
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:53.002
For this chapter, we are simply going to use

56
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:56.000
the S3 commands only.
