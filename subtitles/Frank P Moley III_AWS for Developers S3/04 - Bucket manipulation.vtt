00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] So just like we did with Python,

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:02.008
now we're going to take a look

3
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.005
at some of those bucket-level operations that we can use,

4
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.003
that are most common to the s decay.

5
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.004
Once again, return to our application class,

6
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.001
and we're going to create a couple methods.

7
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.009
So, the first one, will return a list of string objects,

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.000
called listFiles.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.002
And we'll pass it a bucket.

10
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:26.005
Create a new ArrayList.

11
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.005
And then we'll do our try block.

12
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.009
This time we're going to use the ListObjectsRequest.

13
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.009
Once again, we'll use the builder

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.002
and we'll pass it the bucket.

15
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, we're going to do the ListObjectsResponse.

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.006
Call on s3 the listObjects command,

17
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.003
pass it the request.

18
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.002
And now on our response,

19
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.007
we're going to look at the contents,

20
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:03.000
and we'll call forEach on that.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I'm going to do a little lambda here on content.key.

22
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.005
So that should build us a list of keys.

23
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:22.002
We will copy and paste this catch block,

24
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:26.009
and we'll return our keys when we are done.

25
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.007
So now, for our next method,

26
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:34.005
which is going to be copying files,

27
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:41.006
we need to have a sourceBucket and a destinationBucket,

28
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:51.001
a sourceKey, and a destinationKey.

29
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.001
We'll start our try block.

30
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.000
Okay, so the first thing we're going to do here is

31
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.009
we're going to do a encodedUrl, URLEncoder.encode,

32
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:08.001
we're going to pass it the sourceBucket, a slash,

33
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:12.000
the sourceKey, and we'll use

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.006
the StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString.

35
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.000
So, that will give us the URL

36
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.005
that we are going to need to use.

37
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:34.004
We're then going to create a CopyObjectRequest.

38
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:39.005
And, once again, there's a builder,

39
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:45.008
and we need to populate that builder with a copySource,

40
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:50.000
which will be the encodedUrl,

41
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.008
the destinationBucket, which will be just that,

42
00:02:55.008 --> 00:03:01.004
and the destinationKey, which will be just that.

43
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:05.003
I'll break this up so it doesn't wrap so much.

44
00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:06.002
Once we've got that done,

45
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.009
we can just call the copyObject method on our s3,

46
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.005
and pass it our request.

47
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:20.003
Put our catch block in there again.

48
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:23.001
And now we jumped out into our main method.

49
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:27.004
Let's delete all of this upload business.

50
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:28.009
And let's copy files,

51
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:33.002
we'll copy the file from the primary bucket,

52
00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:36.006
to the transient bucket,

53
00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:40.004
and we'll use F3.

54
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:45.003
And then we will call listFiles,

55
00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:48.009
pass it the primary bucket name.

56
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.007
Now, there's one thing that we should do here.

57
00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:54.006
Let's jump back up into our list method.

58
00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:56.001
After we have our keys,

59
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.000
I want to put a LOGGER message in here,

60
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.001
so we're going to add info message to our LOGGER,

61
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.006
and we're going to say,

62
00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:10.000
"Number of files in bucket",

63
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.001
and we will do a keys.size,

64
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:17.001
and that way, we can get some sort of an output.

65
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.007
So, let's go ahead and run our method.

66
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:21.000
And you'll see that we have a number of files

67
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.003
in bucket is three,

68
00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:25.008
because we looked at the primary bucket,

69
00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:29.007
when we listed files, not when we copied.

70
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:31.002
So, that's why we got three in there.

71
00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:33.000
So, we copied one,

72
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.003
but we had three in there from the previous video,

73
00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.000
so that's what they're at.
