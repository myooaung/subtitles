00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Instructor] So now it's time to work

2
00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:03.003
with some individual files using

3
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.008
the Java SDK for S3.

4
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.001
I think that you'll see that once again,

5
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.005
we follow the same pattern over and over

6
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.008
that we did with the createBucket.

7
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:15.001
So let's start off here by creating some methods,

8
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.009
so public void.

9
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.008
First thing we want to do is upload a file,

10
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:26.008
so we need to send in a bucket, a localFile,

11
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.008
a localDirectory,

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.006
and a key,

13
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.004
and we'll do a try once again,

14
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:40.001
but this time we're going to use the PutObjectRequest,

15
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.004
which once again, has a builder.

16
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:48.007
To that builder, we will add our bucket,

17
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:53.007
we will add our key,

18
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:56.009
now we'll call it s3.putObject,

19
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.005
we will pass in our request.

20
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay, now we're going to use the paths from java.nio.file,

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.006
and we're going to use the get, and we're going to pass it

22
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:14.002
the local directory, and then the local file,

23
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.009
and it will assemble that directory for us.

24
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.004
Now we once again catch Exception,

25
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:26.008
and much like I did before, I'm going to copy that,

26
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:28.002
and we'll move to our next method,

27
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:31.006
and the next method that we're going to implement

28
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.007
is downloadFile

29
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.009
and it's going to run through basically the same pattern.

30
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.009
We're going to need a bucket,

31
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.004
a localFile,

32
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:48.000
a localDirectory,

33
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.009
and a key.

34
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.002
Helps if I make that capital.

35
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:57.008
Go ahead and do our try once again,

36
00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:03.006
and we're going to use the GetObjectRequest this time,

37
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:07.001
and then on s3, we'll use the getObject call,

38
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:11.009
we'll pass it through request,

39
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.007
and once again, we'll use Paths.get,

40
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:19.003
passing in the localDirectory and the localFile name

41
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:24.004
that we want to use.

42
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:27.008
And the final method that we're going to implement

43
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.003
is deleteFile.

44
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:35.001
Going to pass in a bucket and a key,

45
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.007
go to our try block once again, and this time

46
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:44.005
we're going to use the DeleteObject request.

47
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:49.004
We'll use that builder,

48
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:55.005
and we will pass it to the deleteObject method.

49
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:57.008
All right, so back down here at our main method,

50
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:00.000
make sure you still have your TRANSIENT_BUCKET,

51
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.002
otherwise run this first and then execute the delete

52
00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:09.005
that I just did here.

53
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:14.005
So we'll upload a file to our TRANSIENT_BUCKET,

54
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:19.009
we will do F1 from our directory,

55
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:24.003
and we'll continue to keep the same name.

56
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:30.009
From our TRANSIENT_BUCKET, we will download that file

57
00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:36.006
to our download directory, keeping the same name,

58
00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:44.000
and then we'll delete the file from he TRANSIENT_BUCKET.

59
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.005
So before we execute this, I want to

60
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:49.003
pop open a Terminal window.

61
00:03:49.003 --> 00:04:00.005
I'm going to do an ls -la on my directory for the downloads.

62
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:06.003
It has a file, so I'm going to go ahead and remove that,

63
00:04:06.003 --> 00:04:10.007
and now I'll run my program.

64
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:14.005
So once again, I'll pop open a Terminal window,

65
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:18.003
and I will see if the directory file is there, and it is,

66
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:20.009
so we've uploaded it, we've downloaded it,

67
00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.008
and then we deleted it, and we can prove

68
00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:25.004
that we deleted it by going back to the console,

69
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:29.004
opening that up, refreshing our view,

70
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:38.000
and indeed the file is gone.
