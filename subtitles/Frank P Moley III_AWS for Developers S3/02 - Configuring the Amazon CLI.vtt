00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] One of the features of the CLI

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.008
is that it will authenticate automatically

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:06.005
for you once you configure it.

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.009
We're going to go through a quick tutorial

5
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.007
on how to do just that.

6
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:13.000
Now the first step that you will need

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.005
is to get your programmatic access keys.

8
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:19.006
You may remember that we created some for our test user.

9
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.009
But we will need to get credentials for our user

10
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.002
so that we can configure the access.

11
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.003
Keep in mind that you can always override

12
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.009
these when you execute the command.

13
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.007
Now in the AWS Console, go to the name at the top right.

14
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:39.000
And select Security Credentials.

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.008
From within here, select Access Keys.

16
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.008
Now you may have some listed, and if you have 'em, great.

17
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:50.000
Otherwise, click Create New Access Key.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.001
Now here you've got some options.

19
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.009
You definitely would want to download your key file.

20
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.002
It's always good to keep those saved somewhere.

21
00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:00.008
For right now, I'm just going to click the Show Access Key.

22
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:02.003
And you'll see that we have an Access Key

23
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.004
and a Secret Access Key.

24
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.003
I'm going to copy the value for the Access Key ID.

25
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:09.007
And I'm going to jump over to my terminal.

26
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm going to typ awsconfigure.

27
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And it's going to walk me through a set-by-step process.

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.002
The first thing is that it's going to ask

29
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.000
for that Access Key ID.

30
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.001
And we just copied that, so I'll go ahead

31
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.009
and paste that in, and hit enter.

32
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.001
Now it wants the Secret Access Key.

33
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.001
So return back to the console, copy that value.

34
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.003
You may need to select it all manually

35
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:35.006
as opposed to double clicking.

36
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.001
Because it often has special characters.

37
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.003
Jump back to our terminal and enter that value.

38
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.001
Now I've already defined a region name.

39
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:45.006
So you'll see it's presented as us-east-1.

40
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.004
I'll go ahead and accept that.

41
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:50.004
I've also provided an output format of jsom.

42
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.009
Can also choose yaml if you prefer.

43
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.002
I'm going to leave it as jsom.

44
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.007
And that's it, AWS should now be configured.

45
00:01:58.007 --> 00:01:59.009
Want to go ahead and test this.

46
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:08.004
So I'm going to execute command aws ec2 describe-regions.

47
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.005
Since I'm getting data back it would indicate

48
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:14.001
that I've configured my AWS Console correctly.

49
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.000
That's all we need to do before we move onto the next video.
