00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] I'm going to start this with an introduction

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.005
to the S3 Console in AWS.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.002
Like you to go ahead and open up your browser

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:11.005
and navigate to AWS.Amazon.com.

5
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:15.002
Go ahead and click sign in.

6
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:23.005
You'll enter your username and then your password.

7
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.007
At this point, you're going to see the AWS landing page.

8
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:29.004
Now there's a couple ways to get to the S3 console.

9
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.001
You can search for it in the find services dialog

10
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.007
or you can use the menu at the top of the screen

11
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.007
where it says services, drop that list down,

12
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:42.002
and either search or select it from the list

13
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:45.003
and if you've actually been to S3 as I have been recently,

14
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.009
you'll see it in the recently visited services.

15
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.006
So for this course today, let's open up services,

16
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:57.001
go ahead and filter by S3 and then select it.

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.006
You'll see in the dialog that there's lots of options.

18
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.009
Now you may or may not have a bucket created.

19
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.007
In this case, I have one that's showing up

20
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.002
but if you don't, that' fine.

21
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:08.004
Everything will still work the same.

22
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:12.003
The create button that we will see no matter what

23
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:13.006
is just for that purpose.

24
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.006
It's to create a bucket.

25
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.000
All binary objects must be stored in buckets.

26
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.003
Buckets and the name of that bucket must be globally unique.

27
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.009
So you'll see a lot of unavailable options as well

28
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.003
but we'll explain those later

29
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.004
as we go throughout the course.

30
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:31.008
On the left side, you will see that there's an option

31
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.003
for batch operations.

32
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.008
Let's go ahead and select that.

33
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:39.000
You can see by reading this page that this allows you to run

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.004
a batch operation against a selected list of objects.

35
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:47.006
Now again on the left side, there's an access analyzer.

36
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.006
As we build some buckets, we may revisit this view as well

37
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.009
and I definitely encourage you to do so,

38
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.003
so that you can see how

39
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.005
the access analyzer is actually working.

40
00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.004
So let's go ahead and return to the buckets selection

41
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.002
on the left side.

42
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:02.006
I do encourage you to feel free

43
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:04.006
to play around a little bit here

44
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.008
but especially take a look at the top right

45
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.002
where it says discover the console.

46
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:10.005
That's a great opportunity for you

47
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.005
to get more in depth information

48
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:17.000
about how this console operates from Amazon directly.
