00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.490
‫In this lecture, we're finally going to talk about animations, animations can be performed with success.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.820
‫However, there are specific properties on SVG images that can't be animated.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.920
‫This limitation makes it hard to animate charts.

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.890
‫Luckily, D3 provides a solution called D3 Transition.

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.330
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to this package.

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.330
‫This package is capable of transitioning between colors, coordinates, sciences and other attributes.

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.120
‫It does this task well by default.

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.960
‫This package is bundled with the core of D three.

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.450
‫We don't have to do anything to include it.

10
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.330
‫There are a couple of advantages for allowing D3 to handle animations with the transition library.

11
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.870
‫Firstly, as I mentioned earlier, it's able to animate any property.

12
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.070
‫Secondly, it can synchronize animations.

13
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
‫We are going to be animating multiple shapes at once.

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.590
‫These three can handle this elegantly.

15
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.070
‫Thirdly, we can play multiple animations one after another.

16
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.700
‫We can shein animations instead of playing them all at once.

17
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.440
‫Too much animation can make it hard to keep track of what's happening.

18
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.540
‫We can make it easier to understand what's going on by breaking animations down into smaller groups.

19
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.370
‫We'll look at what I mean by this in a later lecture.

20
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.010
‫Lastly, animations can be interrupted for whatever reason.

21
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.990
‫We may want to stop an animation midway through D3 allows you to do that.

22
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.660
‫There are studies out there that say JavaScript animations are less performant than CSFs animations.

23
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.060
‫This is somewhat true.

24
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.990
‫However, D three is very performance, as you'll see in a moment.

25
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.620
‫We won't experience performance issues at all in this course.

26
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.190
‫D three makes it incredibly easy to animate shapes, it's only going to take one line of code.

27
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.770
‫There are three things we're going to animate the bar's labels and the access.

28
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.700
‫All three can be animated.

29
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.320
‫Let's start with the bars in the histogram function.

30
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.110
‫Scroll to the code where we're adding the bars.

31
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.320
‫D three comes with a function called transition.

32
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.060
‫We can shein on selections.

33
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.410
‫We are going to change the transition function after the joint function.

34
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.840
‫The transition function will return a new selection, the selection it returns will contain functions

35
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.480
‫for animating its properties and attributes.

36
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.120
‫In fact, let's log the selection to understand what's being returned.

37
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.940
‫We're going to assign the selection to a variable called temp.

38
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.350
‫Next, after the transition function, we're going to break the chain by logging the temp selection.

39
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.160
‫Lastly, we will comment about the functions that are left hanging.

40
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.190
‫This will break our chart, but that's fine, we are just trying to inspect the selection with the developer

41
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.180
‫tools, let's refresh the page with the console panel opened.

42
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.860
‫In the console, we will find an object called transition, the transition object is a selection object.

43
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.230
‫If we inspect the contents, we will find the usual groups and parents arrays.

44
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.380
‫These will contain the elements that are being selected.

45
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.000
‫Nothing that's new to us.

46
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.770
‫The real changes are hidden under the Proteau property.

47
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.030
‫The transition selection will contain additional methods for controlling the animation.

48
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.290
‫In addition, we have different versions of the transformation methods.

49
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.420
‫For example, we can see that the attribute method is available on this selection.

50
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.150
‫However, this version of the attribute method is different from the regular attribute method we're

51
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.260
‫used to dealing with.

52
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.070
‫The transition selection will override the original methods.

53
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.230
‫The new version of these methods will be able to animate properties.

54
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.280
‫The arguments remain the same.

55
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.200
‫The inner mechanics of each method is different.

56
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.550
‫We can see how the changes impact our drawing by allowing the transition to play.

57
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.360
‫Let's go back to the editor.

58
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.870
‫We will undo the changes we made.

59
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.370
‫The transition function will stay where it is, you may be wondering why are we changing the transition

60
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.290
‫function after the joint function?

61
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.570
‫The transition function will animate properties that are modified after the selection has been returned.

62
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.580
‫In this example, the width, height, X and Y properties will be animated because they're changed after

63
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.900
‫the transition function.

64
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.980
‫Let's say I moved the transition function after the width and height properties.

65
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.520
‫The width and height properties won't be animated anymore, only the X and Y properties will be animated

66
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.530
‫because they're changed after the transition function.

67
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.540
‫It's important to note that order does matter.

68
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.530
‫The transition function should be changed before changing specific properties.

69
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.810
‫Otherwise, the properties may not be animated.

70
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.460
‫I'm going to move this function back to its original location.

71
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:19.150
‫Before we test our code, let's add the transition function to the other selections for the labels group

72
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.770
‫selection, we will change the transition function after the join method.

73
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.310
‫Next, for the x axis, we will change the transition function before calling Bicol method.

74
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.590
‫The x axis function will let the transition function know which shapes and properties to animate.

75
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.090
‫We won't have to worry about the details after making those changes.

76
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.550
‫Let's refresh the page.

77
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.270
‫The chart is functioning fine, our data is being drawn without a problem, if we were to switch between

78
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.080
‫different metrics, the shapes are being animated, that's great.

79
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.340
‫But there's one problem.

80
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.280
‫Some of the animations look weird in the next lecture will discuss how to fix this problem.
