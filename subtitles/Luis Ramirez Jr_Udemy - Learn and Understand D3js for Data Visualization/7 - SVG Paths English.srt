00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,110
‫In this lecture, we're going to learn about the most advanced shape in SFG.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,600
‫It's the most powerful shape, but very difficult to master.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,690
‫It's complexity is due to the fact that you're dealing with commands.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,140
‫It can be difficult to determine how a shape may come out.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,850
‫Before we get started, I want to make it perfectly clear that it's not required to be a master of SFG

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,500
‫paths.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,660
‫The whole point of this section is to get an overview of SFG.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,310
‫When we get to D three, D three will take care of all the difficult parts.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,250
‫Just as long as you understand what the path element is and what it does, you will be good to go.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,850
‫All right, let's get started inside your editor.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,670
‫Open the document we've been working in this far.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,810
‫I'm going to comment about the shapes we created in the previous lecture.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,640
‫We want to reduce as much clutter as possible.

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,460
‫I want you to do the same.

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,240
‫Let's create a path, a path can be made with the path element.

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:09,140
‫The path element is regarded as the most powerful shape because it can be conformed to draw any shape,

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,260
‫we can use it to draw circles, rectangles, hexagons or any shape you can imagine.

18
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,500
‫Paths can create shapes with straight or curved edges.

19
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,740
‫Lastly, pants can have an unlimited number of sides.

20
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:29,230
‫We can use paths to draw any of the shapes we learned about in the previous lecture.

21
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,310
‫It really is powerful, but it's the most difficult one to master.

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,220
‫Let's add some color to the shape before we start drawing the shape.

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,980
‫We'll set the fill attribute to none.

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,020
‫Then we'll set the stroke attribute to hash zero zero zero.

25
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,000
‫Next, we'll set the stroke with our tribute to 10.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,060
‫We're starting with some basic attributes to get them out of the way, we already know what these attributes

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,420
‫do.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,260
‫The attribute we're going to focus on is the attribute will add this attribute at the beginning of the

29
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:08,830
‫element.

30
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,990
‫The attribute is short for data, the value for the D attribute must be a list of commands and coordinates.

31
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,760
‫What exactly does that mean?

32
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,960
‫Imagine we have a digital pen.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,260
‫This pen can be moved around to different coordinates while it's moving around.

34
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,770
‫We can instruct the pen if it's to draw a line or not.

35
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,960
‫Based on the coordinates and commands, SVG will draw the coordinates while connecting them.

36
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,920
‫Let's look at how this functions that are about 10 commands in total.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,070
‫The very first command you'll always use is the M commands.

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,480
‫The command is short for move, the M Command instructs ACG to move the pen to a specific coordinate

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,710
‫by default.

40
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,430
‫Our virtual pen always starts at the zero zero coordinate, which is the top left corner of the SVG

41
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,030
‫element.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,060
‫If we want to draw a shape somewhere else, we can use the M command to move the pen to a different

43
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,880
‫starting point.

44
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,450
‫This command will not draw anything.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,950
‫It simply moves the pen tool for you right after this command.

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,960
‫We need to provide the coordinates.

47
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:29,010
‫The format for a coordinate is the X coordinate, followed by a comma and then the Y coordinate will

48
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,950
‫set the coordinate to one hundred one hundred.

49
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:41,030
‫Afterward, I'm going to outer space, we can begin inputting the next command, the next command will

50
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,950
‫learn about is the L command.

51
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,990
‫L is short for a line.

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,680
‫This command will tell SFG to draw a line to a coordinate same format as before.

53
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,260
‫We provide a coordinate, we're going to use the coordinates, 300, 150.

54
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:06,440
‫As you can see, we're following a pattern, it's the command followed by the coordinate, we can separate

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,830
‫each pair of commands and coordinate with spaces.

56
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,230
‫We can add as many commands as we want.

57
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,540
‫Let's check out the final result.

58
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:23,690
‫Open the document with the Ilive server extension, if you're using visual studio code, a new tab will

59
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,350
‫be opened.

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,580
‫We have one single line appearing in the image.

61
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,280
‫The starting point for the line is coming from the first command.

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,060
‫We input it.

63
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,310
‫The path shape drew a line from the first command to the second command.

64
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,170
‫Nothing great so far.

65
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,020
‫I do want to highlight that these are just random coordinates.

66
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,390
‫I really don't know what the outcome will be.

67
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,830
‫It's perfectly fine if you want to input your own custom coordinates.

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,980
‫That's the basics of paths in SVG.

69
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,880
‫We've explored only two commands so far.

70
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,840
‫For the sake of simplicity, we want to explore the other commands.

71
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,870
‫We don't have to because when we get to D three, it'll take care of working with the path elements.

72
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,800
‫All you need to understand is that the path element is meant for creating complex shapes.

73
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,470
‫It uses commands and coordinates to determine how the shape is drawn anyway.

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,920
‫That does it for paths.

75
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,400
‫We've covered everything we needed to learn about SVG.

76
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,990
‫We can do a lot more with SPG, but these basics are all you need to know.

77
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,800
‫We'll cover different shapes along the way as we encounter them.

78
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,050
‫It's time to move on to D three.

79
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,390
‫I hope you're as excited as I am.

80
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,300
‫Once you're ready, I'll see you in the next section.
