‫In this lecture, we will learn how to display the data.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,610
‫The purpose of joining data is being able to manipulate an element based on the data.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,920
‫D3 allows us to change in elements properties while accessing the associated data.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,240
‫Let's explore how it's done in our scripts.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,050
‫We're outputting a static string.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,850
‫Instead of putting this string, we will output the number that is Joynes to the element.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,340
‫We can replace this string with a function.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
‫The callback function will be called for every element that is in the selection.

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,440
‫This applies to all transformation methods, every transformation method.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,110
‫It can accept a function instead of a static value.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,220
‫These three will always invoke it.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,050
‫The callback function has one parameter.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,340
‫It's the data that is joined with the current element.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,780
‫We will call this parameter D.

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,290
‫In most examples, developers will use the letter D for the parameter name, the function must return

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:00:59,930
‫to value.

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,980
‫Our original goal was to output the number, so we will return the D parameter.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:13,220
‫We can simplify this solution further with Essex instead of typing the entire function out.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,940
‫We can replace this function with an arrow function.

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,520
‫This arrow function does the same thing as the previous function for the rest of this course, we will

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,100
‫use arrow functions to make our code simpler.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,870
‫Let's refresh the page.

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,230
‫Z3 is rendering the list with the correct numbers, we've successfully outputted the numbers from our

24
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,070
‫this gives us a better understanding of our data.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,350
‫We can do so much more with our data.

26
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,890
‫We can change the color, add attributes and even add an animation.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,900
‫The possibilities are endless.
