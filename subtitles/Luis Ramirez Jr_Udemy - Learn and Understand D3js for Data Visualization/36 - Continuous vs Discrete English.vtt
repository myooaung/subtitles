00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.990
‫In this section, we are going to dive into other scales, D3 offers a variety of scales out of the

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.620
‫box.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.110
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the D3 Scale Library.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.910
‫This repository will document the various scales available.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.270
‫I want to take the time to explore the other scales available by D3.

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.770
‫It may seem like the linear scale function can cover all our needs.

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.980
‫The truth is there are other scales available that can do a better job depending on what we're trying

8
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.610
‫to draw.

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.720
‫This section will be dedicated to exploring the other scales.

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.360
‫By the end of it, you will be comfortable navigating around the documentation before we dive into scales.

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.320
‫There's one important concept we need to understand.

12
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.330
‫Let's step aside from three for a moment, I want to talk about mathematics, I know, I know math isn't

13
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.830
‫the most exciting topic.

14
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.080
‫However, these three borrows a lot of its concepts from mathematics.

15
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.390
‫There's a specific topic that D three revolves around, which is continuous and discrete data sets.

16
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.710
‫Generally speaking, data can be put into two categories.

17
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.890
‫Data can be continuous or it can be discrete.

18
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.840
‫What do these two words mean?

19
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.160
‫If you were to search online, you will find dozens of definitions.

20
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.440
‫I think the simplest definitions are the following data is considered continuous.

21
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.540
‫If it can be measured, if data can be counted, then it's discrete.

22
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.370
‫Let's dive into each one.

23
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.020
‫We will start with continuous data.

24
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.180
‫Continuous data can be measured.

25
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.320
‫We can even break down our measurements into fractions or decimals.

26
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.200
‫If you have data with fractions or decimals, it's a good sign you have a continuous data set.

27
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.650
‫For example, our weather data was continuous.

28
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.230
‫Temperature and humidity can be measured.

29
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.820
‫It's even possible for temperature to be measured to the nearest decimal value.

30
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.060
‫If the possible values are infinite or almost infinite, there's a good chance the data is continuous.

31
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.150
‫Next, let's talk about discrete data.

32
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.250
‫Discrete data can be counted.

33
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.550
‫Unlike continuous data, discrete data can't be broken down into fractions or decimals.

34
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.060
‫For example, let's say we had a data set of a number of tickets purchased for a concert.

35
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.470
‫People can't purchase half a ticket.

36
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.660
‫You either have one or you don't.

37
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.970
‫Tickets are counted, not measured.

38
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.870
‫Discrete data has a finite number of possible values.

39
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.840
‫Let's compare examples side by side.

40
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.530
‫Examples of data sets that are continuous are the following temperature, height, distance and time.

41
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.620
‫All of these examples are things we can measure.

42
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.520
‫Examples of data sets that are discrete are the following.

43
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.940
‫The number of tickets purchased at a concert, the number of books in a library, the number of employees

44
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.470
‫at a company, and the number of text messages sent in a day.

45
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.150
‫These are examples of things we can count.

46
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.620
‫Simple, right?

47
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.690
‫I want to stress how important it is to understand this concept.

48
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.690
‫There are dozens of scales available and three, it can be tough to decide which one to use before choosing

49
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.380
‫a scale.

50
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.470
‫You need to ask yourself one very important question.

51
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.080
‫Is your data continuous or discrete?

52
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.130
‫Based on your answer, you will be able to narrow down your choices.

53
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.240
‫In the next few lectures, we will begin exploring some scales.

54
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.460
‫We won't be able to explore every scale, but we will explore the most important ones.

55
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.760
‫By the end, you will be able to pick up other scales.

56
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.110
‫Not only that, there are some skills we will look at in other sections.

57
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.050
‫So don't worry, if we don't talk about a scale in this section, we will likely look at them in other

58
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.830
‫sections.
