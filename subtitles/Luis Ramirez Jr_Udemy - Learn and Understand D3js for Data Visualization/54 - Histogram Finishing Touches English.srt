00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,770
‫In this lecture, we're going to finish the histogram we've been working on before, adding some animations.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,800
‫Here's what we'll do in this lecture.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,090
‫First, we will adjust the Y coordinates and heights for the bars.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,710
‫Second, we will draw an axis to help the reader understand the chart.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,550
‫Lastly, we will add labels to the bars to help identify each bar.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,850
‫The hard part is pretty much over.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,640
‫Adding these features will be relatively easy.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,850
‫Let's get started.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,370
‫We are going to start with the Y coordinate and height of the bars at the top of the draw function.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,190
‫We are going to create an accessor for the Y axis histograms, measure the frequency with a distribution.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,840
‫It's another way of saying how many times a value appears within a group.

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,130
‫As we saw in the previous lecture, D three formatted our data by putting the objects into arrays in

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,980
‫JavaScript.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,740
‫We have a property called length representing the number of items within a group.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,180
‫We will create an accessor that are return the length of the array below the X accessor function, create

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,640
‫a variable called Y accessor.

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,120
‫Its value will be an arrow function that accepts the data.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,660
‫We will return the length property from the data.

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,280
‫Next, let's create a scale that will transform the length property into a value that we can use to

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,840
‫set the Y and Hind attributes for the bars, scroll to these scale s. We are going to create these scale

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,620
‫below the bins, create a variable called Y scale.

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,400
‫Its value will be the D 3.0 scale linear function.

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,010
‫Next, we will change the domain function with an array.

24
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,070
‫The domain will be zero and the D3 dot max function.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,330
‫We're looking for the largest group in the new data set will pass in the new data set variable with

26
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,040
‫the Y accessor function.

27
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,960
‫This function will return the group with the biggest length after setting the domain, we will chain

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,070
‫the range function.

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,340
‫The values in the array will be dimensions, container, height and zero.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,420
‫We want the bars to take up the entire height of the container, we're passing him the largest value

31
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,870
‫first because we want to reverse the values when we draw them.

32
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,690
‫Keep in mind, the y axis goes from top to bottom.

33
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,560
‫We want to read our chart from bottom to top.

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,570
‫Therefore, we'll need to reverse the values in the range to get the desired result.

35
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,480
‫The last thing will change is the nice function.

36
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,600
‫This function will round the domain values, our scale is ready.

37
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,720
‫The last thing we'll do is update the WI and Heidt attributes for the rectangles below.

38
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,120
‫We will update the Y attribute to an arrow function that accepts the data argument.

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,430
‫We will return the following why scale, why Accessor D..

40
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,510
‫We are scaling the length property of each group before we scale the value or grabbing the length property

41
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,490
‫with the Y accessor function.

42
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,870
‫Next, we will focus on the height attribute.

43
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,900
‫We will change the value to an arrow function with the data argument.

44
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,760
‫We are going to return the following dimensions, container height minus Y, scale Y, accessor D.

45
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,290
‫The bar's height is calculated by subtracting the height of the chart by the Y component of the rectangle,

46
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,570
‫the height of a rectangle is drawn by starting at its Y position and going down.

47
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,210
‫We want the rectangle to take up the charts height minus the distance between the top of the container

48
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,310
‫and its starting y coordinate.

49
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,960
‫We're going to add infill attribute to change the color of the rectangle.

50
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,590
‫That'll give us a blue color, let's refresh the browser to view the result.

51
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,630
‫Awesome, the bars are being displayed within the bounds of the container, they're evenly spaced out

52
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,540
‫and their height seem reasonable.

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,570
‫Let's start adding some details to help the reader understand how to read the chart.

54
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,080
‫We'll start with the access switch back to the editor.

55
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,700
‫We are going to write the code for the axis after drawing the rectangles, add a comment that says Draw

56
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,480
‫Axis.

57
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:47,710
‫Then we will create a variable called x axis, its value will be the three axis bottom function with

58
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,720
‫the X scale function passed in.

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:05:00,510
‫We are creating an axis for the x axis, the three axis bottom function will draw a horizontal axis

60
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,660
‫where the ticks and labels will be under the axis we are passing and the X scale function to help these

61
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,950
‫three understand the range of our data.

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,480
‫The X axis function will draw the axis.

63
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,370
‫The next step is to tell D three where to draw the axis.

64
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,920
‫We will create a group for drawing the axis to keep things organized.

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,690
‫We will create a variable called x axis group.

66
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,560
‫Its value will be the container append method.

67
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,750
‫We will append a group element.

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,950
‫Afterward, we will change the style function, we will set the transform property to retranslate why

69
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,550
‫function.

70
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,820
‫We are going to move the group to the bottom of the container, we want the axis to appear below the

71
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,420
‫bars.

72
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,030
‫We will pass in the dimensions container, height, property with the pixel measurement.

73
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,150
‫We aren't going to move the Access's exposition because the group is being drawn in the container,

74
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,030
‫which has already been moved.

75
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,350
‫Our group is ready.

76
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,100
‫Let's draw the axis.

77
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,680
‫We will call the x axis group call function with the x axis generator.

78
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,650
‫Let's refresh the page.

79
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,590
‫The axis is appearing under the bars.

80
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,960
‫It's much easier to read the chart.

81
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,250
‫The last thing we'll do in this lecture is add labels above each bar.

82
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,760
‫It's not clear as to how many values appear within each distribution.

83
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,850
‫We should add a label to help the reader understand how many values are in each bin.

84
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,700
‫Let's go back to the editor.

85
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:49,910
‫We will add the labels after drawing the rectangles, but before drawing the axis, the labels are considered

86
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,190
‫a part of the drawing.

87
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,820
‫Therefore, it should be drawn along with the rectangles.

88
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,830
‫We are going to create a group for our labels.

89
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,990
‫We will call the append method on the container.

90
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,470
‫The name of the element is called G.

91
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,810
‫We will change the last method to add a class called Bar Labels.

92
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:19,020
‫The class is defined in the stylesheet file that came with the zip file, let's check it out for a moment.

93
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:28,780
‫The bar labels class increases the font size of the label to 16 pixels, the most important property

94
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,610
‫is the text Anker property.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,600
‫It'll move text elements from their center by default.

96
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,730
‫Text is moved on its left side.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,070
‫This will cause the text to look uneven above the bar to make the text look centered.

98
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,610
‫We are setting the text Angkor property to middle.

99
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,360
‫This will make it easier to position the text above the bars.

100
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,880
‫Switch back to the script file.

101
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,280
‫We are going to start adding the labels.

102
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,200
‫After changing the class method, we will chamba select all method.

103
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,990
‫The function will be for the text elements.

104
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,480
‫This function will give us an empty selection that's perfect for making sure the entire data set gets

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,020
‫put into the enter selection, we will join the new data set variable with the selection by changing

106
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,070
‫the data function.

107
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,440
‫Next, we will start adding the data from the entire selection into the document by calling the joint

108
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,470
‫method, the name of the element will be text.

109
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,850
‫The X and Y attributes will need to be set.

110
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,850
‫We are going to set the X attribute to an arrow function with the data argument.

111
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:54,810
‫We will return the following scale D X zero plus X scale D X one, minus X scale D X divided by two.

112
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,390
‫The calculation we're using can be broken down into two sections.

113
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,700
‫Initially, the value for the X attribute will position the text on the left side of the bar.

114
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,900
‫However, we want to position the text at the center of the bar.

115
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:20,540
‫Therefore, we're adding half the size of the bar, which is calculated in the second half of the equation.

116
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,580
‫We will add the wine attribute next.

117
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,740
‫The value for the wine attribute will be an arrow function with the data argument.

118
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,220
‫The return value for this attribute will be the following why scale, why accessor D minus 10?

119
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,610
‫We are using the wide scale function to help us calculate the starting point for the bar we are subtracting,

120
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,780
‫tend to move the text above the bar.

121
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,570
‫Remember, the y axis goes from top to bottom.

122
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,940
‫A lower number will mean the shapes position will appear higher in the image.

123
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,520
‫The last thing will do is change the text function.

124
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,350
‫We will pass and the Y accessor function.

125
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,960
‫The Y accessor function will return the length of the data passed into it, as we already know, the

126
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,960
‫function will be provided with the data joynes to the element, which is the group of data it'll return.

127
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,880
‫How many items are in the array?

128
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,170
‫That's what we want.

129
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,170
‫We're finished.

130
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,600
‫Let's refresh the page.

131
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,380
‫The labels are appearing above the bars, we now know how many values are within each distribution.

132
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,440
‫That wraps it up for this lecture.

133
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,170
‫We added some finishing touches to help us read the chart in the next lecture.

134
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,180
‫We're going to refactor the code for reasons we'll discuss soon.
