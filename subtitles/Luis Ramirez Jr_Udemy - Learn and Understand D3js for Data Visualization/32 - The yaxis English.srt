1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,540
‫In this lecture, we are going to draw the y axis for our scatterplot, the y axis will measure the

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,220
‫temperature.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,950
‫The process is going to be similar to drawing the x axis.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,370
‫You have the knowledge to tackle this task.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,890
‫I want you to draw a y axis as an exercise.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,810
‫Pause the video and good luck.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,070
‫Welcome back.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,060
‫If you were able to draw the y axis, congrats, if not, that's fine, too.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,560
‫We will work on the Y axis together.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,800
‫We are going to write our code below the X axis.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,820
‫First, we need to create the function that will draw the axis on our behalf.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,520
‫We will be using the axis left function.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,730
‫This function will draw a vertical axis with the tics and labels placed on the lines left side.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,360
‫It's normal for these elements to be positioned on the left side.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,950
‫For a scatterplot, we will create a variable called y axis.

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,980
‫Its value will be added three axis left function with the Y scale function passed in.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,850
‫We need to provide the scale to let these three know how it should generate the access, the scale provides

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,320
‫information about our data set, the next step is to draw the access.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,030
‫We will create a group element by calling the append method on the container.

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,000
‫We are creating a group to organize our drawing, we don't want the shapes to be mixed with the circles,

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,560
‫placing them in a group will help with debugging and management.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,720
‫It's time to draw the axis.

23
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,740
‫We are going to change the call function with the y axis function passed in.

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:48,670
‫This will draw the axis, we are going to move the axis with the transform property like we did with

25
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,880
‫the Y axis, the axis doesn't need to be moved because it'll already be positioned to the left of the

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,360
‫chart.

27
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,010
‫The default position works for our chart.

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,300
‫There are additional things we will want to do, such as changing the font size and adding a label.

29
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,830
‫We can reuse the class in the class function.

30
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,630
‫We will add the axis class to the group.

31
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,330
‫Let's handle the labels.

32
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,780
‫Next, we are going to need the selection for the access, we should store it in a variable.

33
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,490
‫We will assign the selection to a variable called y axis group.

34
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,720
‫After creating the selection, we will append a new text element to the group.

35
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,580
‫We are going to position the label by setting the X and Y coordinates with the attribute method.

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,860
‫For the X coordinate, we will set this attribute two dimensions dot container height divided by two.

37
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:58,150
‫For the Y coordinate, we will set this attribute to dimensions, margin left plus 15.

38
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,120
‫Next, we will add the Phil attribute, we will set color to black.

39
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,120
‫Then we will change the text function for changing the text, the label will say the following temperature

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,360
‫ampersand DSG Colen F.

41
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,950
‫We are using an HTML entity in HTML, certain characters are reserved to get around this problem.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,940
‫We can draw special characters by typing in a code.

43
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,140
‫The browser will take care of converting this from code to the character we want to output.

44
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,170
‫The code we've written will output the degree symbol.

45
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,880
‫We're almost done.

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,800
‫We will change a style method.

47
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:50,050
‫We are going to rotate the label by two hundred and seventy degrees, otherwise the label may not fit

48
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,000
‫on the axis.

49
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,260
‫It seems fitting since the Y axis is vertical.

50
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,990
‫We will set the transform property to the rotate function.

51
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,180
‫The rotation will be two hundred and seventy degrees.

52
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,940
‫One last touch, we are going to censor the texts by default text is pushed on its side.

53
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,610
‫This value will make the text uncensored on the access.

54
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,930
‫We can censor the text by setting the text anchor property to middle.

55
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,670
‫We're finished.

56
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,160
‫Let's refresh the page.

57
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,090
‫We will find the axis on the page, it's working almost perfectly.

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
‫However, where's the label?

59
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,700
‫It's definitely there, but we can't see it.

60
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,210
‫To find out why, open the Elements panel and the developer tools search for the group element that

61
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,640
‫contains the code for the Y-axis.

62
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:56,440
‫Inside this group, we will find the text element for the label, you will be able to find it by looking

63
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,540
‫at the contents of the text element.

64
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,910
‫If I hover my mouse over this element, we can see its exact location on the page.

65
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,140
‫The browser is highlighting the text element outside of the image.

66
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,720
‫That can seem strange because we did everything right.

67
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,720
‫The reason we're experiencing this problem is because we've rotated the text.

68
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,890
‫This effect throws the coordinate system off.

69
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,580
‫Luckily, we can fix this problem back in the editor.

70
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,870
‫We are going to modify the attributes.

71
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,200
‫We will add a negative symbol before each value.

72
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,760
‫This will flip the position of the tax label, let's check out the chart to see what happens.

73
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,420
‫The label is appearing in the exact spot we wanted to.

74
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,820
‫However, we have another problem.

75
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,680
‫The TML entity code is not working.

76
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,510
‫Why is this the reason it's not working?

77
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,840
‫It's because we are using the text method.

78
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,050
‫Let's flip back to the editor.

79
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:05,850
‫HTML entity codes will only work if added as an HTML value, we are using the text method for inserting

80
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,480
‫the text.

81
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,590
‫However, the text method will insert the text without processing the contents for HTML.

82
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,690
‫We need to change this to the HTML method.

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,540
‫The HTML method will allow us to insert an HTML element into the selection.

84
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,700
‫It's similar to the append method, except it overturn the original selection.

85
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,530
‫It will not return a new selection of the element inserted.

86
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,070
‫In addition, we need to write out the HTML in this example.

87
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,020
‫We aren't going to insert an HTML element.

88
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,440
‫We are using this method to add an HTML entity.

89
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,190
‫Let's refresh the browser.

90
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,120
‫The entity is working like we wanted, there's one less problem, you may have noticed it already.

91
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,330
‫We'll talk about it in the next lecture.
