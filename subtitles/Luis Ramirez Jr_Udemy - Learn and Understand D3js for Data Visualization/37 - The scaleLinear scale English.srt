‫In this lecture, we are going to talk about the scale linear scale.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,690
‫It's the first scale we ever learn about.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,450
‫I want to quickly review what this scale does now that we have a better idea of what continuous and

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,860
‫discrete data is.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,270
‫The scale linear function is a scale for continuous data sets.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,980
‫The input domain for the linear scale should be continuous.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,160
‫As for the output range, it can be considered continuous to the concept of continuous and discrete

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,310
‫data sets doesn't just apply to input domains.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,440
‫A scale function will transform our data into a new data set.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,940
‫The new data set can be categorized as continuous or discrete.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,020
‫In the case of these scale linear function, the range will be continuous one more time.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,630
‫Let's look at this diagram.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,940
‫The first axis represents values between ten and 90.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,650
‫The number of ten is transformed to zero.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,450
‫When passed through the scale, the number of 90 is transformed to seven twenty.

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,810
‫For the same reason we can transform numbers in between the two values in the input domain, we can

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,390
‫even transform values outside the range of the input domain.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,070
‫Let's look at some examples in this code snippet.

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,540
‫I'm creating a scale.

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,270
‫The input domain and output range are the same values we saw in the diagram earlier.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,400
‫If the number ten is passed into the scale function, the function will return zero.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,280
‫90 is mapped to seven twenty forty seven point thirty five is mapped to three.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,870
‫Thirty six point fifteen five is mapped to negative forty five.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
‫And lastly, one hundred is maps to eight ten.

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,850
‫The possible values we can pass into the scale function are infinite.

26
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,680
‫The possible values that can be returned by the scale function are also infinite.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,630
‫Thus the input domain and output range are considered continuous.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,460
‫The scale linear function is a scale that takes in a continuous data set.

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,150
‫The data gets transformed into another continuous data set that wraps it up for the linear scale.

30
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,480
‫In the next few lectures we will look at other scales.
