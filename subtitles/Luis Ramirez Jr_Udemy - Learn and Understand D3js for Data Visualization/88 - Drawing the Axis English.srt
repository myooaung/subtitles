00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,390
‫In this lecture, we're going to draw an axis to help us read the data, the states should be drawn

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,040
‫across the x axis.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,080
‫The population should be drawn on the y axis, if you like, try adding an axis as an exercise.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,390
‫You already have the knowledge to accomplish this task.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,460
‫Pause the video and good luck.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,150
‫Welcome back.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,310
‫If you were able to draw the axes, then that's great.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,200
‫If not, that's fine, too.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,390
‫We will draw the axes together.

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:36,810
‫We'll be working at the bottom of the draw function at a comment that says the following draw axes.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,820
‫The first step is to create the functions for drawing the axes below, the comment will define a variable

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,250
‫called x axis.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,100
‫It'll be set to the D three axis bottom function.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,050
‫The axis bottom function will draw a horizontal axis with the chicks pointing downward.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,080
‫We need to pass them the X scale function so that D three understands how to draw the axis.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,010
‫Next will define a variable called y axis.

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,790
‫It'll be set to the D three axis left function.

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:24,120
‫The axis left function will draw a vertical axis with the chicks pointing left will pass in the Y scale

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,690
‫function.

20
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,280
‫The axis functions already, let's start drawing them, the shapes for the axis should be drawn in a

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,260
‫group to keep things organized.

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,050
‫Once again, we're drawing a lot of shapes.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,660
‫Grouping shapes will make it easier to search for shapes below.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,410
‫We will create a group in the container selection by calling the append function.

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,880
‫We're going to start with the x axis, the X axis should sit at the bottom of the chart, the transform

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,510
‫attribute will need to be updated so that the axis moves down.

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,400
‫We're going to change the attribute function to change the transform attribute.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,260
‫The value will be the following.

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,070
‫Translate zero dimensions, container height.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,770
‫Next, we'll change the call function to draw the axis will pass and the x axis function.

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,500
‫The y axis will be a similar process, we'll add another group and the container selection with the

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,460
‫append function.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,740
‫The y axis should sit on the left side of the chart, will change the transform attribute by changing

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,030
‫the attribute function of value for this attribute will be the following.

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,540
‫Translate dimension's margins zero.

36
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,760
‫Then we'll change the call function with the Y axis function passed in.

37
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,800
‫Let's refresh the page to view the acces.

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,160
‫Both axes are appearing, but there are two problems with the axes the x axis is displaying every state,

39
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,790
‫which is great, but we have two extra ticks sticking out.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,570
‫For the most part, this was never a problem.

41
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,760
‫However, it can confuse the reader to have chicks sticking out on the sides when there aren't states

42
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,300
‫under them.

43
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,640
‫The second problem with this chart are the labels for the Y axis.

44
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,240
‫We don't see the full name.

45
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,850
‫All we see are zeros.

46
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,080
‫If we were to inspect the labels, we'll find that it isn't a problem with the labels.

47
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,580
‫D3 is properly outputting the correct numbers.

48
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,430
‫It's just that they're too big.

49
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,510
‫One solution would be to increase the margins.

50
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,230
‫However, we're already pushing it with space and alternative solution is to format.

51
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,840
‫The labels will tackle this issue along with the excessive ticks on the x axis.

52
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,840
‫Back in the ed, we're going to modify the axis functions we created earlier for the x axis function.

53
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,090
‫We're going to change a function called TEQ size outer.

54
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,710
‫The tick outer size function allows us to configure the size of a ticks that appear on the edges of

55
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,520
‫the axis.

56
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:24,390
‫We can pass in zero to tell D. Reid not to draw extra ticks that will remove the excess checks.

57
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,190
‫Let's work on the Y axis function.

58
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,450
‫Next, we're going to change a function called Tick's.

59
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,940
‫The tics function allows us to configure how many ticks should appear on the axis.

60
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,750
‫We've already learned how this function works.

61
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,650
‫However, what we didn't go over is the second argument.

62
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:51,610
‫We can pass any second argument for formatting the checks for the first argument will pass in null.

63
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,520
‫By passing in, no doubt, we will pick the number of tickets that should appear in the axis, what

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,330
‫we're interested in configuring is the second argument in the resource section of this lecture, I provide

65
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,790
‫a link to the D3 format package.

66
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,370
‫On this page, there's a list of possible formats we can use.

67
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,720
‫We're going to format the numbers by prefixing them with the letter M, the letter M will be a shorthand

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,030
‫way of writing million.

69
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,600
‫The format we're going to be using is called s back and the editor person s as the second argument to

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,650
‫the text function.

71
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,540
‫Let's refresh the page.

72
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:45,920
‫The outer ticks on the x axis are gone, the labels on the Y axis can be properly read instead of a

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,970
‫bunch of zeros.

74
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,330
‫They have been replaced with the letter M.

75
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,700
‫This helps the reader understand that the population size of each state can be measured in the millions.

76
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,390
‫Great.

77
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,610
‫We're finished with the stacked bar chart.

78
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,210
‫In the next lecture, we'll look at ways we can improve the chart.

79
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,350
‫I'll see you there.
