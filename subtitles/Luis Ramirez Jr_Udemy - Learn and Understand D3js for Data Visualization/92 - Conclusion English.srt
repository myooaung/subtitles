1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,600
‫Congratulations, you've made it to the very end.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,900
‫Throughout this course, you learned a lot about D3.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,580
‫It's an extremely powerful library for drawing data visualizations.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,240
‫There is a lot you can do with D3 since it's unbiased towards any particular chart or graph.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,970
‫I highly encourage you to continue your studies on the official site for D3.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,480
‫There's a link in the menu for an extensive list of examples.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,750
‫The examples go over other features of D3.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,750
‫The site we're on is called Observable.

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,860
‫Observable is a company founded by the creator of D3.

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:44,730
‫The creator of D3 wanted a place for other developers to share their knowledge of data visualization.

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,960
‫Not only will you find examples of features in D3, but you'll find notebooks of other visualizations

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,280
‫with real life data.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,900
‫It's going to be your primary source of visualizations with D3.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,470
‫What's even better is that all code is open source.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,640
‫You can take snippets from the community to build your visualizations.

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,910
‫The data visualization community is pretty big, so you'll find plenty of resources and information.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,580
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a site called Kaggle.

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,940
‫Kaggle is another site for finding real world data, such as financial, health and weather data.

19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,220
‫It's a great resource for quickly finding data that you can use to practice drawing visualizations.

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,090
‫If you enjoyed this course, please rate it.

21
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,820
‫It encourages me to keep creating content.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,370
‫I hope to see you again in another course.
