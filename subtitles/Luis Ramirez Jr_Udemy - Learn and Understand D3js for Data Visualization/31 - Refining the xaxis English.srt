1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,010
‫In this lecture, we were going to make some adjustments to the x axis, there are three things we will

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:06,350
‫do.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,430
‫First, we will add a label.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,880
‫It's not clear as to what the X axis represents.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,710
‫We should tell the reader the X axis is for measuring the humidity.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,060
‫The second thing we will adjust is the font size.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,690
‫The font size for the labels is very small.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,050
‫We should make them bigger.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,590
‫Lastly, we will optimize the drawing with VSS.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:34,180
‫We will start with the label, open the app JS file, scroll to the section where we created the axis.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,130
‫We will add a label to the group.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,530
‫It makes more sense to add it to the group.

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,430
‫Since the label is part of an axis, we should store the selection.

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,290
‫We will assign the group selection to a variable called X Axis Group.

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,120
‫Next, we will add a new element to this group by calling the append method.

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,520
‫The name of the element you want to add is called text.

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:09,210
‫The text element allows us to draw text inside of an SPG image, unlike regular HTML elements, we can

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,960
‫use the coordinate system to position the text.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,680
‫It's the element I recommend.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,760
‫Whenever you want to draw text in an image, we are going to change the position of the text element.

21
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,110
‫We are drawing it inside the group.

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,970
‫Since that's the case, it'll already be positioned at the bottom.

23
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,270
‫We will want to move it to the center of the axis and move it down slightly.

24
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,650
‫First, we will change the attribute method for the X attribute.

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,850
‫The value will be dimensions, container width divided by two.

26
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:47,300
‫Next, we will chain another attribute method for the why attribute the value will be to mention stop

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,460
‫margin dot bottom minus 10.

28
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:58,160
‫The text element requires we give it a fill, the field will set the color of the text, we will chain

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,010
‫another attribute method for the fill attribute.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,750
‫Its value will be black.

31
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,060
‫The last thing we need to add is the contents of the text, we will change the text method with the

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,200
‫text humidity.

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,640
‫We're finished.

34
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,100
‫Let's refresh the page.

35
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,110
‫The label is positioned underneath the axis, it's centered perfectly.

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,270
‫This is precisely what we wanted.

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,770
‫Let's take care of the next two issues.

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,250
‫Back in the ED, we are going to change the font size of the labels.

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,770
‫This includes the labels under the Tick's.

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,360
‫They're difficult to read because the default font size is small.

41
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,920
‫We can modify the font size by adding a class to the group after the style method.

42
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,680
‫We will change a method called PLAST.

43
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,380
‫The name of the class we will add is called Access, the second argument will be true.

44
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,020
‫We are going to change the font size by modifying the excess property, we have the option of selecting

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,830
‫the text elements in the group to apply a font size change, but it's much easier to apply it through

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
‫success.

47
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,130
‫And excess properties we have on a group will be applied to the children and also gives us an opportunity

48
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,810
‫to apply additional changes to the whole group.

49
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,120
‫Let's open the style access file we have in our project.

50
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,460
‫We will add the axis selector.

51
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,920
‫Next, we will change the font size property to 18 pixels.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,780
‫This change will take care of the font size.

53
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,600
‫There was one last thing I want to adjust in the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,540
‫to a property called Shape Rendering.

55
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,070
‫The shape rendering property tells the browser how it should draw the shapes in our image.

56
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,590
‫The browser's goal is to render the page as fast as possible.

57
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,850
‫However, it doesn't want to sacrifice the quality of the image.

58
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,350
‫It'll decide how it should render an image.

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,900
‫The shape rendering property will force the browser to draw the image in a specific way.

60
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,630
‫If we scroll down, we'll find an example.

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,440
‫The image on the left has clean edges, whereas the image on the right has pixilated edges.

62
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,080
‫It's very unrefined.

63
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:28,130
‫The advantage of having an image that looks blurry is that it will render faster for the most part,

64
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,850
‫all our shapes, our balance between speed and clarity for the axis.

65
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,100
‫I like to make them look as clear and crisp as possible.

66
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,570
‫You won't see much of a performance issue when trying to make simple shapes clearer, so it would be

67
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,410
‫beneficial to make them look better back inside our styles.

68
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,000
‫We are going to set the shape, rendering property to geometric precision.

69
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,760
‫This will make the lines look nice and clear.

70
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,160
‫Let's check out the chart.

71
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,870
‫The font size is much bigger now, the axis doesn't look much different, but at least we're already

72
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,600
‫guaranteed it'll look crisp on any device.

73
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,710
‫We will leave it here in the next couple of lectures.

74
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,670
‫We will work on the y axis.
