00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,940
‫In this lecture, we're going to finish the tooltip, we've confirmed we have the correct information

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,910
‫by repositioning the tooltip circle on the line, there's another UI element we're going to need to

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,190
‫update, which is the tooltip itself.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,250
‫The tooltip will display the date and price.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,330
‫It'll be positioned above the dots.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,660
‫Let's get started.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,880
‫We will be working in the event handler function.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,450
‫We're going to make the tooltip visible by setting its display success property to block the selection

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,090
‫for the tooltip is stored under the tooltip.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,800
‫Variable will change the style function to change this excess property.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,420
‫Next, we're going to move the tooltip over the dots.

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,000
‫We're going to use the object we stored earlier to help us.

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,190
‫First, we'll set the top CSX property to the following.

14
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,510
‫Why scale?

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,640
‫Why accessor minus 20.

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,650
‫We're subtracting 20 from the value to position the tooltip above the dots.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,770
‫We don't want it to block the dot.

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,300
‫Otherwise the reader may be confused about which point they're hovering over.

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,670
‫The unit of measurement is pixels.

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,820
‫The next SEIA says property will update if the left property, which will move the tooltip across the

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,470
‫x axis, will set this property to the following X scale.

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,650
‫X, accessor X.

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,490
‫Great.

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,690
‫The last thing we need to do is update the tooltip with the information from our object below, we are

25
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,010
‫going to call the tooltip select function to select the price element.

26
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,580
‫We're going to change the entire contents of the tooltip by changing the text function, the evalu will

27
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,550
‫be the following dollar sign.

28
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,940
‫Why accessor?

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,500
‫Take special note, there are two dollar signs, symbols in this value, the first dollar signs symbol

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,710
‫will be outputted as plain text, while the second dollar signs symbol is used by JavaScript for string

31
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,590
‫interpolation.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,100
‫Let's work on the date.

33
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,100
‫Next, we are going to call the tooltip select function again.

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,740
‫This time will select the date element.

35
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,990
‫Will change the text function, the value will be the following X accessor.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,160
‫We could leave it at this, however, I think it would be a good idea to format the date to something

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,940
‫user friendly, let's create a formatter for the date above.

38
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,810
‫The selection will create a variable called date formatter.

39
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,500
‫Its value will be the three time format function.

40
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:54,140
‫Will pass in the following percent, B percent minus D, CAAMA percent Y.

41
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,350
‫We're using the same format we had last time.

42
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,320
‫The format will allow put them on full name, followed by the date.

43
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,930
‫And lastly, the year.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,880
‫Let's wrap the value we passed into the text function with the date format or function.

45
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,160
‫We're almost finished with the tooltip, we should remove the tooltip if the reader hovers away from

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,000
‫the charge, it won't require as much work.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,460
‫We change a second on function to the selection.

48
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,700
‫It's listening for the Mousley event, which will fire when the mouse leaves the selection inside the

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,830
‫event handler.

50
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,070
‫We're going to make the tooltip invisible by calling the tooltip dot dot style function.

51
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,230
‫We're going to set the opacity property to zero.

52
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,140
‫Lastly will make the tooltip invisible by calling the tooltip style function the display s.A says property

53
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,310
‫will be set to none.

54
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,670
‫We're finished.

55
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,640
‫Let's refresh the page in the browser.

56
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,240
‫We can hover our mouse over any section of the chart, the tooltip will appear with the correct information.

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,200
‫That's great.

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,670
‫We've successfully created a tool tip.

59
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,800
‫Our line chart is complete.

60
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,150
‫D3 makes it incredibly easy to implement the features we need.

61
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,950
‫As I've said before, D3 is not biased towards a specific chart.

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,880
‫It has a suite of packages and libraries to help us draw any type of chart.

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,770
‫We'll move on to the next type of chart we can draw in the next lecture.
