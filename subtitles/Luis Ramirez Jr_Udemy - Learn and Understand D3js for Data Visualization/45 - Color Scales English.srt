00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,210
‫In this lecture, we are going to learn about color scales, up until now we've been using custom colors.

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,540
‫We didn't receive assistance with colors by D3.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,090
‫If you're not that great at picking colors, you may be tempted to search for color schemes online.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,060
‫That's one viable solution.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,480
‫However, D3 comes with color schemes we can use in our charts.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:29,320
‫In this lecture's resource section, I provide a link to a package called D3 Scale Chromatic.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,930
‫This package will contain a list of color.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,490
‫Scheme is readily available.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,060
‫We don't need to do anything to include it in our project.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,030
‫It's already included with the core of D three.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,710
‫If you scroll around the page, you will find dozens of color schemes.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,700
‫The color schemes are placed into three categories which are categorical, diverging and sequential.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,370
‫Let's explore each of them.

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,710
‫The first category is called Categorical.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,240
‫Color schemes under this category vary in colors.

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,810
‫As you can see, each color scheme is vastly different from the next one.

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,620
‫These color schemes are assigned under a property name.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,060
‫Pick any of the color schemes under the categorical category.

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,520
‫I want you to copy the entire name.

20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,440
‫Next, switch over to the page with our heat maps, we will open the console of the developer tools.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,010
‫In the console, we will paste in the color scheme we copied earlier.

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,330
‫The property will return an array of colors, the number of items in the array depends on the color

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,350
‫scheme we're using.

24
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,440
‫That's about it when it comes to categorical color schemes, their properties that contain an array

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,760
‫of colors, very simple overall.

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,300
‫Let's explore the next category of color schemes back in the documentation page.

27
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,720
‫The next category is called Diverging Color Schemes.

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:06,580
‫If we look at the examples, we can see how diverging color schemes work, each scheme contains two

29
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,620
‫different colors on either end, both colors transition slowly into each other.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,490
‫Unlike categorical schemes, diverging colors have an almost unlimited number of colors accessible via

31
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,130
‫the scale.

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,010
‫There are two ways we can access a color from the scheme.

33
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,210
‫If you look above any of the schemes, D3 will provide us with two options.

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,790
‫The first option is a function called INTERPOLATE, followed by the name of the color scheme.

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,880
‫Each scheme has a function called Interpolate.

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,210
‫The interpolate function has one parameter called T, the t parameter can be a number between zero and

37
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,960
‫one zero will give you the color on the left side of the scale.

38
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,260
‫One will give you the color on the right side of the scale.

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,300
‫Everything in between will give you a color somewhere in the transition.

40
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,100
‫Let's try using one of these schemes.

41
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,430
‫I really like this one scheme that goes from red to green.

42
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,100
‫I'm going to copy the interpolate function.

43
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,530
‫Next, let's switch over to the console again.

44
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,620
‫Inside the console, we will paste in the function, we will replace the T parameter with zero.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,570
‫This function will return and RGV color code, the color code should be the color red.

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,230
‫Let's try using the function again, but with the number one.

47
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,670
‫This time will be returned and RGV color code for the color green.

48
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,590
‫Let's try using the function one more time.

49
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,260
‫We will pass in a random number between zero and one.

50
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,920
‫We will be returned to another color somewhere in the spectrum of the scale.

51
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,120
‫Fantastic.

52
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,490
‫If you were to look through the documentation, you will find numerous interpolate functions.

53
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,490
‫They all work the same there.

54
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,390
‫There's an alternative method for grabbing a color from the color scheme.

55
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,300
‫Each scheme can be found under a property called scheme, followed by the name of the color.

56
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,470
‫This property is an array of arrays that can sound confusing, but let's log the property to inspect

57
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,920
‫its contents, copy any of these scheme properties.

58
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,600
‫Then switch over to the console to log the property without the square brackets.

59
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,610
‫The council will output an array of arrays inside each array.

60
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,370
‫There are hex color codes that can be found in the color scheme.

61
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,230
‫The array will have a length of 12, but the first three items in the array are empty.

62
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,630
‫Each array in this scheme will have a set of hex color codes.

63
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,970
‫The index can be used to count how many colors are in each array.

64
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,270
‫For example, if the index is five, the array will contain five colors.

65
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,550
‫These scheme property is a quicker way to access the colors in the color scheme.

66
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,190
‫The downside is that we're limited to between three and 12 colors.

67
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:21,070
‫We can't customize the colors in the array either unless we push or delete items in the array after

68
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,790
‫retrieving it.

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,210
‫That about does it for the diverging colors.

70
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:31,330
‫Let's go back to the documentation to explore the final category of colors called sequential.

71
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,600
‫Sequential color schemes often revolve around a single or multiple colors.

72
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,940
‫If we look at the examples, we will find that sequential color schemes have an interpolate function.

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,760
‫They work the exact same way as they did for the diverging color schemes.

74
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,150
‫Some of the sequential color schemes will also have a scheme property.

75
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,000
‫These properties work the same way as these scheme properties for diverging color schemes.

76
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,150
‫Let's try applying one of these schemes to one of our heat maps under these sequential category.

77
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,570
‫Search for a sequential color scheme for the color red.

78
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,950
‫This scheme transitions from white to red.

79
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,820
‫It's very similar to the colors we were using for the heat maps, we only need three colors.

80
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,610
‫Therefore, it makes sense to use these scheme property for this scale.

81
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,060
‫Let's copy the D3 DOT schemes, red property.

82
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:37,330
‫Afterward, we will switch back to the editor in the script file, scroll to the conditional block for

83
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,680
‫the threshold scale.

84
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,060
‫We are going to replace the array in the range function with the D3 dot schemes, red property, we

85
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,230
‫need three colors.

86
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,520
‫We can get three colors by accessing the third item in the array.

87
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,440
‫This property will return an array with three colors.

88
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,110
‫Let's refresh the page to see what we get.

89
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:10,970
‫The heat map for the threshold is functioning normally, it's using the three colors from the red sequential

90
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,680
‫color scheme.

91
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,610
‫Perfect.

92
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,260
‫We're finished with discussing the color schemes.

93
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,480
‫It's completely optional to use them.

94
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,770
‫If you have a set of colors you'd like to use, then by all means use them.

95
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,990
‫The scale chromatic package was introduced for those who aren't great with picking colors.

96
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,930
‫They're a quick and easy way to access the color scheme.
