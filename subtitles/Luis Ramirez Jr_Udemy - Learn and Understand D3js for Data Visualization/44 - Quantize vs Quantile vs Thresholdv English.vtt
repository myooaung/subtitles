‫In this lecture, we are going to discuss the three skills we learned about in the previous lectures

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.810
‫there, the quantize quintile and threshold scales, if we look at our drawings, each chart is telling

3
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.680
‫a different story.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.560
‫The data is the same throughout all charts.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.140
‫The difference between them are the scales.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.740
‫The quantize scale tells us that there's a massive disparity between social classes.

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.270
‫There are more individuals in the lower class than the middle and upper classes combined.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.620
‫The quintile scale tells us that there's an even amount of individuals in each class.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.480
‫Lastly, the threshold scale tells a similar story to the quanti scale, except less dramatic.

10
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.640
‫Out of the three scales, the threshold scale tells the story most accurately.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.170
‫These thresholds are based on research rather than letting D3 calculate the threshold.

12
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.550
‫Keep in mind, the thresholds for this scale are being set manually.

13
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.900
‫The outcome of the heat map may come out differently based on the data.

14
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.550
‫For example, if we had a list of the top 100 wealthiest individuals in the country, the heat map will

15
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.750
‫be entirely red.

16
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.490
‫Let's check out the thresholds generated by each scale.

17
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.890
‫We know how they're generated, but we may want to look at the thresholds generated by the quantize

18
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.330
‫and quintile scales.

19
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.890
‫Switch over to the ED, scroll down to the chain of conditional blocks.

20
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.270
‫We lowly quanti scale, we are going to add a console statement.

21
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.880
‫The log will say quanties, in addition, we will call the color scale Threshold's function.

22
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.920
‫The thresholds function will return an array of thresholds calculated by three, we will check out this

23
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.880
‫value in a moment.

24
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.140
‫First, let's work on logging these thresholds from the quanti scale below the Quantrill's scale.

25
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.400
‫We will call the log function again.

26
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.570
‫The long will output the word quintile, it will also output the value returned by the color scale quintiles

27
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.110
‫function.

28
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.240
‫The Quantrill's function will output these thresholds created by the quantum scale.

29
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.260
‫We aren't going too long the threshold for the threshold scale, since we already know the thresholds

30
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.170
‫there, the values we pass into the domain function, let's refresh the page and the browser with the

31
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.370
‫console opened.

32
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.760
‫In the console, we will find two logs if we peek inside each array.

33
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.780
‫There are two items in each array.

34
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.910
‫The number of thresholds will always be lower than the number of buckets.

35
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.830
‫In the end, all three scales work the same.

36
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.530
‫They transform continuous data into discrete data.

37
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.910
‫The transformation is based on the threshold set by each scale.

38
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.460
‫The main difference between all three scales is how thresholds are set.

39
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.950
‫Other than that, everything is the same.

40
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.250
‫One scale isn't better than another.

41
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.660
‫The scale you use will be based on your charts needs.

42
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.100
‫In our case, we need to set custom thresholds.

43
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.480
‫The threshold scale works best for this situation.

44
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.300
‫There's one last point I want to make about these scales.

45
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.770
‫Switch back to the ED.

46
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.190
‫One thing you may have noticed is the order of each color in the array, in each scale, the order of

47
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.310
‫colors are the same.

48
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.570
‫White is always first, followed by pink and red.

49
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.220
‫The order does matter.

50
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.890
‫If we were to swap colors around, our data may be distributed differently.

51
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.780
‫For example, if pink was the first color, the lower class will be assigned the color pink.

52
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.040
‫Keep that in mind.

53
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.090
‫Whenever working with these scales, we're finished discussing the quantize quintile and threshold scales.

54
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.990
‫Hopefully you understand their differences and similarities.

55
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.760
‫They each have their own use.

56
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.810
‫In the next few lectures, we'll continue exploring more scale's.
