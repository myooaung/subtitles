00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,850
‫In this lecture, we are going to make one final adjustment to the scatterplot before we consider it

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,100
‫complete, let's look at the X-axis for a moment.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,250
‫There are two problems with that, in my opinion.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,880
‫I think there are too many ticks and labels.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,340
‫It feels overwhelming.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,960
‫I think we would benefit from drawing less ticks and labels.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,210
‫The second problem is the labels for the checks.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,680
‫If you were to view the weather in most weather apps, the humidity is displayed as a percentage.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,050
‫The dataset stores the humidity as a number between zero and one.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,640
‫We are currently seeing decimal values.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,570
‫We will need to convert this into a percentage.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,800
‫Let's tackle both problems.

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,790
‫First, we will reduce the number of ticks drawn by the axis in the ED search for the section of our

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,220
‫code where we generate the axis function.

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,600
‫We can modify the ticks by modifying the axis bottom function.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,500
‫We are going to change a function called Tick's.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,430
‫The tics function allows us to override the number of ticks drawn, we must pass in a no, let's pass

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,120
‫in five.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,550
‫Next, let's go back to the page.

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,390
‫D3 has drawn less ticks, but the number of ticks don't align with the number we passed into the ticks

21
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,480
‫function, D3 is drawing four ticks.

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,210
‫We are getting less than what we asked for because D3 considers our number a recommendation.

23
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,320
‫D3 wants to evenly distributed ticks on the axis.

24
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,200
‫If it's unable to evenly distribute the ticks with the number we passed in, it'll attempt to find a

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,570
‫number of closest to what we passed in.

26
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:47,030
‫In some cases, we may want to take complete control over the number of ticks.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,680
‫That's completely possible.

28
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,390
‫Let's go back to the editor.

29
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,210
‫We will comment out the chicks function.

30
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,610
‫In its place, we will Cheney function called TEQ values.

31
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,830
‫The tick values function allows us to specify what topics should be drawn on the axis.

32
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,640
‫This function requires you pass an array of tick values.

33
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:20,150
‫We will pass an array with the numbers zero point for zero point five and zero point eight.

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,410
‫I'm picking random numbers, the numbers should be values that can be found within the input domain.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,410
‫If we were to enter lower or higher numbers, they might not appear on the axis.

36
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,050
‫Let's refresh the page.

37
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:44,270
‫We will find the custom ticks on the axis, D3 was able to calculate where to position them, their

38
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,710
‫oddly spaced out, but that's to be expected since our numbers aren't evenly distributed.

39
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,670
‫I prefer to let D3 handle picking the ticks back in the ED.

40
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,660
‫I'm going to comment about the tick values function and uncommented the ticks function.

41
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,730
‫Let's tackle the second problem, the ticks for the humidity are outputting decimal values, we want

42
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,160
‫to change the format into a percentage.

43
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:18,150
‫We can modify the labels for the ticks by changing a function called tick format to the x axis function.

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,640
‫The tick format function expects a function to be passed in we will pass in an arrow function.

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,240
‫The Arrow function has one parameter, which is the original label, we will refer to this parameter

46
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,020
‫as D..

47
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,900
‫The Arrow function must return a new label to be drawn under the check.

48
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,410
‫We know that the D parameter will be a decimal value.

49
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,750
‫We can multiply this parameter by 100 to get a whole number afterward.

50
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,960
‫We will append the percent symbol.

51
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,690
‫This should give us a better label for the chicks, let's refresh the page.

52
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,550
‫The labels under the ticks have been updated.

53
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,510
‫We will now see percentages.

54
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,560
‫Fantastic.

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,570
‫We are finished with the scatterplot.

56
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,650
‫It took a lot of work, but we finally made it.

57
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,070
‫In the next lecture.

58
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,260
‫We will review everything we did to accomplish this visualisations.
