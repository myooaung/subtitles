00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.600
‫In this lecture, we're going to start drawing the arcs of the pie, D3 comes with a function for helping

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.860
‫us draw the arcs.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.330
‫First, we need to decide what the radius of the overall pie will be.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.160
‫The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any of the edges.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.750
‫The pie should take up the entire space of the container.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.510
‫We can calculate the radius by dividing the width of the container by two in the script file, scroll

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.610
‫to where we created the dimensions.

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.440
‫At the bottom of this section we're going to define a variable called radius.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.900
‫Its value will be the following dimensions, container width divided by two.

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.510
‫D3 will need to know the radius because each arc will be the size of the radius, arcs are drawn from

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.750
‫the center of the circle to the edges of the circles with the radius and data already.

12
00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.020
‫Let's draw the arcs, scroll to the scales section of the code, remove the console statement.

13
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.470
‫We don't need it anymore.

14
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.010
‫Next, create a variable called ARC, its value will be the D3 arc function.

15
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.800
‫The ARC function will return a function that can draw an arc.

16
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.160
‫It's similar to the line function we dealt with in the previous project.

17
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.430
‫One question you may have is what's the difference between the ARC and PI functions?

18
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.470
‫The PI function will format your data, whereas the ARC function will draw and arc.

19
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.870
‫The ARC function will need to know the radius of our PI.

20
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.330
‫We can set the radius by changing a function called outer radius.

21
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.110
‫We will pass in the radius to the function.

22
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.370
‫The outer radius will tell these three to draw the arc from the center of the circle to whatever value

23
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.400
‫we pass into this function, when we draw the arc, we're going to be drawing it directly at the center

24
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.310
‫of the container.

25
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.730
‫The arc will be drawn to the distance of whatever we pass into the outer radius function.

26
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.510
‫Since the radius variable is equal to half the size of the container, the arcs should take up the entire

27
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.700
‫room of the container.

28
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.790
‫When we draw them, you'll see what this looks like in a moment.

29
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.600
‫There's another function we will need to change.

30
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.360
‫We're going to change the inner radius function with the value zero we passed in.

31
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.590
‫The inner radius function will add space at the center of the pie.

32
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.880
‫This will turn it into a doughnut chart.

33
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.180
‫We'll talk about doughnut charts later.

34
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.200
‫For now, passing in zero will prevent D three from drawing a doughnut chart.

35
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.520
‫Let's try drawing the ARC's.

36
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.440
‫The ARC function will return a function we can call to start drawing the arcs.

37
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.130
‫We're going to want to call this function on a path element.

38
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.630
‫There will be multiple path elements.

39
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.830
‫We should create a group for our path elements below.

40
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.200
‫We will add a comment that says Draw shape.

41
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.220
‫Next will create a variable called Ark Group.

42
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.700
‫It'll be set to the container append function.

43
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.590
‫We are going to create a group element.

44
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.350
‫Then we are going to reposition the group arcs are drawn from the center of the circle, the starting

45
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.250
‫point for each arc should always be at the center.

46
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.530
‫We will move the group to the center so that every arc will always be drawn at the center.

47
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.890
‫We will chain the attribute function to set the transform property.

48
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.850
‫The value for this attribute will be the following translate dimension's container height divided by

49
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.050
‫two comma dimensions, container width divided by two.

50
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.840
‫That'll position the shapes drawn inside this group at the center of the container, we can begin to

51
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.120
‫draw the arcs on another line.

52
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.910
‫We will use the ARC group selection to select the path elements with the select all function.

53
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.150
‫Afterward, we'll change the data function to join these slices with the selection.

54
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.290
‫Remember, these slices array contains our formatted data, the new data was created after passing our

55
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.440
‫original data through the pie function.

56
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.920
‫We can begin to draw the path elements by changing the join function.

57
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.290
‫We're using path elements because the value generated by the Ark function is only compatible with the

58
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.770
‫path element, we can change the shape of the path element by setting the attribute to the ARC function.

59
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.470
‫D3 will call the ARC function for each object in these slices array.

60
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.790
‫It'll provide the object to the ARC function, which will return a value for the path elements, the

61
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.480
‫attribute.

62
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.750
‫That'll finish it.

63
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.240
‫Let's refresh the page.

64
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.950
‫We have a pie that's great, but it's not easy to read, we haven't changed the colors of each slice.

65
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.050
‫You may be able to see each slice because D3 has added some spacing between each arc and the next lecture.

66
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.220
‫We're going to add some colors to the arcs to make them easier to identify.
