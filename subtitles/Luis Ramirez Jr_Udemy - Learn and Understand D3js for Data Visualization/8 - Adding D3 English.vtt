00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.320
‫In this section, we're going to start with the basics of D three, we're not going to create anything

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.250
‫fantastic before we can create complex charts, we need to understand the fundamentals of three.

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.420
‫We'll take the first step by adding D three into our project before starting point your editor to an

4
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.430
‫empty directory.

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.270
‫We're going to start fresh.

6
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.880
‫There are two files we're going to create.

7
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.210
‫The first will be in indexed HTML file.

8
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.730
‫Inside this file, we will scaffold some HTML by typing HTML Colen five.

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.040
‫The most important line we can add to our HTML file has been scaffolded for us at the top of the head

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.930
‫section, the character set is being set to UTF eight.

11
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.430
‫I always recommend adding this line, if you're going to use D three will be dealing with a lot of data.

12
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.300
‫Data can contain a wide variety of characters to prevent errors from appearing.

13
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.480
‫We should always set the characters set to UTF eight.

14
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.090
‫It makes working with D three easier.

15
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.860
‫The next file we're going to create will be called Applegate's.

16
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.850
‫You can use whatever name you'd like, I prefer to call it apt, just to keep it simple.

17
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.570
‫We're going to leave the JavaScript file empty for the time being after adding D3.

18
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.820
‫We're going to modify this file to code our charge.

19
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.900
‫Let's move on to the next step by adding D3 into the mix in the resource section, I provide a link

20
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.540
‫to the GitHub repository for D3.

21
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.960
‫If you're not familiar with GitHub, that's fine, GitHub provides a place for developers to host and

22
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.270
‫share their code with other developers.

23
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.020
‫D3 is an open source project where you can freely download, modify and install D three in our projects.

24
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.430
‫There are a couple of ways we can download three.

25
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.030
‫We're going to go with the simplest way of including these three.

26
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.680
‫We'll use a CDN.

27
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.290
‫If you're not familiar with the concept of a CDN, let me quickly break down what a CD and is.

28
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.890
‫CD N stands for Content Delivery Network.

29
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.420
‫There a vast network of servers that host static files like Cyesis JavaScript, where image is one of

30
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.380
‫the main issues of delivering files to the user is how long it takes for the file to reach them at the

31
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.070
‫annual store.

32
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.320
‫Copies of your files on different servers across the globe before a file is delivered to the user,

33
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.230
‫the network will figure out what server is closest to the user.

34
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.110
‫For example, if we're in New York, the CDN will deliver the file from a server located in New York.

35
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.150
‫If we live in India, it'll deliver the file from a server located in India.

36
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.700
‫CDs are intelligent enough to deliver the file from a server closest to the user.

37
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.330
‫This decreases the time it takes for a page to load.

38
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.560
‫D3 can be downloaded via a CDN.

39
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.020
‫We don't need to install additional tools to get started.

40
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.570
‫Actaeon works out of the box.

41
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.590
‫For that reason, we're going to use a CDN for learning D3, if we scroll down, we'll come across a

42
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.440
‫section called Installing.

43
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.790
‫There are two versions of D3 we can add to our project.

44
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.470
‫They both have the same features of D3.

45
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.840
‫There's one main difference between them.

46
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.710
‫The script with the word mean in its name is minified.

47
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.720
‫A file that has been minified means that the file has removed all formatting.

48
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.410
‫The indentation and whitespace are entirely removed.

49
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.980
‫I'm going to quickly open both files and separate tabs.

50
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.730
‫Here's the first scripts, as you can see, it's neatly formatted in the other tab, we have the minified

51
00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.290
‫version.

52
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.070
‫Everything has been compacted into one line.

53
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.790
‫The main advantage of magnification is that it reduces the size of a file.

54
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.970
‫It'll load quicker than the non minified version.

55
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.700
‫The one problem with the minified file is that debugging can be difficult.

56
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.170
‫The minified file is less descriptive.

57
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.650
‫Other than that, both files have the same features will be able to use these three completely with

58
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.570
‫either one generally.

59
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.070
‫As a rule of thumb, the unmined a fine version should be used for development.

60
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.470
‫When it's time to ship to production, you should switch to the minified version of D3.

61
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.710
‫Unless you want to view the core functionality of D3, the minified version will provide the fastest

62
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.370
‫performance back on the repository page will copy the script tag with the unmodified version.

63
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.580
‫We're going to use the unmanned afine version because it can be helpful to look at the code during development.

64
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.030
‫Feel free to use the minified version.

65
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.250
‫Next, we'll paste this into our document added inside the body tag.

66
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.590
‫For this course, we'll be using version six of D three, if you see a higher version, feel free to

67
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.910
‫use it all.

68
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.530
‫Code we write will be compatible with future versions of D3.

69
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.890
‫That's another great thing.

70
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:26.640
‫About three, it's effortless to upgrade from version to version with minimal braking changes will add

71
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.130
‫another script tag below the first one.

72
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.030
‫These scripts we're going to load is the app JS file.

73
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.690
‫You must load the Apgar's file after three has been loaded.

74
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.790
‫Otherwise, we may encounter errors when trying to use D3.

75
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.930
‫The order of scripts does matter.

76
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.080
‫Let's check if everything is working.

77
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.230
‫Open the file with the live server extension.

78
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.860
‫We'll find an empty page that's to be expected since the document is mostly blank.

79
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.130
‫Let's inspect the console with the developer tools.

80
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.410
‫We want to check if there are no errors in the console, if you don't see errors, congrats, you've

81
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.350
‫successfully installed these three in the next couple of lectures will start working with these three.
