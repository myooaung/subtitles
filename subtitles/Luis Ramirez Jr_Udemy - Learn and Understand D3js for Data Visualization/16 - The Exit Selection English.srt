00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,250
‫In this lecture, we are going to learn about the exit selection, the exit selection is the opposite

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,490
‫of the entire selection.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,300
‫It's an array of elements that should be removed.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,190
‫In some cases, we may have more elements than we have data.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,680
‫The access element should be removed.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,510
‫Whatever we call the data method, D3 will create an exit selection.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,160
‫Let's view what the exit selection looks like.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,150
‫First, we need to modify our current code base to be able to view it in the HTML file.

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,040
‫We're going to add five additional list items.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,050
‫The list items exceeded the number of items in the data array in our script.

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,400
‫We will need to comment out the joint and text methods.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,850
‫We are commenting on these lines because the Jawoyn method will return a new selection without the enter

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,240
‫and exit properties.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,940
‫We won't be able to view the exit property with these methods in the way after making that change.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,400
‫Let's refresh the page.

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,640
‫The page will render the list items they haven't been affected by a script yet in the console of the

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,570
‫developer tools, we will find the selection object has been logged.

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,090
‫The extra property will contain an array of elements that should be removed looking inside this array.

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,540
‫We will find the first five items in the array are empty.

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,790
‫That's to be expected since the first five items in the array were joined to the first five list items.

21
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:34,040
‫There are two lists items at the end of the array that don't have data Joynes to them in either of the

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,670
‫objects.

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,270
‫We won't find the data property we found in previous selections.

24
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,400
‫This information lets us know which elements we can safely remove back in our Ed, we are going to uncommented

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,500
‫the two lines we commented earlier.

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,560
‫They join method can be used for removing elements to it, can handle elements that need to be added

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,970
‫and elements that need to be removed.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,180
‫We don't need to modify our code.

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,520
‫The original code works as is.

30
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,080
‫Let's refresh the page.

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,310
‫They join Method successfully removed the excess elements in the console.

32
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,450
‫We will find the exit and enter properties are gone.

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,850
‫Great, we've got a working solution we never have to worry about having too little or too many elements,

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,900
‫the join method will intelligently handle both situations.
