00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.480
‫In this lecture, we're going to learn how to append elements in some cases we may need to add new elements

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.810
‫to the document that's completely possible with selections.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.400
‫We're going to continue working with files we had in the last lecture.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.040
‫We have one line that's selecting a paragraph tag.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.020
‫We removed all paragraph tags from our document.

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.710
‫Let's change the selection to the body tag.

7
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.160
‫The name of the variable should reflect the change to will change the variable name to Bonnie.

8
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.000
‫Let's say we want to add a paragraph element with D3, we can append an element by changing the append

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.410
‫method on the selection.

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.270
‫This method is a part of the D3 selection, library selection objects come with a method called append,

11
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.850
‫we can directly change this function after selecting an element.

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.030
‫Keep in mind, the object returned by the select method is wrapped with these three methods and properties.

13
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.010
‫The append will insert a new element into the current selection.

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.190
‫In this instance, an element will be inserted into the body tag.

15
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370
‫This method has one argument.

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.610
‫It's the name of the element we'd like to insert will pass in a paragraph tag.

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.160
‫Before we see what happens, the long statement should be updated to long the Bonnie variable.

18
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.420
‫Let's refresh the page in the browser.

19
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.680
‫We won't see anything on the page because the element we inserted doesn't have any content we can verify

20
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.770
‫if the paragraph element was inserted by using the developer tools under the elements, panel will find

21
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.030
‫the paragraph elements.

22
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.410
‫The Appen method is performing two actions, it's creating the element and then it's inserting the elements

23
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.760
‫into the current selection.

24
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.310
‫In this case, it would be the body tag.

25
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.160
‫If we look closely at the elements panel, it's apparent that the paragraph element is added towards

26
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.720
‫the end of the body tag.

27
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.640
‫Any new elements we inserted into a selection will be inserted at the end of the element.

28
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.480
‫That's why the paragraph appears below the script tags.

29
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.680
‫Let's switch over to the console.

30
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.090
‫There are two things to understand about the append method.

31
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.410
‫The append method will return a selection that's apparent because the object is labeled as a selection.

32
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.360
‫Let's view the selection returned by this method.

33
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.510
‫Inside the objects contents deselection is referencing the paragraph element rather than the body element.

34
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.190
‫This behavior is normal.

35
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.740
‫D3 will always return the selection of the element we inserted behind the scenes.

36
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.470
‫D3 will generate this new selection for you.

37
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.690
‫If we decide to perform additional actions, they'll be performed on the paragraph element instead of

38
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.710
‫the body element.

39
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.150
‫Let's go back to our code base for a moment.

40
00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.100
‫We're changing the methods, this idea of calling one method after the other is called chaining methods.

41
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.100
‫The three community heavily adopts this pattern.

42
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.980
‫In most examples and tutorials, you will frequently find that developers will change methods together.

43
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.760
‫It's something we'll get plenty of practice with by changing.

44
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.040
‫The methods will receive one selection.

45
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.690
‫In some cases, you may want to store the original selection.

46
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.530
‫Let's say I wanted to have variables for both the body and paragraph selections.

47
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.370
‫We can break this chain by creating a new variable called P.

48
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.700
‫Will assign this variable to the body append method.

49
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.050
‫Lastly, we can remove the appen method from the body variable.

50
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.210
‫The Bonnie variable will store the selection for the body elements and the variable will store this

51
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.850
‫election from the append method by splitting the selection into separate variables, we can continue

52
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.590
‫to interact with the body selection if we want to make further changes.

53
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.680
‫Breaking the chain may be useful for readability and reusability.

54
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.970
‫It's all preference.

55
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.580
‫Feel free to approach your code based on the project you're working on will be using a combination of

56
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.000
‫both.

57
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.630
‫You'll definitely get a feel for when to chain and when not to chain.

58
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.730
‫I'm going to undo these changes.

59
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.250
‫There isn't a reason to break our code down, its finances will end the lecture here.

60
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.500
‫We will continue learning about selection's in the next lecture.
