00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,300
‫In this lecture, we're going to talk about the issues with our pie chart, the first issue is with

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,760
‫how the labels are drawn.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,860
‫The age group should appear above the population.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,990
‫At the moment, the age group and population are side by side.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,320
‫They don't have much room to breathe.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,280
‫We're going to modify the coordinates of the labels to position the age group above the population.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,020
‫Switch back to the editor.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,840
‫We're going to modify the first selection for the age group before we write the age group.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,230
‫With the text function, we will change an attribute function.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:42,850
‫We're going to modify the wine attribute to move the text higher will set the wine attributes value

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,990
‫to negative for.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,330
‫This value will move the attribute higher, next will modify the why attribute for the second KeySpan

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,190
‫selection will change the attribute function before calling the text function.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,360
‫We're going to stop the why attribute to nine.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:11,870
‫One more thing, we're going to reset the X attribute for the second KeySpan selection to zero.

16
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,900
‫The reason we're resetting the X coordinate is because the text will not be directly positioned under

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,680
‫the age group.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,900
‫It'll be moved over to the left.

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:29,220
‫The X coordinate will need to be reset to zero so that the age group and population are aligned.

20
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,850
‫Let's refresh the page.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,290
‫The labels look much more readable, however, the smaller slices are difficult to read.

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,590
‫This is a common problem for some visualisations.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,950
‫You may have shapes that are too small to have labels.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,410
‫One solution that's commonly implemented is not showing a label at all.

25
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,750
‫We can fix our issue by hiding the population.

26
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,020
‫It's not very important for the reader to be able to view the population for every slice.

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,480
‫We'll leave the age group in the slice.

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,800
‫It's small enough to fit inside the shape.

29
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,750
‫Let's go back to the editor.

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,140
‫We're going to change function after the text selection in the second call function called filter.

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,040
‫The filter function is a new function I haven't introduced yet, we can use the filter function to filter

32
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,170
‫through selections.

33
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,650
‫It can be called on single or multiple selections.

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,010
‫The filter function will return a new selection.

35
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:35,460
‫The new selection is based on if the selection is able to pass its condition, we can set the condition,

36
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,020
‫bypassing in a function.

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,450
‫The function will be provided, the data as an argument will call the argument D.

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:55,090
‫We're going to return the following dot, end, angle, minus D dot start angle greater than zero point

39
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,930
‫two five.

40
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,420
‫We can calculate the width of each slice by subtracting the end angle, by the start angle, if the

41
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,840
‫width of the arc is too small, we should hide the population.

42
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,880
‫In this example, we're checking if the width is under zero point to five.

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,030
‫If it is, the condition will return false.

44
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,480
‫If the function returns false, D3 will not allow the selection to be passed on to the next function.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,590
‫By filtering the selection, the population will not appear if it's under a specific width.

46
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,280
‫Let's refresh the page.

47
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,680
‫The populations for the smaller slices don't appear great.

48
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,450
‫Let's fix one more issue.

49
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,310
‫I think the labels being positioned in the center of the arc don't give them much room.

50
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,720
‫I think it would be better if we could position them closer to the edge of the pie.

51
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,750
‫One trick is to change the inner radius.

52
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,560
‫In an earlier lecture, the inner radius was set to zero.

53
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,420
‫We didn't get the chance to see the impact this makes on our chart.

54
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,050
‫Let's go back to the ED search for where we defined the ARC function.

55
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,250
‫The inner radius function will allow us to convert the pie chart into a doughnut chart, a doughnut

56
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,770
‫chart is similar to a pie chart, except there's a hole in the middle of the chart.

57
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,200
‫We can add a hole to the chart by setting the inner radius with the inner radius function.

58
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,570
‫If we pass in zero, a pie chart will be drawn.

59
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,470
‫If we pass and any number other than zero, a hole will be drawn with the radius we pass in.

60
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,750
‫Let's change the inner radius to two hundred.

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,760
‫Switch back to the browser, the pie chart has changed to a donut chart.

62
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,220
‫What's even better is that the labels are closer to the edge.

63
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,830
‫This fixes our problem.

64
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,950
‫The labels are much more readable now.

65
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,320
‫However, it may not be the solution you're looking for if you don't want to change the pie chart to

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,050
‫a donut chart.

67
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,940
‫So how do we keep a pie chart while also moving the labels?

68
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,280
‫We can create another ARC function.

69
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:07,090
‫The second ARC function will have an inner radius of 200 will be able to use the second ARC function

70
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,600
‫for the centroid function.

71
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,390
‫Let's go back to the editor.

72
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,140
‫Below the ARC function will make a copy of the first ARC function.

73
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,640
‫We'll rename the variable to Arek labels.

74
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,530
‫Then we'll change the inner radius for the first arc to zero, the second arc will have an inner radius

75
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,460
‫of two hundred.

76
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:41,370
‫Scrolling down to where we drew the labels, let's replace the ARC object with the ARC's label object

77
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,050
‫in the transform attribute.

78
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,060
‫Let's refresh the page.

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,190
‫The labels are being drawn near the edge while we have a full pie.

80
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,310
‫We're almost done with the pie chart.

81
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,710
‫There's one less problem that needs to be fixed before we can consider this project complete.

82
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,070
‫D three will draw a pie charts in a clockwise direction starting from the top.

83
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,480
‫The first slice is for the age group 20 to 24, followed by the age group fifty to fifty four.

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,560
‫The problem with the pie chart is that it's not in order.

85
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,360
‫The order is inconsistent.

86
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:23,320
‫The reason we have an inconsistent order is because D three is sorting the slices by population.

87
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,090
‫If we were to look at the population instead of the age group will find that the slices are ordered

88
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,340
‫by population in descending order.

89
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,870
‫Let's open the data file in our editors for a moment.

90
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:44,150
‫The age groups are already sorted by age group in ascending order, so why is death sorting our data

91
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,840
‫differently?

92
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,890
‫In the script file, scroll to where we define the PI function.

93
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,840
‫The PI function is responsible for formatting our data on top of formatting our data.

94
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,750
‫It'll also sort our data.

95
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,850
‫The sorting order is based on the value we pass into the value function.

96
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,540
‫This is why D3 is sorting our data.

97
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,590
‫We can tell D3 not to sort the data by changing a function called sort.

98
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,520
‫We have the option of passing any function for sorting the data.

99
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,670
‫However, we don't want sorting.

100
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,340
‫Alternatively, we can pass in No.

101
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,850
‫Let's refresh the page one more time.

102
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,880
‫These slices have been sorted, we've successfully created a pie chart, drawing pie charts is a slightly

103
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,820
‫different process than most charts.

104
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,180
‫We didn't have to rely on a scale to help us draw the chart.

105
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:45,760
‫Aside from the color scale, the positioning and sizes were mostly performed by the arc and pie functions.

106
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,300
‫As long as you understand these functions, pie charts are easy to draw.

107
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,560
‫We'll explore more charts in the upcoming lectures.
