00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.360
‫In this lecture, we are going to draw a histogram histograms are great at showing a distribution of

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.120
‫values.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.140
‫Let's look at why you might want to draw a histogram.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
‫Currently, I'm showing these scatterplot we drew in an earlier section.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.120
‫Scatter plots are great at showing the relationships between two metrics that answers the question if

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.810
‫one metric affects the other one.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.460
‫If our question was how frequent a value appears, it's sort of hard to tell because the data is all

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.320
‫over the place.

9
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.870
‫Different questions require different visualizations.

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.840
‫We can answer this question with a histogram.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.970
‫Let's pretend we had an array of 10 numbers, the numbers range from 10 to 100, the question I may

12
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.800
‫have is how often does the number 10 appear in the array?

13
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200
‫What about 50 or 100?

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.270
‫We can answer these questions by counting the numbers in the array.

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.790
‫However, that will not suffice for more complex data structures.

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.330
‫We can draw the frequency of each number with a histogram.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.830
‫A histogram will tell us how values are distributed in a data set, the x axis tells the range of bar

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.640
‫falls under.

19
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.100
‫For example, the first bar tells us how many numbers fall between 10 and 20.

20
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.750
‫The second bar tells us how many numbers fall between 20 and 30.

21
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.030
‫The y axis of the chart tells us how many numbers are in each distribution.

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.540
‫The number 10 appears four times in the data set.

23
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.720
‫Some distributions don't have anything that's to be expected since there aren't any numbers in some

24
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.980
‫of the distributions.

25
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.650
‫When we draw a histogram D three will make sure there aren't empty distributions.

26
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.290
‫Sometimes you may hear a histogram referred to as a bar chart.

27
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.010
‫The words can be interchangeable at times.

28
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.920
‫However, there is a difference.

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.100
‫We will be drawing a bar chart in a future lecture.

30
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.300
‫Once we do, we will discuss the differences between a histogram and a bar chart.

31
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.370
‫For now, we will refer to this type of chart as a histogram.

32
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.410
‫Now that we understand what a histogram is, let's talk about what our histogram will do.

33
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.160
‫We are going to be drawing a histogram with our weather data.

34
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.160
‫There's a lot of data packed into the file we worked with previously.

35
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.600
‫We only use two metrics.

36
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.540
‫I think two ways to let the rest of the data go on.

37
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.030
‫Shown histograms are great at measuring one metric at a time.

38
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.680
‫We will create a histogram for some of the pieces of data in our weather data.

39
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.940
‫The reader will be able to switch between metrics as a bonus.

40
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.200
‫We will draw the median and mean.

41
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.230
‫Once you're ready, I'll see you in the next lecture.
