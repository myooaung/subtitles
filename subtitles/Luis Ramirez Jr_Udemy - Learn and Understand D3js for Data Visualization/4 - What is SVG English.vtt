00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:08.160
‫In this lecture, we're going to talk about Fiji, Fiji is short for scalable vector graphics, D3,

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.400
‫heavily reliant on SVG to create charts and graphs, as Fiji has been around for a long time.

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.080
‫They're quite powerful as Fiji is a text based image format.

4
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.330
‫Typically, images can be created with the camera on our phones.

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.550
‫There are programs such as Photoshop that can create new images.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.550
‫The most common formats for images are JPEG, PNG and Gift's.

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.900
‫You've most likely dealt with these types of images.

8
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.210
‫There's another format available called SVG.

9
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.260
‫SVG images aren't generated like traditional images rather than it being something that a program or

10
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.510
‫device can generate.

11
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.050
‫It's generated with code code that you can read or write.

12
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.750
‫There are programs that we can download for working with Fiji, images we don't need to write code to

13
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540
‫create SVG images.

14
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.360
‫However, we won't be exploring that option for this course.

15
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.640
‫We're going to focus on how we can create SVG images with code.

16
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.340
‫I want to step back for a moment and take a look at this phrase scalable vector graphics.

17
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.030
‫What exactly does that mean?

18
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.060
‫And SVG image is generated with math.

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.590
‫To better understand.

20
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.010
‫Let's take a look at a vector image and a regular image.

21
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.790
‫I'm using a program called Illustrator, you do not need to have Illustrator installed.

22
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.030
‫I'm using illustrator for demonstration purposes.

23
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.650
‫As you can see, I have two circles.

24
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.510
‫The one on the left is a vector and the one on the right is a regular image.

25
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.240
‫From this distance, they both look the same.

26
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.470
‫But let's see what happens when I begin to zoom in on both images.

27
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.320
‫The circles looked nearly identical, at one hundred percent by zooming in, we can start to see some

28
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.340
‫of the differences.

29
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.040
‫The left image is smooth and crisp.

30
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.350
‫The image on the right is distorted.

31
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.560
‫If we continue to zoom, the vector image will always look clean compared to the regular image on the

32
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.970
‫right.

33
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.760
‫It doesn't matter how far we zoom in or out, the vector will always look consistent and clean.

34
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.710
‫The regular image will continue to look distorted and pixilated.

35
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.680
‫The reason the image on the left never loses quality is because our computer generates the image.

36
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.510
‫It's happening in real time.

37
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.140
‫Our computers are using math equations to calculate how the image should appear on our screens.

38
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.650
‫Let's take a look at another example.

39
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.220
‫I'm going to zoom back out so we can see both images.

40
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.900
‫One of the flaws with regular images is trying to resize them, resizing an image doesn't guarantee

41
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.670
‫we get to keep the same quality.

42
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.490
‫I'm going to resize the image on the right.

43
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.710
‫I've squeezed the circle to shorten its height.

44
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.080
‫If you look at the edges of the circle, the consistency has been lost.

45
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.500
‫The left and right side of the circle is thicker than the top and bottom sides.

46
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.920
‫We've lost consistency with our circle, which makes it look distorted.

47
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.900
‫Let's see what happens if I do the same to the image on the left.

48
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.420
‫The image has been scaled correctly, the edge of the circle is still smooth and consistent.

49
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.150
‫We're not experiencing the same loss of quality as we did with the circle on the right vector.

50
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.120
‫Images are easier to work with.

51
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.900
‫We never lose quality regardless of how we treat the image.

52
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.320
‫So you may be wondering why am I showing you this?

53
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.710
‫The technology that powers this program is the same technology that powers SVG images on the Web.

54
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.560
‫We can use SVG images, we can resize them, change their shape and move them around.

55
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.310
‫We never have to worry about a loss of quality.

56
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.770
‫This is what's called scalable vector graphics.

57
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.630
‫It's an image that's created using mathematics and commands that are a lot of advantages for using SVG

58
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.360
‫images.

59
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.400
‫That doesn't mean they're perfect.

60
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.280
‫There are some flaws with SPG images.

61
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.060
‫SVG images require a lot of resources.

62
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.200
‫The more detail and image is, the more resources are required.

63
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.920
‫If we were to change in SVG image, our computers would need to rerun the calculations to generate the

64
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.050
‫image for a simple circle.

65
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.560
‫It isn't difficult at all to recalculate its shape, but what if we had to resize a detailed portrait?

66
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.930
‫As you can imagine, a lot of resources would be needed to update the smaller details.

67
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.520
‫SPG images are perfect for basic shapes and graphics.

68
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.900
‫It's primarily used for creating animations or web graphics.

69
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.670
‫It's also great for comics and basically anything that isn't super detailed.

70
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.310
‫These three can be used on the Web.

71
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.070
‫It can work with regular HTML elements, canvases and SVG images.

72
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.150
‫We're not limited to one specific technology, however.

73
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.670
‫It's commonly used with SVG images because of how flexible SVG images are.

74
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.150
‫Charts may need to be resized for different devices.

75
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.130
‫Interactive charts may need to be redrawn if data is added or removed.

76
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.630
‫This makes SPG the ideal candidate for working with these three.

77
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.100
‫There's one last thing I want to mention before moving on to the next lecture.

78
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.830
‫D3 takes care of all the heavy lifting.

79
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.180
‫SVG can become difficult to write the more complex an image is.

80
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.690
‫Luckily, we won't have to dig too deep into SFG because D3 can handle the harder tasks.

81
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.810
‫That's why developers loved three so much.

82
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.350
‫It makes working with charts so much easier.

83
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.800
‫The purpose of the D three library is to make things easier for you.

84
00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.650
‫You don't have to memorize every single element and attribute there is for SVG images.

85
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.590
‫It's more important that you do understand what's going on and why certain things behave the way they

86
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.980
‫do.

87
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.090
‫We'll continue talking about SPG images in the next lecture.
