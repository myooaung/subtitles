00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.840
‫In this lecture, we're going to start fixing the transition, we know where the problem lies for shapes

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.400
‫entering the document, their starting positions are not ideal.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.030
‫We will want to change their starting positions before starting the animation.

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.270
‫If we want to be able to set the initial coordinates for the bars before starting the transition, we'll

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.570
‫need to override the joint functions default behavior.

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.350
‫The argument we're passing into the joint function is a string.

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.490
‫It's the name of the element we want to add, update or remove.

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.360
‫Instead of passing in, a string will pass in an arrow function.

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.380
‫The first function we pass into the joint function will be for the enter selection.

10
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.790
‫That's perfect.

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.060
‫It's the selection we want to modify.

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.060
‫We will be provided an argument called Enter, which will accept.

13
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.020
‫This function must return a selection that will be merged with the current selection.

14
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.260
‫We will return the entire selection.

15
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.900
‫Since we're passing in a function for the first argument, we must add the element that will be joined

16
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.610
‫to the data.

17
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.490
‫We will change the appen function with the rectangle element.

18
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.890
‫After creating the element, we are going to add the attributes, the values for the coordinates and

19
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.660
‫dimensions will need to be set.

20
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.100
‫Fortunately for us, we have already written the code for these attributes.

21
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.120
‫We can copy the code below and paste it after the append function.

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.020
‫The attributes we've changed are the width, height, X, Y and Phil attributes, we are going to make

23
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.230
‫two changes to the attributes instead of a function, we are going to set the height attribute to zero.

24
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.110
‫As for the why, attribute will set it to the dimensions, container, height, property.

25
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.950
‫Here's what will happen, these three will run the function we're passing in for the enter selection,

26
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.490
‫a rectangle element will be inserted into the document.

27
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.430
‫It'll be joined with the data.

28
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.350
‫We are also adding attributes to the element.

29
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.840
‫The selection will be merged with the current selection because we're returning it from the function.

30
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.420
‫After merging these selections, the joint function will return a new selection.

31
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.750
‫This selection will have the transition applied to it.

32
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.990
‫D3 will begin the process of updating the attributes for each element in the selection.

33
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.110
‫For the most part, we won't have to update the attributes for the elements created by the enter selection.

34
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.810
‫The only attributes that will be modified are the height and we attribute the height.

35
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.670
‫Attribute will start at zero.

36
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.000
‫It'll grow to its appropriate size.

37
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.470
‫The same goes for the Y attribute.

38
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.260
‫The bar will be positioned at the bottom of the container and move up to its appropriate coordinate.

39
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.430
‫Before we test our code, there's one last adjustment we'll make.

40
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.280
‫We will chain a duration function with a value of three thousand after the transition function.

41
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.820
‫The duration function will change the iteration of the transition, the value you pass into the function

42
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.970
‫will be the duration in milliseconds.

43
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.470
‫We are setting the duration two, three seconds because we want to be able to see the animation.

44
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.170
‫When we're satisfied with the animation, we will adjust the duration to a shorter length.

45
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.760
‫Let's refresh the page.

46
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.570
‫The bars will animate by rising into place if we were to switch between metrics.

47
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.620
‫The problem we had before is gone.

48
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.780
‫The animation is playing smoothly.

49
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.760
‫That's awesome.

50
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.670
‫There's one more problem with the animation.

51
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.580
‫If we were to remove bars, they wouldn't get animated, for example, switching from the temperature

52
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.600
‫to the humidity.

53
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.840
‫We're going to address this problem in the next lecture.

54
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.950
‫I'll see you there.
