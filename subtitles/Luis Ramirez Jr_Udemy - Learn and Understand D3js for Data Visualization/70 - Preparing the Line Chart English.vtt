00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.850
‫In this lecture, we're going to start drawing the first chart for this section, we will be drawing

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.600
‫a line chart there, a very popular type of chart to draw.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.050
‫A line chart displays data that changes over time.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.910
‫Line charts are drawn with dots that are connected with one long continuous line.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.910
‫For this example, we will be drawing a line chart that shows Apple's stock price over time.

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.360
‫In the resource section of this lecture I provide is it file with the starter files, download the zip

7
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.650
‫file, unzip the contents and appoint your editor to those files.

8
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.620
‫Pause the video if you need to.

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.550
‫Let's review the files together.

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.250
‫Open the index, not HTML file.

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.550
‫We have a basic template inside this template, we have a development with the idea of charge, we're

12
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.840
‫going to draw the chart inside this element.

13
00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.060
‫Other than that, we're loading three files, a stylesheet script and three, these stylesheet doesn't

14
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.680
‫contain anything special.

15
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.570
‫Let's inspect the script file.

16
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.790
‫We have a function called draw inside this function, we're requesting a file called Data Doxie ASV.

17
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.570
‫We've mostly been working with Jason Files up until this point.

18
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.380
‫I'm mixing things up by storing the data in a ASV file.

19
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.010
‫We are using the D3 CSFI function to perform a request for this file.

20
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.540
‫Let's open this file in our editor's.

21
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.460
‫There are two columns in this file there, the date and closing price, the closing price is the price.

22
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.750
‫A stock was sold when the stock market closed for the day.

23
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.110
‫The data in this file ranges from two thousand seven to twenty twelve.

24
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.420
‫We have about five years worth of data.

25
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.140
‫Do three will convert each row of data into an object.

26
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.460
‫The objects will be stored in an array back in the script file after grabbing the final data.

27
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.840
‫We're creating access or functions.

28
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.720
‫The date will be drawn across the x axis.

29
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.470
‫The X accessor function will return the date from the data.

30
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.310
‫The property name worth a date will be stored is called date.

31
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.330
‫The price for the stock will be drawn across the Y axis.

32
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.600
‫The Y accessor function will return the price.

33
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.830
‫The name of the property where the price is stored is called close.

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.200
‫After preparing our data, the function will start creating the dimensions of the chart.

35
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.840
‫This includes the dimensions for the container.

36
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.650
‫For the chart.

37
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.190
‫We are creating a container for the chart.

38
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.620
‫It's important to make sure the shapes don't get cut off.

39
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.960
‫If they appear near the images border, then we are drawing the image and container.

40
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.770
‫Both selections are using the dimensions.

41
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.810
‫The first selection is the SVG image.

42
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.410
‫The second selection is the container inside the image.

43
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.100
‫The final piece of code in this function is the scales.

44
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.040
‫I've gone ahead with preparing one scale for you.

45
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.070
‫The wide scale function will transform the closing price in our data in two values that can be drawn

46
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.390
‫on the page, we'll be using a linear scale to transform this value.

47
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.210
‫We already know how the linear scale works.

48
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.880
‫It's a continuous to continuous scale.

49
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.080
‫The domain ranges from the lowest to the highest prices in the data.

50
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.430
‫The three extent function will help us grab those prices.

51
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.530
‫As for the range, it's being set with the values in the dimensions.

52
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.670
‫Lastly, the nice function is change to round the values in the domain.

53
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.930
‫Now that we have an overview of things, let's begin drawing the chart.

54
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.030
‫We'll get started in the next lecture.
