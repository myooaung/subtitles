00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.290
‫In this lecture, we're going to learn about transformation methods.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.900
‫We have a good understanding of how to make selections after making a selection, we will need to make

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.310
‫changes to the selection.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.100
‫This is where transformation methods come into play.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.410
‫I'm on the D three selection documentation page.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.220
‫There's a section called Modifying Elements.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.960
‫Scroll down to this section.

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.880
‫Let's read the description together after selecting elements, use these selections, transformation

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.040
‫methods to effect document content.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.860
‫In layman's terms, transformation methods are a way to modify a selection.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
‫The phrase transformation method.

12
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.760
‫It's fancy terminology for functions that modify in elements, properties, their functions that are

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.360
‫available.

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.660
‫After making a selection, we can use them to add attributes, change the inner content or add styles.

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.060
‫Actually, we've already used one transformation method.

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.560
‫If you scroll down, you'll come across the append method.

17
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.670
‫The append method allowed us to insert a new element into the selection.

18
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.390
‫It transformed the selection into a new one, hence why they're called a transformation method.

19
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.100
‫There's one important point to understand about transformation methods.

20
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.450
‫They will always return a new selection.

21
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.180
‫The new selection will be the previous selection.

22
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.490
‫But with the changes the function made to it, let's explore some of the other transformation methods

23
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.440
‫at our disposal.

24
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.690
‫Back in our ED, we have a selection called body.

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.370
‫Technically, the selection in return is a paragraph elements.

26
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.030
‫Let's change the variable name to E-L, which is short for element.

27
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.890
‫We have a selection ready, let's transform the paragraph elements, one of the transformation methods

28
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.780
‫we can use is called attribute.

29
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.330
‫Let's change this function to our selection.

30
00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.390
‫I'm changing this after appending the paragraph elements in this case, the attribute function will

31
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.170
‫be applied to the paragraph element, since that is the current selection.

32
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.720
‫If we wanted this function to apply to the body elements, we would have to change it after selecting

33
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.740
‫the body elements.

34
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.440
‫The attribute function allows us to add an HTML attribute to an element.

35
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.210
‫It has two arguments there, the name of the attribute and the value for the attribute.

36
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.610
‫The second argument is optional.

37
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.490
‫If you decide not to use the second argument, D3 will assume you wanted to return the attributes current

38
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.020
‫value.

39
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.460
‫Let's try adding a class attribute.

40
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.520
‫For this example or at a class food to the selection.

41
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.910
‫We'll check the Rouzer in a moment before we do, let's look at another transformation method.

42
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.200
‫After adding an attribute, let's change a new function called text.

43
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.530
‫The text method is another transformation method.

44
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.620
‫It has one optional argument if we don't pass in an argument, the text function will return the text

45
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.190
‫content.

46
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.250
‫Inside the current selection we can pass in a string to replace the current text content will pass in

47
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.290
‫a string that says Hello World.

48
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.910
‫One last thing before we test our code, let's update the council statement to log the E-L variable.

49
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.680
‫Switch over to the browser to view the results.

50
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.020
‫We'll be greeted with the message our script is working as we wanted it to.

51
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.160
‫Let's view the elements panel and the developer tools.

52
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.310
‫The paragraph hag has the class attribute added to it, it has the FU class applied to it great.

53
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.270
‫We were able to generate a paragraph tag with a class and some text.

54
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.670
‫Let's switch over to the console panel.

55
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.970
‫The console is logging a selection object that we were should look inside the group array.

56
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.920
‫We will find the paragraph element is selected.

57
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.730
‫The transformation methods we were using will always return the selection with the modified changes,

58
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.100
‫it allows us to change multiple transformation methods.

59
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.540
‫We don't have to make an entirely new selection if you want to apply changes to the same selection.

60
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.280
‫We're always working with the latest selection after training each method.

61
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.490
‫Let's switch back to our editors.

62
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.220
‫The great thing about transformation methods is being able to change multiple methods together, the

63
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.280
‫attribute method will return the paragraph selection.

64
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.260
‫We can then directly change the text method, since the text method is available on all selection objects,

65
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.990
‫D3 will know which element we want to apply the changes to.

66
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.250
‫We've got a functioning script, but there's one problem we should address.

67
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.640
‫We've written everything in one single line.

68
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.450
‫The way we formatted our code is unreadable.

69
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.000
‫It's uncommon to chain at least three methods in one line.

70
00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.680
‫If that's the case, it's better to put every function on a separate line like so.

71
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.400
‫It's common practice to put every function on a separate line with an indentation, you will find this

72
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.930
‫formatting practice across most examples and tutorials.

73
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.130
‫We will format our code like this whenever we're changing methods for the rest of this course.
