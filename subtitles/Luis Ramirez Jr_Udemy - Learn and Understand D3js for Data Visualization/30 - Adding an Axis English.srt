00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,820
‫In this lecture, we were going to add an access to the scatterplot we've been drawing, it's difficult

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,670
‫to read the chart unless we have something to reference.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,620
‫And Axis is a great way to help readers understand data.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,610
‫Drawing an axis can be tedious because of how many factors can affect an axis.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,390
‫And axis consists of a line, ticks and labels.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,780
‫The ticks are the line sticking out of the line and axis looks simple, but it can be challenging to

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,630
‫draw a sign from positioning and signs saying we need to figure out how many labels should be added

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,560
‫to an axis.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,270
‫The ticks need to be evenly distributed.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,770
‫There's a lot that we need to figure out for drawing an axis.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,340
‫D3 comes with a solution for drawing an axis.

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,200
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a library called D three axis.

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,640
‫The D three axis library comes with methods for drawing an axis.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,540
‫Unlike scales, these methods will draw the axis for you.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,290
‫All it needs is information about our data.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,910
‫It'll figure out the rest.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,250
‫Let's read the description of the Axis Library together.

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,980
‫The Axis component renders human readable reference marks for scales.

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,280
‫This alleviates one of the more tedious tasks in visualizing data.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:23,450
‫As the description says, this library was introduced for performing the task of drawing an axis by

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,050
‫default.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,440
‫The three axis library is bundled with the core.

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,970
‫We don't need to do anything else to make it available to us.

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,970
‫There are four functions we can use for drawing and axis.

25
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,940
‫There are two functions for drawing a horizontal axis and another two functions for drawing a vertical

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,610
‫axis.

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,520
‫Let's explore them in detail.

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,480
‫The two functions for drawing a horizontal axis are called axis top and axis bottom.

29
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,630
‫The difference between them is the direction the tics and labels are drawn.

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,050
‫The axis top function will draw the ticks above the horizontal line.

31
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,290
‫The axis bottom function will draw any ticks below the horizontal line.

32
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,770
‫There isn't any other difference between them.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,060
‫The axis function you use will be based on the chart you're drawing.

34
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,960
‫Traditionally, a scatterplot has its tick's pointing down for a horizontal axis or going to be using

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,540
‫the axis bottom function.

36
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,690
‫The other two functions are called axis left and axis right.

37
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,000
‫They both draw a vertical axis.

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,790
‫The axis left function will draw an axis with the tick's and labels drawn to the left of the line,

39
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,230
‫whereas the axis right function will draw them on the right side of the line.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,120
‫We will be using the axis left function for drawing an axis for the scatterplot.

41
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:48,200
‫Let's begin drawing an axis, the first axis will draw will be the x axis, the x axis will measure

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,870
‫the humidity at the bottom of the function.

43
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,300
‫We will add a comment that says Axis.

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,050
‫In most parts, the axes are drawn after the shapes have been drawn.

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,010
‫We will follow this practice.

46
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,600
‫We are going to create a variable called x axis.

47
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,500
‫Its value will be the three axis bottom function.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,360
‫The axis bottom function will return a function for drawing an axis, we aren't going to call this function

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,910
‫immediately for reasons we'll get to in a moment, the function we're using will draw the text below

50
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,140
‫the horizontal line.

51
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,330
‫Gary needs to know information about our chart, such as the domain and range.

52
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,180
‫Fortunately for us, we don't have to change the same functions we had before.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,950
‫We can use our scale functions to help the axis function understand our data.

54
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,920
‫We can pass on our scale functions by changing the scale function.

55
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,160
‫The skill function will help these three understand how long the axis should be drawn, you don't know

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,390
‫how to evenly distribute the ticks and labels based on the scale function.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,840
‫The skill function has one argument, which is the scale to use we will pass in the skill function.

58
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,740
‫There is an alternative solution for passing on the scale to the axis function, instead of changing

59
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,430
‫the scale function, we can altogether remove it.

60
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,760
‫We will pass them the X scale function to the axis bottom function.

61
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,290
‫All access functions can be passed in the scale, both solutions do the same thing.

62
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,530
‫There isn't a right or wrong solution.

63
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,890
‫It's all preference.

64
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,990
‫I like this shorthand version, so I'll be using it throughout this course.

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,130
‫The X axis function is ready, we can call it, to draw the axis on the image.

66
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,980
‫However, before we do, we want to make sure it's being called on the correct selection.

67
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,010
‫We want the axis to be drawn inside the container.

68
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,690
‫We are going to call the container append method where we will pass MBG elements.

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,860
‫The axis will be drawn inside another group, we are drawing the axis in another group because the axis

70
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,860
‫functions will draw a lot of shapes.

71
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,640
‫This will get cluttered with our existing circles for organization reasons.

72
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,220
‫It's considered good practice to put the shapes drawn by an axis function into a separate group.

73
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,780
‫After creating the selection, we will start drawing the axis.

74
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,090
‫Every axis function by three will return a function for drawing the axis.

75
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,570
‫The x axis function can't be called directly.

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,540
‫D3 works by changing functions together, but the x axis function is independent.

77
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,940
‫It will not work well with this chain.

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,660
‫A trick to get around this is by using the call function, which will allow us to use the x axis function

79
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,380
‫in the chain.

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,220
‫We will change the call function with the x axis function.

81
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,370
‫The access will now be drawn.

82
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,560
‫Let's refresh the page in the browser.

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,600
‫The x axis has been drawn like we wanted, there's just one problem, it's positioned at the top of

84
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,250
‫the page.

85
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,560
‫The reason it's drawn at the top of the page is because we haven't moved it.

86
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,410
‫We will fix this in a moment.

87
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,360
‫Before we do, let's search for the group element that contains the x axis.

88
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,250
‫The group element contains several elements, D3 drew these shapes when we called the axis function,

89
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,770
‫as you can see, it's beneficial to group the shapes into a single group.

90
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,540
‫It allows us to know exactly how many shapes were drawn.

91
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,990
‫We have three lines of Code D three generated this axis for us.

92
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,880
‫Let's address the problem with the axis.

93
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,740
‫It's placed at the top of the chart.

94
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,750
‫We want the axis at the bottom.

95
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,070
‫Back in the ed.

96
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,140
‫We need to move the group element.

97
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,420
‫The group element is the container for the axis.

98
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,680
‫Keep in mind, any changes we apply to the group element are applied to these shapes drawn inside of

99
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:52,910
‫it.

100
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,480
‫We are going to move the group element by adding a transform property.

101
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,800
‫We will change the style transformation method after the call method.

102
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,530
‫The x axis function will return a selection will, you're allowed to apply transformation methods after

103
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,140
‫drawing the axis, we are going to set the transform property to retranslate why method.

104
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,830
‫Inside the translate win method, we will pass in the dimensions, not container property with the pixels

105
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,790
‫unit measurement.

106
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,640
‫This property will move the access to the bottom of the container.

107
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,020
‫Let's refresh the page to view the result.

108
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,940
‫Great, our access is appearing on the bottom in the next lecture, we will make some refinements to

109
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,810
‫the axis.
