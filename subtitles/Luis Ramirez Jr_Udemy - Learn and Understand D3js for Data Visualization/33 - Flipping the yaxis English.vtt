00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.730
‫In this lecture, we are going to address a problem with the Y axis for the scatterplot, you may have

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.380
‫noticed it already looking closely, the axis is going in the wrong direction.

3
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.650
‫The temperature can be read from coldest to warmest.

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.450
‫Usually the y axis for a scatterplot should be read from top to bottom.

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.850
‫The lower a circle is positioned.

6
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.040
‫The colder the temperature, the higher a circle is positioned, the warmer the temperature.

7
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.020
‫We have the exact opposite.

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.870
‫It's not just the axis that is incorrect.

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.390
‫These circles are also positioned incorrectly to better understand.

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.960
‫Let's go back to the editor.

11
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.780
‫In the app file, search for the piece of code where we drew the circles, we are going to add an attribute

12
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.520
‫to help us debug our problem.

13
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.720
‫After adding the coordinates, we will change the attribute method.

14
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.890
‫We will add an attribute called data temp, the value for this attribute will be the Y accessor function.

15
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.080
‫We are creating a custom data attribute for storing the temperature of the circle.

16
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.900
‫We will be able to see what temperature a circle represents.

17
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.600
‫Let's refresh the page.

18
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.040
‫I'm going to inspect a circle positioned at the bottom of the chart.

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.300
‫I can verify I'm looking at a circle by hovering my mouse over the elements in the Elements panel,

20
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.280
‫the browser will highlight it on the page.

21
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.100
‫The attribute has been successfully added.

22
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.030
‫The circle line viewing has a temperature of about 90 degrees.

23
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.570
‫Its y coordinate is incorrect.

24
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.570
‫We want circles with high temperatures to be positioned at the top of the chart, not the bottom.

25
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.600
‫So why is this happening?

26
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.040
‫Let's look at the chart I showed you in an earlier lecture.

27
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.040
‫Here's a visual example of our input domain and output range, the input domain is our range of temperatures.

28
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.850
‫The lowest temperature in the data set is 10.

29
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.420
‫The highest is 90.

30
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.100
‫This visual example shows how the input maps to the output.

31
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.620
‫If the temperature is 10 degrees, the coordinate on the Y axis would be zero.

32
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.750
‫That's where our problem begins.

33
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.510
‫The Y axis starts from top to bottom.

34
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.380
‫A shape with a zero y coordinate is drawn at the top.

35
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.350
‫The higher the number, the lower the shape is drawn.

36
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.630
‫The problem isn't with D three, it's how we're mapping the input to the output.

37
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.450
‫D three is assuming we want the lower end of our data set to be drawn at the top of the chart.

38
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.740
‫If we want to change this behavior, we simply need to reverse the output and this example, the input

39
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.320
‫is mapped to the higher end of the output.

40
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.540
‫By flipping the output range, D3 will map the input to the range appropriately.

41
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.730
‫Let's give it a try in the output method for the wide scale function, we will reverse the items in

42
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.290
‫the array.

43
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.040
‫Next, let's view the page.

44
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.910
‫Voila, everything is fixed, the temperature is being red from bottom to top, the Y positions of the

45
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.650
‫circles have also been altered.

46
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.360
‫The axis and circles are using the wide scale function to calculate their positions.

47
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.460
‫We didn't have to modify our entire code base.

48
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.590
‫The temperature can be red from bottom to top.

49
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.480
‫The lower a circle, the colder the temperature.

50
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.710
‫This is one of the more interesting features of scales.

51
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.500
‫If we want to reverse the output, we can.

52
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.150
‫D3 is capable of reversing the values to accommodate our situation.

53
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.380
‫In the next lecture, we will continue with refining these scatterplot.
