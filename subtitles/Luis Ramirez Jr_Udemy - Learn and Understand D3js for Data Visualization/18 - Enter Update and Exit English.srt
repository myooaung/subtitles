00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,440
‫In this lecture, we are going to learn how to modify the behavior of the join method, the join method

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,800
‫does a lot for us already.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,630
‫We may need to customize the default behavior.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,400
‫For example, we can play an animation when an element is entering or exiting the page in our script.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,000
‫We are passing in a string to the join method.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,710
‫The join method will append new elements if there is data in the enter selection.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,450
‫The element, it depends, will be based on the string we pass in.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,650
‫This is one way of using this method.

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,650
‫We can customize the behavior of the join method by passing in three functions.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,210
‫It's optional to pass in three functions.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,230
‫Each function will be called for different scenarios.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,490
‫The first function is called Wendys three is working with the enter selection.

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,480
‫The second function is called when the current selection needs to be updated.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,980
‫The last function is called Wendys three is working with the exit selection.

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,120
‫Let's look at each one closely.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,700
‫The first function is for the enter selection.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,240
‫Let's pass in a function instead of a string.

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,880
‫This function has one parameter, which is the enter selection.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,340
‫Inside this function, we can do whatever we want to the selection, we can change transformation methods.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,150
‫After all, the entry parameter is a selection by using a function.

21
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,150
‫These three will not behave normally.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,150
‫It will not insert a new element into the document and said we have full responsibility for what happens

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,390
‫to the enter selection.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,650
‫Let's get back to the behavior we had before.

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,500
‫Inside the function, we will change the append method on the enter selection object.

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,070
‫The name of the element we want to append is called list item.

27
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,470
‫One of the important steps is to return a selection.

28
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,370
‫The function must always return a selection.

29
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,090
‫If we don't, D3 will not merge the entire selection with the current selection.

30
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,660
‫I'm going to modify this function, not to return the selection to demonstrate what happens if we didn't

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,920
‫return a selection.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,100
‫Since we are working with the interests election, we will update the HTML file by reducing the list

33
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,600
‫to three list items.

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,210
‫Next, we will refresh the page.

35
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:24,620
‫D3 will be able to open a new list items, however, the last two list items are not displaying their

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,590
‫respective data.

37
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,700
‫It's because the function did not return a selection.

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,710
‫D3 will not merge the enter selection with the list selection we had in our code.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,810
‫Let's look at our code for a moment.

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,610
‫The text method is changed after the join method, the text method will be applied to whatever selection

41
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,430
‫is returned by the join method, the join method will return the original selection without the entire

42
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,780
‫selection merged with it.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,220
‫Therefore, D3 will not even be aware of the new list items.

44
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,410
‫We are going to return the selection.

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,520
‫Let's look at our browser again.

46
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,700
‫The list items are displaying the data great, I find that most beginners forget this step, which is

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,240
‫why I'm emphasizing returning the selection.

48
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,590
‫It can be an easy mistake to make in our script.

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,510
‫The function we've written performs the same behavior that the joint method already performs.

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,010
‫Let's say we wanted to make it easier to identify which elements are new.

51
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,070
‫We can change the style method.

52
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,770
‫After upending the last item.

53
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,660
‫We will change the color of the text to purple.

54
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,170
‫One of the benefits of passing in a function is that we can apply different methods to different selections,

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,920
‫the style method will only be applied to the entire selection.

56
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,590
‫The elements that are updated or exiting the document will remain unaffected in the browser.

57
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,790
‫Refresh the page.

58
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,370
‫The last two list items have changed their color to purple.

59
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,540
‫It's very easy to identify which elements are new to the document.

60
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,750
‫There are other cool things we can do, such as animating the elements into the page.

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,710
‫I have a section dedicated to animations.

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,550
‫It's not something we will be covering in this lecture.

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,610
‫Let's explore the other two functions back in our script.

64
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,800
‫Let's pass in two functions to the joint method.

65
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,170
‫The second function will allow us to work with the update selection, the update selection represents

66
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,960
‫the elements that are being updated.

67
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,520
‫The Jawoyn method will allow us to work with the elements that already have data joined to them.

68
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,640
‫Our function has one parameter called update.

69
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,360
‫In our function, we will return the update selection.

70
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,920
‫This is the default behavior, D3 will return the selection, meaning nothing will happen to our current

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,480
‫existing elements, let's make it more exciting by changing the style method.

72
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,770
‫We will change the color of the text to green.

73
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,700
‫Before we do the page, let's work on the last function, the last function is called for the exit selection.

74
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,780
‫If we define this function, D3 will expect us to remove the element and return the selection.

75
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,300
‫It has one argument, which is the exit selection.

76
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,640
‫We haven't gone over how to remove elements with these three, we can remove an element by calling the

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,190
‫remove function on a selection object.

78
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,610
‫This is the default behavior, we aren't going to do anything else with our exit selection, the order

79
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,740
‫of the functions matter.

80
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,270
‫The first function will always be provided, the interest selection, the second function will be provided,

81
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,610
‫the update selection.

82
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,610
‫And lastly, the third function will be provided the exit selection.

83
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,000
‫Let's refresh the page on the browser to see what happens.

84
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,160
‫The first three list items are the color green because we changed the color on the update selection.

85
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,190
‫Everything else is working fine.

86
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,810
‫D3 gives us complete control over how each selection can behave.

87
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,980
‫If we don't like the evil behavior that wraps it up for the joint method.

88
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,110
‫In the next lecture, we will explore an alternative solution to the join method.
