‫In this section, we're going to discuss some final topics before concluding the course, as you've

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.080
‫seen so far, drawing charts can be challenging.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.190
‫It's because data comes in all shapes and sizes.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.060
‫One of the challenges of drawing a visualization is choosing a visualization.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.800
‫You will always want to make sure your data can be easy to read.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.630
‫One of the worst things that can happen is wasting time drawing your data only to realize the visualization

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.340
‫you've chosen is not suitable.

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.100
‫You would have to scrap everything and start over.

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.480
‫One simple trick for choosing the best visualization is to sketch it.

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.190
‫There are a lot of benefits to sketching before writing a single line of code.

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.860
‫Firstly, you won't waste time writing a visualization that is not suitable for your data.

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.200
‫By sketching out the graph, you will be able to quickly judge what does and doesn't work.

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.360
‫Secondly, it makes collaboration more accessible to your team and clients.

14
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.780
‫Your teammates will be able to provide quick feedback.

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.240
‫Being able to add to your sketch will make it easier to understand the needs of your clients.

16
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.400
‫Let's look at an example of how we would draw a sketch.

17
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.430
‫Typically you would use a pen and paper sketches should be quick and simple.

18
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.210
‫You don't need a ruler, nor do you need a special kind of paper.

19
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.070
‫For this example, I'm going to be using Illustrator and the paintbrush tool.

20
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.410
‫Let's say I wanted to create a graph for displaying the population for each continent.

21
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.650
‫For this type of visualization.

22
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.260
‫I would most likely choose a bar graph or scatterplot.

23
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.110
‫I'm going to begin sketching out the bar graph.

24
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.170
‫I want you to notice that I'm not trying to be neat or clean with my sketch, I'm just trying to get

25
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.930
‫an overview of what I want things to look like while I'm not drawing everything cleanly, I am making

26
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.490
‫sure it's still readable.

27
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.800
‫This didn't take me long to make.

28
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.000
‫It took less than two minutes, but I now have a sketch of a bar graph.

29
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.980
‫After looking at it, I feel comfortable moving forward writing the code for this.

30
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.080
‫If I didn't like it, I could just delete it and start creating another type of chart I think would

31
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.430
‫be suitable for the job.

32
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.340
‫You don't need any fancy program for this.

33
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.820
‫Like I said before, pencil and paper work just fine.
