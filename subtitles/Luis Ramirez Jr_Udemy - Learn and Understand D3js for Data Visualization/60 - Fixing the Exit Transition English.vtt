00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.430
‫In this lecture, we're going to animate the vase when they're leaving the document, we've already

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.170
‫discussed why this is happening.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.610
‫In summary, the bars are removed before the transition is applied.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.180
‫Therefore, D3 will not animate the elements.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.280
‫We can fix this issue by overriding the default behavior in the joint function.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.140
‫In our script, we're passing any function to the joint function.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.730
‫This function will run for the enter selection this time around.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.370
‫We're interested in running a function during the exit selection.

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.460
‫We will need to pass in another erro function.

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.170
‫This function will run for the update selection, the update selection is a list of elements that need

11
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.080
‫to be updated.

12
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.780
‫We're going to accept the update selection as an argument and return it.

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.070
‫This is the default behavior.

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.910
‫We aren't going to override the default behavior because the animation works fine without needing to

15
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.880
‫do anything, we will pass in a third function.

16
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.580
‫This function will run for the exit selection, this selection contains a list of elements that need

17
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.520
‫to be removed.

18
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.620
‫We are going to accept the selection as an argument and return it.

19
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.870
‫Then we will change the transition function.

20
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.160
‫Next, we will change the attribute method, the why attribute will be set to the dimensions, container,

21
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.090
‫height, property.

22
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.070
‫Afterward, we will chain another attribute method for the height this attributes value will be zero.

23
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.130
‫Lastly, we will remove the element with the remove function.

24
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.820
‫We are performing a transition on the exit selection.

25
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.750
‫The bar's already exists within the image.

26
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.720
‫We don't need to add every attribute we had before we can adjust the Y and height attributes to achieve

27
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.310
‫the effect we're looking for.

28
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.060
‫These two changes will make it look like the bars are shrinking.

29
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.110
‫After the transition is complete, D3 will remove the shapes with the remove function.

30
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.840
‫We don't have to worry about the shapes being removed too early.

31
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.300
‫D3 is smart enough to wait for the transition to complete before removing the shapes.

32
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.790
‫Let's try refreshing the page.

33
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.220
‫Everything seems to be working fine.

34
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.600
‫Let's switch from the temperature to the humidity metrics to see if the shapes can animated before being

35
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.190
‫removed.

36
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.160
‫Great, we've got a working histogram that can be animated.

37
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.810
‫There's one more adjustment I'd like to make before moving on.

38
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.830
‫I'll play the transition from the temperature to the humidity again.

39
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.150
‫The bars that need to move over are overlapping the bars that are being removed, it would be nice if

40
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.610
‫the bars would wait before increasing their width.

41
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.060
‫We can tell these three to wait for a transition to play before continuing another set of transitions

42
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.630
‫by storing the transition.

43
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.330
‫Let me show you what I mean.

44
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.100
‫Switch back to the ED above the code where we are drawing the shapes.

45
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.640
‫We are going to create a variable called exit transition.

46
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.200
‫We will assign this variable to the D3 transition function.

47
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.490
‫Instead of applying a transition to a selection, we are going to be storing the transition instance

48
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.910
‫into a variable, one of the properties that the transition function returns as a property called ID,

49
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.460
‫each transition comes with an ID.

50
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.500
‫These three uses this ID to help but keep track of which transition to play.

51
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.600
‫If we change multiple transitions at once, D3 will play the transitions according to their IDs.

52
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.010
‫However, we need to store the ID and pass it on to our transition functions.

53
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.230
‫Otherwise three will play multiple transitions at once.

54
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.660
‫We need to store the ID before playing the transition.

55
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.860
‫Now that we're storing the ID, we'll pass it onto the transition.

56
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.030
‫As you can tell from the name, this transition will be for the exit selection in function for the exit

57
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.810
‫selection.

58
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.620
‫We are going to pass the ID onto the transition function.

59
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.620
‫D3 will grab the ad from this object, the transition function has an optional argument, which is a

60
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.950
‫transition object to extract information from the ID is not the only thing D3 will use.

61
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.850
‫If we want, we can configure the transition through this object.

62
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.540
‫For example, let's say we wanted to change the duration.

63
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.910
‫We can change the duration function.

64
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.060
‫After the transition, we will set it to five hundred.

65
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.430
‫These three will use the transition from this object.

66
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.510
‫We're not done yet, we will create another I.D. for the elements that need to be updated below the

67
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.180
‫exit transition object.

68
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.430
‫We will create a variable called update transition.

69
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.050
‫Its value will be the exit transition transition function.

70
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.140
‫Here's one of the cool things about these three, we can tell D3 the order of the transition should

71
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.320
‫be played in by chaining them G three will generate an ID because we're storing the object returned

72
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.800
‫by the transition function.

73
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.000
‫However, in addition, it's aware that it should wait for the exit transition to play before playing

74
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.670
‫this transition or going to change the duration function with a duration of five hundred.

75
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.230
‫Next, we will pass this object into the transition function, we have changed after the joint function.

76
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.880
‫Since we're training the durations in the transition objects, we don't need to change the duration

77
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.280
‫function anymore after the join method.

78
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.810
‫Let's refresh the page in the browser.

79
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.970
‫We will perform the same test we did last time.

80
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.510
‫The bars will wait before the elements get removed.

81
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.240
‫It's much easier to understand what's happening.

82
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.250
‫We've completed the bars in the next lecture.

83
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.110
‫We will make a few more tweaks to the animations.

84
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.220
‫I'll see you there.
