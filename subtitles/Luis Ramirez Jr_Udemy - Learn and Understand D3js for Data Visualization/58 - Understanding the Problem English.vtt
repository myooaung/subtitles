00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.900
‫In this lecture, we're going to take the time to discuss the problem with our chart, switching between

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.950
‫metrics doesn't seem to be an issue.

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.120
‫However, the animations don't come off as normal.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.650
‫Let me show you what I mean.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.010
‫These transitions occur very quickly.

6
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.730
‫That's because by default, the animation is configured to play for a quarter of a second.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.460
‫I'm going to switch from the humidity to the temperature.

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.950
‫I'll play this in slo mo so that you can see the problem.

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.400
‫The animation for the bars starts at the top left corner.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.710
‫They animate into the correct spot.

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.810
‫The problem is that these starting positions are wrong.

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520
‫So why is this happening?

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.750
‫Keep in mind, all shapes have the coordinates of zero zero when we add shapes to the document.

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.470
‫They'll have an X and Y coordinate of zero.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.100
‫Their width and heights will also be zero.

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.100
‫Therefore their animations will start from zero to their respective values.

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.730
‫We can fix the animation by changing the starting positions before the animation plays.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.160
‫One thing to note is that this problem will only affect shapes that are added to the document.

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.760
‫Shapes that are being updated don't experience this issue.

20
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.180
‫Another problem is that these shapes being removed don't get animated.

21
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.970
‫Let's switch to the editor.

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.760
‫And the Ed, we're going to be focusing on the bars.

23
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.080
‫However, the issue affects the labels as well as for the access the animation works for our purposes.

24
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.180
‫We'll leave it alone once we fix the bars.

25
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.930
‫We'll move on to the labels.

26
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.270
‫Let's take a moment to understand what's happening with our code.

27
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.890
‫The first thing we're doing is joining the data with the selection.

28
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.300
‫These three will create three selections when we call the data function.

29
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.660
‫The first selection will be a list of elements that have had data Joynes to them.

30
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.000
‫The second selection is the enter selection, which is a list of items in our data that hasn't been

31
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.040
‫joined to an element in the document.

32
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.910
‫Lastly, the third selection is the exit selection, which are elements that don't have data joynes

33
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.430
‫to them because there isn't any data left.

34
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.490
‫After joining the data, we're calling the joint function to handle all three selections.

35
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.770
‫D3 three will generate new elements based on the number of items in the enter selection.

36
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.940
‫Elements in the exit selection will be removed.

37
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.110
‫As I mentioned earlier, elements that are being removed don't get animated.

38
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.260
‫It's clear as to why that's happening.

39
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.630
‫If we look at the code, the join method will return.

40
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.070
‫These selections merged.

41
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.730
‫However, the exit selection won't have anything because D3 will remove the elements before merging

42
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.660
‫these selections.

43
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.110
‫Therefore, they'll never be animated out of the document.

44
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.550
‫They'll just disappear.

45
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.470
‫We'll want to fix this, too.

46
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.810
‫We can fix the issue by taking over the process of removing and adding elements.

47
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.310
‫The join method has three optional arguments, which are all functions.

48
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.130
‫Each function will be called based on if an element is being updated, added or removed.

49
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.570
‫We will use these functions to our advantage to make a proper animation.

50
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.440
‫In the next lecture, we'll start implementing the solution.
