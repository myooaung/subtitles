00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.530
‫In this lecture, we're going to write an awful scale for transforming the age groups into colors.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.760
‫We're going to jump straight into it and the script file, scroll to the scales section of the code.

3
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.960
‫At the bottom of the section, the a variable called color scale, its value will be the D3 dot scale,

4
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.980
‫ordinal function.

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.940
‫Next, we will change the domain function.

6
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.800
‫Unlike other scales, we can't provide a range of values.

7
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.360
‫Instead, we need to provide a full list of values that should be transformed.

8
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.450
‫In our case, we're going to provide a list of age groups we're not going to pass in the entire data

9
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.890
‫array.

10
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.020
‫We will generate a new array with the age groups.

11
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.500
‫We can generate a new array based on our previous array.

12
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.070
‫By calling the map function inside the domain function, we will call the data set top map function.

13
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.860
‫The map function will loop through the array, it's called on after looping through the array, it'll

14
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.000
‫return a new array.

15
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.510
‫Inside this function we can pass in a callback for each iteration of the loop will pass in an arrow

16
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.840
‫function where we'll accept an argument called element.

17
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.290
‫The element argument will reference each object in the array, the array we're creating will be filled

18
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.200
‫with the names of the age groups.

19
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.570
‫We're going to return the element name property.

20
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.680
‫They don't mean we've created will be filled with a list of age groups, great, we can move on to creating

21
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.380
‫the range, we will change the range function.

22
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.790
‫We will pass in an array of colors, we'd like to transform the age groups to the question is where

23
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.000
‫do we get these colors?

24
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.930
‫We'll use the color scales that come with these three.

25
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.540
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to these scale chromatic package.

26
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.300
‫Search for the spectral scale, it can be found under the diverging section.

27
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.460
‫As we've learned, color scales can be used in two different ways, there's a function called INTERPOLATE

28
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.580
‫that takes in a value between zero and one based on the value we pass into the function, the function

29
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.590
‫will return to color within the scale.

30
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.890
‫Alternatively, these scheme property holds a list of colors based on the scale.

31
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.470
‫Usually we would use these scheme property.

32
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.990
‫However, the scheme property only contains a list of colors between three and 11.

33
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.950
‫If we need more than 11 unique colors, then we're out of luck.

34
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.210
‫Therefore, we'll need to use the INTERPOLATE function to generate unique colors.

35
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.940
‫We're going to call this function for every age group there is in our data set.

36
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.500
‫Switch back to the editor above the color scale.

37
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.600
‫We are going to define a variable called colors.

38
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.410
‫Its value will be the 3.0 quantize function.

39
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.140
‫The interpolate function will only return one color.

40
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.560
‫We're going to need a color for each group, therefore we'll need to call it multiple times.

41
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.100
‫The D3 quantize function allows us to call the same function repeatedly with different values.

42
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.990
‫The quantize function will return an array.

43
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.680
‫This function has two arguments.

44
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.150
‫The first argument is a function will pass in an arrow function.

45
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.320
‫The second argument is the number of times the function should be called we're going to pass in the

46
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.510
‫data set length property.

47
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.790
‫By using the length property, the function we passed into the first argument will run for every age

48
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.700
‫group in our data.

49
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.900
‫The function must return to value.

50
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.150
‫The value that's returned will be pushed into an array.

51
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.710
‫We're going to call the D three interpolate spectral function.

52
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.650
‫The interpolate function requires that you pass in a value between zero and one we must pass in numbers

53
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.190
‫that are evenly spread out based on the number of items in the array.

54
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.550
‫Luckily, the quantize function helps us with this situation.

55
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.540
‫The function you can accept an argument called T.

56
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.610
‫The argument contained a number between zero and one, the quantize function was introduced for the

57
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.060
‫specific problem we're facing, it'll allow us to loop through any of the interpellation functions multiple

58
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.810
‫times, depending on how many times the function will run.

59
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.040
‫D3 will provide you with an evenly distributed set of numbers between zero and one.

60
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.840
‫This makes it ideal for the color interpolation functions.

61
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.280
‫We will pass the argument onto the INTERPOLATE function.

62
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.730
‫We can also shorten this function to the interpolate function alone.

63
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.740
‫It'll result in the same thing, the colors variable will be set to an array of colors that have been

64
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.850
‫generated by the quantize function.

65
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.800
‫Perfect.

66
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.400
‫We will pass the colors array on to the range function.

67
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.230
‫Next will use this scale to set the color for the arc, scroll down to where we created the arcs.

68
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.670
‫We will chain and attribute function onto the selection to change the film attribute.

69
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.290
‫The value will be an arrow function where we'll accept the argument.

70
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.530
‫We'll return the following these data name.

71
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.170
‫Keep in mind, the selection is joined to the formatted data, the original data can be found in the

72
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.460
‫data property we're passing on the name, which is where the name of the age group is stored.

73
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.060
‫Let's refresh the page to view the ARC's.

74
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.810
‫Great, each arc has a different color.

75
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.180
‫There's one problem with this pie, but it's not noticeable without labels.

76
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.600
‫In the next lecture will add labels to the ARC's.
