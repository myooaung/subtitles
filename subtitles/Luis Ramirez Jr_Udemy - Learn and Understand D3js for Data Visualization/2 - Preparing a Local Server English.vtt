00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.930
‫In this lecture, we're going to discuss what we'll need for writing data visualizations with these

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.920
‫three to start things off.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.540
‫I want to talk about the text editor will be using for this course.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.050
‫You're free to use any text editor you like as long as it supports Gmail access and JavaScript.

5
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.660
‫These three languages play a significant role in the D three library.

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.100
‫Your editor will need to support them.

7
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.850
‫The editor I recommended is called Visual Studio Code, or VSC for short.

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.440
‫This editor is completely free, supports the languages we'll need and it can be extended with extensions.

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.900
‫I find it to be the easiest editor to work with for D3 three projects.

10
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.510
‫It's the editor I'll be using for this course.

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.300
‫In addition to an editor, you'll need a server.

12
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.590
‫A server is a computer for hosting websites.

13
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.200
‫There are other things that servers can do, but that's what they primarily are for.

14
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.090
‫When we type A, you are in a browser.

15
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.970
‫A request is made from our browser to the server.

16
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.010
‫The service job is to figure out what page the browser wants.

17
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.530
‫It may also respond with images, CSS and JavaScript files.

18
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.860
‫It might sound strange to hear that we need a server to work with these three.

19
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.570
‫Truthfully, we don't.

20
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.090
‫D3 is a client side library.

21
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.670
‫We can run it in the browser without a problem.

22
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.090
‫XML files can be opened directly in a browser.

23
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.410
‫However, there are limitations to opening files directly in the browser.

24
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.080
‫Browsers will disable some of its features.

25
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.330
‫One of the features that get disabled is being able to perform in HTTP request.

26
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.260
‫We won't be able to grab data from an external source and HTML file delivered by a server will allow

27
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.490
‫us to make requests.

28
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.760
‫Therefore, we should have a server for delivering files instead of opening them directly in the browser.

29
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.700
‫There are different ways we can create a server.

30
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.970
‫If you're able to write your own server, then by all means go for it.

31
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.200
‫However, writing a server takes a lot of time.

32
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.380
‫I want to focus on D three as much as possible.

33
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.520
‫Luckily, we won't need to write a server.

34
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.780
‫There are solutions available that can make things so much easier if you're using visual studio code

35
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.120
‫like me, there's an extension available for opening files from a server.

36
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.410
‫If you haven't already download, install and open visual studio code.

37
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.980
‫On the right, there's a menu item called Extension's.

38
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.440
‫This option will allow you to search for extensions on the market, most extensions are free, lets

39
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.170
‫search for an extension called live server.

40
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.840
‫This extension is developed by Ritwik Day.

41
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.240
‫It's a very popular extension because it can start a server with one click.

42
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.040
‫Let's install this extension.

43
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.370
‫After installing this extension, we can start using it right away.

44
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.230
‫First, we'll need to move into a directory where we can write our charts.

45
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.830
‫I've already moved into an empty directory.

46
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.930
‫I recommend you create a directory specifically for your three projects.

47
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.650
‫You can move into a different directory by clicking on file open folder.

48
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.340
‫After moving into an empty directory, create a file called index dot HTML.

49
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.350
‫Inside this file, we can quickly scaffold a template by typing HTML, a list of templates will appear

50
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.960
‫will select the HTML five option.

51
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.520
‫This option will generate a template, most of this should be familiar to you, but there's nothing

52
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.950
‫special about this template.

53
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.480
‫We're going to open this file in the browser.

54
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.900
‫Before we do, let's add some plain text to the body tag to let us know if we opened the correct file.

55
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.320
‫The next thing we need to do is right, click on the index HTML file, this will bring up a menu.

56
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.200
‫One of the options we can select is called Open with live server.

57
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.880
‫Lets click on this option.

58
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.550
‫A new tab in our browser will be opened, will be able to view the contents of the HTML file in our

59
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.130
‫browser.

60
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.770
‫I'm going to quickly open the file directly in the browser to make a comparison.

61
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.760
‫I have two tabs that have the HTML file opened.

62
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.190
‫The difference between them is that one tab has the file opens directly in the browser.

63
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.490
‫The other tab is delivering the file from a server.

64
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.760
‫We can check if a file is being opened directly by looking at the address bar next to the path of the

65
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.800
‫file, the browser will output the word file.

66
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.010
‫This indicates the file is not served from a server in the other tab.

67
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.720
‫The path to the file is completely different.

68
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.410
‫The file is being served from an address called one two seven zero zero one.

69
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.450
‫You may also see localhost.

70
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.830
‫There isn't a difference.

71
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.590
‫The extension we're using will start a server.

72
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.510
‫The server will deliver files from the directory we have opened in our editors.

73
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.320
‫The U.

74
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.130
‫R and we see in the address bar is how we access the files.

75
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.400
‫The browser will know that the server is located on your personal machine just like that, without having

76
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.080
‫to write a single line of code.

77
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.070
‫We have a server.

78
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.880
‫There's a lot more going on behind the scenes, but that doesn't matter.

79
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.770
‫We only care about what's displayed on the browser and that our code works.

80
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.160
‫We'll leave the server side of things to the backend developers.

81
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.950
‫Something I want to highlight is that this will only work for HTML documents.

82
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.550
‫Let me show you what I mean.

83
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.380
‫I'm going to go back to my editor.

84
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.250
‫I'll create a new file called Test Dot James.

85
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.210
‫You don't have to follow along as this is just an example, if I were to right click on this file in

86
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.230
‫the Explorer, the open with live server option is not present.

87
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.620
‫That's because the life server extension will only open HTML files in the browser.

88
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.070
‫That's perfectly fine.

89
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.190
‫We can use HQ email to load script files if we need them.

90
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.090
‫To reiterate, D3 is a client side library.

91
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.900
‫You don't need.

92
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.320
‫A server, however, will be requesting data from external sources, which does require a server or

93
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.870
‫else the browser will throw an error for the rest of this course will be using this extension to view

94
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.460
‫our projects in the browser.

95
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.660
‫That does it for now.

96
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.130
‫I'll see you in the next one.
