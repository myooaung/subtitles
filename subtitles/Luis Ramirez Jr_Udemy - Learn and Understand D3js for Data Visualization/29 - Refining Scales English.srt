00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,150
‫In this lecture, we are going to look at how to refine our scales, we can change the behavior of a

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,440
‫scale by changing additional functions.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,250
‫Let's explore what else we can do with scales.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,720
‫The first function will explore is called nice.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,710
‫There are times where our dataset can contain decimal values.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,330
‫We won't always be dealing with whole numbers.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,990
‫Depending on the type of chart we're drawing, it may not be essential to scale a decimal value.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,750
‫We can tell our skill function to round the domain values.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,730
‫That's what the nice function does.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,930
‫We are going to change the nice function on the Y scale function.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,290
‫The Windscale function is responsible for transforming the temperature if the temperature has a decimal

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,930
‫value.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,280
‫We will rounded to the nearest whole number.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,490
‫We aren't going to apply the nice function to the X scale function.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,530
‫The reason we aren't going to is because the humidity is measured from zero to one.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,920
‫It'll always contain a decimal value.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,240
‫If we were to apply the nice function to the scale, we may get inaccurate scaling.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,020
‫The next function we'll look at is the range round function.

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,950
‫The range round function will round the output range values.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,930
‫We can replace the range functions in both scales with the range round function.

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,150
‫The range round function is different from the nice function, it only applies to the output range,

22
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,920
‫whereas the nice function is applying to the domain, they both will round numeric values.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,320
‫The last function we will look at is the clamp function.

24
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,680
‫We are not limited to scaling values within the domain.

25
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,690
‫If you can recall, we saw an example of what happens if we pass in a value to our scale functions.

26
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,700
‫That is outside the original range.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,700
‫D3 will try its best to scale the value.

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,380
‫The Klamt function will force our scale functions not to transform values outside the range of the output.

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,160
‫This function may be useful for when you're introducing new data if you have new data.

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,280
‫It's possible the data may be outside the range of the original domain.

31
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,660
‫This causes our scale to output a value outside of the range.

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,790
‫If we're using a scale for positioning a shape, the shape may be drawn outside of the containers bounds.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,470
‫The clamp function can prevent that from happening by default.

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,850
‫Clamping is disabled.

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,360
‫We can change the clamp function to turn on clamping.

36
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,420
‫We will change the clamp function to both scales.

37
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,600
‫We need to pass in a boolean value, we will pass in true.

38
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,550
‫Let's refresh the page.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,610
‫These scatterplot is displaying normally it doesn't look like anything is happening.

40
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,180
‫However, if we view the circles and the developer tools, the values are slightly different.

41
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,380
‫Thanks to the nice and range round functions, the values for the coordinates are whole numbers.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,070
‫Here's what the values initially looked like.

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,370
‫There are a lot of decimal values for each coordinate.

44
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,600
‫It can make it harder to debug because of how much information is presented.

45
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,800
‫I recommend rounding the values whenever possible.

46
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,390
‫However, you do want to be careful.

47
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,970
‫If you're working with data that is measured to a specific decimal value, you may not want to round

48
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,690
‫values.

49
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,930
‫It depends entirely on what you're trying to accomplish.

50
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,980
‫In our case, rounding the values makes sense since the impact is small in the next lecture will continue

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,210
‫with our scatterplot.
