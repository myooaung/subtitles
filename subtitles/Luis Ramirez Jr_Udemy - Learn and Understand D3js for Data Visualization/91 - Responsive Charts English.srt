‫In this lecture, we're going to talk about responsiveness, responsiveness is the idea of a website

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,820
‫rendering differently for different screen resolutions.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,520
‫A site will appear differently on a desktop than it does on a smartphone.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,190
‫We haven't had the opportunity to discuss how we would make a responsive.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,280
‫There are dozens of solutions at our disposal.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,420
‫In the old days, we would use JavaScript to detect if the window has been resized.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,530
‫If it has, we will redraw the chart based on the current dimensions of the window.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,270
‫Luckily, the Web has evolved to the point where we don't need to use a convoluted solution.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,800
‫So far we've done the following.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,540
‫When drawing an SPG image, we added the width and height attributes.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,340
‫Unfortunately, we can't set either attribute to a percentage value.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,740
‫We need to use VSS if we want to set the width of the attributes to a percentage.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,740
‫However, there's another solution we can take.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,880
‫Instead of setting the width and height attributes, we can add an attribute called view box.

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,830
‫This attribute allows us to configure the coordinate system.

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,300
‫There are four numbers we can pass into this attribute.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,560
‫The first two numbers are the starting coordinate for every shape by default.

18
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,680
‫This is set to zero zero.

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,260
‫If you'd like to set the starting coordinate to something different, you can change these two numbers.

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,990
‫The first number is for the X coordinate.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,660
‫The second number is for the Y coordinate.

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,890
‫Ninety nine percent of the time you want to leave it at zero zero.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,100
‫The next two numbers are the dimensions of the chart.

24
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,360
‫The values allow us to specify the aspect ratio of the chart.

25
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,540
‫Typically, you should use the original values you would have used for the width and height attributes.

26
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,880
‫After configuring this attribute, you're set just one line of code and you're done.

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,220
‫And this lecture's resource section, I provide a link to an article that dives into how the view box

28
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,580
‫attribute works and SFG, there's a lot of great information here which can give you a better understanding

29
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,220
‫of how SFG resize sizes everything.

30
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,280
‫For the most part, you don't have to do anything crazy to get responsiveness out of your charts.

31
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:23,240
‫The only values you'll ever change are the third and fourth values inside the view box attribute.
