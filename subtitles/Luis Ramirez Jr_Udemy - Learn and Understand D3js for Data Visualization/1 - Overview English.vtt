00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.090
‫Hello and welcome to the three course, this is the most comprehensive course on three rounds, by the

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.350
‫end of this course you will have a solid understanding of D3 and its features.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.700
‫D three is a JavaScript library for drawing data visualizations.

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.480
‫Now more than ever, data is being collected in vast amounts.

5
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.180
‫By itself, data is difficult to understand.

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.030
‫We need a way to make it readable.

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.640
‫This is where D3 comes into play.

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.080
‫D3 can assist you with drawing charts based on data.

9
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.690
‫This course will explore most of what D three has to offer.

10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.540
‫Here's what you can expect to learn from this course.

11
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.760
‫Currently you're in Section one.

12
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.140
‫This section goes over some topics you'll need to know before starting the course.

13
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.900
‫It's crucial that we're all on the same page.

14
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.080
‫We'll even talk about what data visualization is.

15
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.060
‫I want to make one thing clear.

16
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.270
‫This course is not about design or data science.

17
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.320
‫The core focus of this course is D3 and the code behind three data science and design principles are

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.420
‫topics that deserve a course of their own.

19
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.960
‫In this course, we will be focusing solely on the code.

20
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.580
‫With that being said, you are expected to know the basics of HTML success and JavaScript in Section

21
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.520
‫two, we'll discuss the fundamentals of SVG.

22
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.310
‫D3 is commonly used with SVG.

23
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.220
‫If you're not familiar with SVG, that's fine.

24
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.630
‫We'll learn about some of the most basic shapes that can be drawn with SVG.

25
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.780
‫This section will give you enough knowledge of SVG to work with D three in section three.

26
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.580
‫We'll get started with D three.

27
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.880
‫We're not going to focus on any type of visualization.

28
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.320
‫Instead, the focus will be on how we can make selections with D3.

29
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.170
‫Selections are a core concept of three.

30
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.650
‫They're a commonly used object for any visualization.

31
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.890
‫After becoming familiar with selections, we'll discuss other topics such as joining data and performing

32
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:04.030
‫AIG-FP requests in Section four will start jumping into drawing real world charts with these three,

33
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.800
‫we'll be working with real data.

34
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.550
‫Throughout most of this course, the first type of data will draw our scatter plots.

35
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:17.170
‫This project will allow us to explore things such as drawing an image, using scales to transform data

36
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.670
‫and drawing axes.

37
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.610
‫In Section five, we'll look at different scales, scales or functions for transforming data.

38
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.820
‫It's important to understand what each scale does.

39
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.690
‫This way, you can select the best scale suitable for the job.

40
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.130
‫In Section six, we'll look at animations and interactions.

41
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.310
‫Animations can enhance your data visualization.

42
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.250
‫D3 comes with a solution out of the box for animating different properties and attributes.

43
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.270
‫We can also handle events for detecting mouse clicks or hovers.

44
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.200
‫In Section seven, we're going to draw three more charts.

45
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.490
‫We'll draw a line chart, pie chart and a stacked bar chart.

46
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.850
‫While the process will be similar from chart to charts will encounter challenges along the way.

47
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.360
‫That's unique to each chart.

48
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.630
‫I'll discuss what those challenges are in this section.

49
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.200
‫Lastly, in Section eight, I go over some topics I may have missed, such as responsive design.

50
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.700
‫In this day and age, your charts must be responsive for any device.

51
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.700
‫There's a lot of information to go over in this course.

52
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.800
‫You will definitely be kept busy.

53
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.410
‫Let's talk about requirements now.

54
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.090
‫This course assumes, you know, HTML access and JavaScript.

55
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.990
‫We won't need to write HTML and access to opt in.

56
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.890
‫D3 is primarily written in JavaScript.

57
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.260
‫It's important you have a basic understanding of JavaScript.

58
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.980
‫This includes variables, functions, conditional statements, arrays and objects will be using the

59
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.130
‫latest syntax features of JavaScript in this course.

60
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.970
‫Lastly, you'll need a server and editor of your choice.

61
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.610
‫If you don't have either of those, don't worry.

62
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.360
‫And the next lecture will talk about EDS and servers.

63
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.180
‫Feel free to use any editor as long as it supports HTML access and JavaScript.

64
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.080
‫You're good to go.

65
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.490
‫If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the Q&A section.

66
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.150
‫I'm here to answer any questions about topics that are unclear.

67
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.000
‫I usually respond within twenty four hours.

68
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.560
‫In addition, I encourage you to help other students with questions they have.

69
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.070
‫It'll help enforce the knowledge you've gained throughout this course.

70
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.290
‫I can't wait to see you in the course.

71
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.960
‫Let's get started with data visualization.
