00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,560
‫In this section, we explored various skills for drawing charts, every skill has its use, we encountered

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,170
‫scenarios that required a different scale.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,830
‫What might work for one chart might not work for another.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,960
‫It's always good to experiment with various scales.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,090
‫One of the main takeaways for this section is the difference between continuous and discrete data.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,740
‫By knowing what type of data you're working with, you can narrow down the choices of what skills to

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,280
‫use.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,280
‫The number of viable scales can be whittled down.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,520
‫If you know you need discrete or continuous data by understanding these two words, you won't have a

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,550
‫hard time learning new scales.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,980
‫We didn't have the opportunity to explore every scale.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,510
‫There are so many more scales available.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,930
‫This section was meant to introduce you to some of the skills and help you understand why there are

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,920
‫different scales.

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,190
‫We will be exploring other skills throughout the course.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,420
‫Don't worry, you will get plenty of chances to try other scales.

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,270
‫Until then, I will see you in the next section.
