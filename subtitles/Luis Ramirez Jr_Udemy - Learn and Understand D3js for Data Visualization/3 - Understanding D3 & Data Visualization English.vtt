00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.950
‫In this lecture, we're going to discuss what data visualization is and why it's important before we

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.460
‫write a single line of code.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.100
‫I want to make sure we're all on the same page.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.730
‫The main focus of this course is D three.

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.210
‫We're going to learn how to draw charts with JavaScript.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.190
‫Data visualization is a topic that deserves a course of its own.

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.990
‫Despite that, I want to present some fundamental concepts that you should always keep in mind when

8
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.100
‫creating charts.

9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.790
‫It'll help you better approach your projects.

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.460
‫So the question is, what is data visualization?

11
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.760
‫Data visualization is the ability to convey a story or an idea as efficiently as possible.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.690
‫As the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words.

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.920
‫Data visualizations are so much more than just pretty graphics.

14
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.280
‫We can use graphs to tell stories to our readers.

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.520
‫As a result, the data visualization should allow the reader to make an informative decision or learn

16
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.270
‫something new.

17
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.140
‫Data visualizations can help us explore patterns.

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.240
‫It's challenging to visualize patterns by looking at a spreadsheet or table of data.

19
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.750
‫Without a proper visualization, it can be easy to miss small disruptions in our data that can lead

20
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.820
‫to making inefficient decisions.

21
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.450
‫If we were to break down most visualizations, we would find that visualizations are made up of shapes,

22
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.040
‫colors and sizes.

23
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.480
‫With these three building blocks, we give the user insight into the data.

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.650
‫Their viewing charts make a massive impact on how we view the world.

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.320
‫Readers should be able to understand how to read a chart with little to no help.

26
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.240
‫So now that we understand what data visualization is, let's explore what makes a good visualization.

27
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.010
‫Here are five tips for making a great visualization.

28
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.580
‫First, before you write a single line of code, it's important to understand the context of the data

29
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.600
‫visualization.

30
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.600
‫You need to ask yourself the following questions.

31
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.100
‫Who is the audience?

32
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.420
‫What do they need to know?

33
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.550
‫What do they need to do with the data?

34
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.290
‫It's important you answer these questions before you start writing a line of code.

35
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.030
‫Tip number two, we need to choose an appropriate visualisations, this can be considered the next step

36
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.820
‫after you've answered the questions in the previous tip, you can only select a visual after you know

37
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.200
‫who your audience is.

38
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.680
‫Different charts are good at conveying different sizes of data.

39
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.300
‫Some charts are good at displaying small sets of data in comparison.

40
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.070
‫Others are good at displaying large sets of data.

41
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.330
‫If we were to use a visual that has difficulty displaying too much data.

42
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.060
‫This could confuse the reader.

43
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.330
‫The next tip for creating a good visualization is removing clutter or unnecessary information.

44
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.900
‫Data can come in all shapes and sizes.

45
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.310
‫It's possible the data you're working with may come with unnecessary information.

46
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.660
‫Our job is to select the information that's most important for the reader.

47
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.360
‫We don't want to show information to the reader that won't help them.

48
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.320
‫This problem tends to be common in maps.

49
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.200
‫Cities and towns tend to be close to each other, but you don't need to draw every single one of them.

50
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.940
‫If you did, your map might become cluttered from a distance.

51
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.650
‫Most maps will display the major cities unless the reader zooms in on the map.

52
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.320
‫The main point I want to make is that it's important to decide beforehand what data should be visualized.

53
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.690
‫If you're presenting an overwhelming amount of data, the reader may not be able to focus on what's

54
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.320
‫important.

55
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.460
‫We should carefully choose what data to prioritize visually.

56
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.830
‫This leads me to tip number four.

57
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.700
‫Draw attention using shape, size and color.

58
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.040
‫Not all pieces of data are equal.

59
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.680
‫If you have something that the user should primarily focus on, don't be afraid to make it larger.

60
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.220
‫Important data should stand out from everything else.

61
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.770
‫It's a straightforward tip, but it's a common mistake for beginner developers not to make their data

62
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.550
‫stand out.

63
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.660
‫Tip number five is to make sure your data tells a story.

64
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.300
‫This is something you'll learn through experience and by studying other data visualizations.

65
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.760
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a blog post by Google.

66
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.450
‫It describes the importance of telling a story with data.

67
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.320
‫At the beginning of this article, there's a quote that summarizes why we should tell a story with our

68
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.640
‫data, it really resonates with me.

69
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.050
‫Let's read it together.

70
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.570
‫Most organizations recognize that being a successful, data driven company requires skilled developers

71
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.650
‫and analysts fewer grasp how to use data to tell a meaningful story that resonates both intellectually

72
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.600
‫and emotionally with an audience.

73
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.330
‫Marketers are responsible for this story.

74
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.180
‫As such, they're often the bridge between the data and those who need to learn something from it or

75
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.620
‫make decisions based on its analysis.

76
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.990
‫As marketers, we can tailor the story to the audience and effectively use data visualization to complement

77
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.780
‫our narrative.

78
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.490
‫We know that data is powerful, but with a good story.

79
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.590
‫It's unforgettable.

80
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.960
‫I highly recommend reading the rest of the article.

81
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.790
‫So we've gone over what data visualization is.

82
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.920
‫Let's talk about how D3 plays into all of this.

83
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:32.110
‫D3 stands for data driven documents, I would say that's a great description of what D3 does, D3 helps

84
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.380
‫you close the gap between the data and the visualization.

85
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.920
‫Creating a visualization requires some work.

86
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.410
‫We need to calculate things such as size, position, color, text, etc..

87
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.570
‫This becomes increasingly difficult once you introduce interactivity to your graphs.

88
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.530
‫D3 assists you by providing a set of functions for displaying your data onto the document, the document

89
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.670
‫being the Web page.

90
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.810
‫The reader views on their browser D3 is designed to make the process of drawing a graph easier.

91
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.350
‫There are two pieces that we need to connect to make a visualization.

92
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.410
‫There's the data and then there's the document.

93
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.230
‫The data is what drives the visualization.

94
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.480
‫It should never be the other way around.

95
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.480
‫Your visualization should represent the data.

96
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.030
‫No matter what it looks like or how it's structured.

97
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.860
‫The visualization should not be able to control how the data changes.

98
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.850
‫For example, let's say you had excess white space in your graph.

99
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.610
‫That doesn't mean the data needs to be adjusted.

100
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.450
‫Instead, the graph needs to be adjusted, not the data.

101
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.960
‫Before I finish this lecture, let's explore some examples of good and bad visualizations.

102
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.380
‫Let's start with an example of a bad example.

103
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.640
‫Here's a pie chart.

104
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.540
‫It shows the distribution of gold among various countries.

105
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.380
‫As you can tell, it doesn't provide much information visually.

106
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.220
‫It's hard to figure out which slice belongs to which country.

107
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.010
‫We're not told how much gold the country holds.

108
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.180
‫There isn't a label to help us to understand anything about this graph.

109
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.060
‫Overall, it's a terrible visualization.

110
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.320
‫Let's explore some examples of great visualizations in this lecture's resource section, I provide a

111
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.080
‫link to a blog post about the repetitiveness in pop lyrics.

112
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.360
‫This post is filled with imagery and examples.

113
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.680
‫The color choice is fantastic.

114
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.360
‫The reader is slowly introduced to the data and it's organized very well.

115
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.780
‫Graphs like this can be created with three.

116
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.350
‫Hopefully you're excited to get started with these three.

117
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.470
‫By the end of this course, you'll be able to create beautiful graphs with animations and interactivity

118
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.970
‫similar to this example.

119
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.880
‫When you're ready, I'll see you in the next lecture.
