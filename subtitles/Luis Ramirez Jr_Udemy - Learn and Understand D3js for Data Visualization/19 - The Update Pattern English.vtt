00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.240
‫In this lecture, we were going to look at the update pattern, it's a pattern that is deprecated.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.000
‫It's no longer encouraged that developers use the update pattern.

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.890
‫Despite that, it's still something we should learn about.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.440
‫There are a lot of examples online on how to build graphs with the three.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.070
‫Most of them are outdated.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.250
‫However, they can still be useful.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.030
‫It's very likely that older examples are using the update pattern.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.010
‫By learning the update pattern, you will be able to learn from the examples and apply them to your

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.090
‫current situation.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.780
‫The update pattern still works in version six of the three.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.040
‫We won't have any problem using it.

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.290
‫So what is the update pattern?

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.740
‫It's an alternative solution for working with the enter update and exit selections.

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.330
‫Before the join method, we had to work with each selection independently.

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.970
‫Three selections need to be updated.

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.700
‫The first selection that should be updated is the update selection.

17
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.880
‫This is followed by the enter and exit selections.

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.140
‫Let's explore how the pattern works.

19
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.000
‫We will continue working in the same code base, since we are going to be using the update pattern,

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.840
‫we can comment.

21
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.530
‫I'll be joined method completely.

22
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.000
‫Without doing anything else, we've completed the first step of the update pattern, the update pattern

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.420
‫dictates we should update the current selection after the data has been joined up above.

24
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.330
‫We are calling the data method, whatever we call the data method.

25
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.860
‫The update pattern begins after calling this method.

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.020
‫We are updating the list items to display the numbers.

27
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.420
‫Let's view the page in the browser.

28
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.970
‫The current selection is displaying the first two numbers.

29
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.790
‫This is what we can call our update selection.

30
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.810
‫We can move on to the entry and exit selections, switched back to the ED.

31
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.950
‫On a new line, we're going to call the Internet method on the element variable.

32
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.480
‫Every selection object has a method called enter the entry method will return the enter selection,

33
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.040
‫we can begin the process of adding elements to the document.

34
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.760
‫It's going to be similar to what we did in the enter function for the join method.

35
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.830
‫One important thing to note is that the enter and exit selections are only available after calling the

36
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.640
‫data method.

37
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.560
‫The data method is what will create these selections for us.

38
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.970
‫We will chain the append method.

39
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.540
‫The name of the element we will add is called list item.

40
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.890
‫We don't want the list item to be empty, we want it to display the number that is joined to the element,

41
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.060
‫we can use the text transformation method to insert new text.

42
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.090
‫We will pass in an arrow function where we will be passed in the data joint to the element in the function

43
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.190
‫and we will return the data parameter.

44
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.930
‫We are finished with the entrance election, the entry method does not a pending new element for you,

45
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.050
‫it returns the enter selection.

46
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.480
‫From there, you are required to add the element yourself.

47
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.740
‫That's one of the main differences between the entry method and join method.

48
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.710
‫The join method can handle adding new elements for you based on the enter selection.

49
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.110
‫The process is much more abstract.

50
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.700
‫The same goes for the exit selection below the enter selection.

51
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.650
‫We will call the exit method on the element variable.

52
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.950
‫This method will return the exit selection after returning the selection, we are responsible for what

53
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.880
‫happens next.

54
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.040
‫The exit selection contains a list of elements that should be removed.

55
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.410
‫We can remove the elements by calling be remove method.

56
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.760
‫We're finished.

57
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.140
‫This is the update pattern, the overall idea is the same, the joint method is capable of updating

58
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.840
‫the current enter and exit selections with the update pattern.

59
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.610
‫We need to take care of every step of the process.

60
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.380
‫It's a lot more code to write.

61
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.130
‫The joint method was introduced to make this process simpler.

62
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.090
‫At the same time, the joint method can be customized for any of these selections.

63
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.570
‫Let's switch to the browser one more time.

64
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.190
‫The list items are being rendered without a problem, the update pattern is powerful, but it's the

65
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.590
‫old way of doing things.

66
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.330
‫The joint method is the preferred way to go.

67
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.410
‫For the rest of this course, we will be using the joint method unless you state otherwise.

68
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.980
‫The reason I showed you the UPD pattern is because there are many examples online that still use the

69
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.780
‫update pattern.

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.110
‫Understanding how this pattern works will allow you to learn from those examples.
