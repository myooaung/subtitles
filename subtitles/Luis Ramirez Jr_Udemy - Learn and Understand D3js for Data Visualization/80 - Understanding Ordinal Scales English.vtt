00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.450
‫In this lecture, we're going to paint each arc a unique color in the past few projects, we've been

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.820
‫assigning custom colors to our images.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.150
‫However, that's not going to cut it for this project.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.000
‫Regardless of how many groups or arcs we have in our pie, each arc should have a unique color.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.590
‫We also want our chart to be scalable.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.690
‫Let's say we had more age groups in our data.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.370
‫We would need to generate a new color for each additional group.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.330
‫One option would be to add a color manually.

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.420
‫However, that's not scalable.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.020
‫It would be better if our chart could generate a new color for each age group.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.470
‫If we had to add more groups, we should generate random colors automatically to help us with adding

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.110
‫colors.

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.040
‫We're going to use what's called an ordinal scale.

14
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.750
‫It's one of the most commonly used scales.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.150
‫Let's talk about what an ordinal scale is before jumping into the code.

16
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.900
‫And ordinal scale will transform discrete data into discrete data.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.390
‫We have to ask ourselves when we really want to do this type of transformation.

18
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.900
‫Throughout most of this course, we've been transforming values such as temperatures, distance population

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.310
‫and other types of data.

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.410
‫Do you know what they have in common?

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.330
‫Their numbers?

22
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.080
‫It can be easy to transform numbers into other numbers or even colors.

23
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.890
‫However, they will be times where you'll want to transform things, for example, the months in a year.

24
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.100
‫Or how about the names of people or locations?

25
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.890
‫You may want to transform these things into numbers or colors.

26
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.810
‫That's where the ordinal scale comes into play.

27
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.300
‫It's able to transform things into values that you can use for drawing a chart.

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.320
‫Let's look at an example.

29
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.540
‫I'm sure you've taken surveys before.

30
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.010
‫It's common for surveys to give readers the following options strongly.

31
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.320
‫Disagree, disagree, neutral.

32
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.920
‫I agree.

33
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.210
‫Strongly agree.

34
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.610
‫We may want to draw these options onto a chart by transforming them into colors.

35
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.720
‫We can use a dark shade of red for the strongly disagree option.

36
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.220
‫As for the strongly agree option, we can use a dark shade of green.

37
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.270
‫Then we can use everything in between for the other options.

38
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.050
‫And ordinal scale can help us with this transformation.

39
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.530
‫We can assign colors to each option.

40
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.930
‫One thing worth noting is how many options there are.

41
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.980
‫There are a total of five possible options.

42
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.940
‫This makes the data discrete.

43
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.440
‫The same can be said about the values we're transforming the data into.

44
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.910
‫The colors are considered discrete because there are only five colors.

45
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.730
‫Each option is assigned to one color.

46
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.730
‫Another thing worth noting is the order.

47
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.260
‫The order does matter.

48
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.140
‫The first option is assigned to the first color.

49
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.850
‫The second option is assigned to the second color, so on and so forth.

50
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.400
‫Hence why it's called an ordinal scale.

51
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.060
‫It's a scale that transforms a category of data into values based on the order we're going to be using

52
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.320
‫an ordinal scale to help us transform our age groups into colors.

53
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.710
‫We'll start writing an ordinal scale in the next lecture.
