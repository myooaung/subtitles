00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,060
‫In this lecture, we are going to learn about a scale called the quantize scale sounds scary, but I

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,060
‫promise you it isn't.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,310
‫Let's talk about the problem we faced in their previous lecture.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,910
‫We needed to transform our values into colors.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,000
‫We used the linear scale to accomplish this.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,000
‫The linear scale will transform the data set from a continuous data set to another continuous data set.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,450
‫In our case, the output will be a continuous data set of colors.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,700
‫While it's great that these three could handle this without a problem, it was difficult to read the

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,150
‫data.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,030
‫We had one hundred different colors on the chart.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,760
‫Rather than having one hundred different colors, we should limit how many colors can be used.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,440
‫In other words, we should transform the data into a discrete data set.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,260
‫As a reminder, data that is discrete means there are a limited number of choices.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,090
‫We should be able to count how many values are in a data set if it's discrete.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,170
‫The quanti scale is a scale that can transform continuous data into discrete data.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,970
‫It's the solution that can solve our dilemma.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,510
‫Before using the quanti scale, we should figure out what colors we want to transform our data set to.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,840
‫Unlike last time, we need to provide every possible color the data can be transformed to.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,330
‫We are going to use three colors.

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,060
‫They will be white, pink and red.

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,190
‫We're going to be using three colors because of how income is categorized in America.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,780
‫Typically your income will determine which economic class you're replacing.

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,870
‫Thirsty, lower middle and upper class.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,060
‫There are three classes in total.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,710
‫Therefore we will have three colors, one color for each class.

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,380
‫I want to answer the following question.

27
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,570
‫How does the quanti scale work?

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,490
‫Like any other scale, we need to provide the input domain and output range.

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,010
‫The input domain the scale is expecting are the lowest and highest values in our data set.

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,500
‫In our case, this would be zero and three hundred thousand five hundred and seventy seven.

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,210
‫Next, the scale needs to know how many values will be in the range.

32
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,130
‫We are going to have three colors, therefore we will have three buckets.

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,120
‫The word bucket is a word you will come across in the documentation.

34
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,900
‫It's used to describe a value in the output range.

35
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,710
‫It's called a bucket because a value in the output range can represent multiple input domains values.

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,230
‫The quanti scale will attempt to divide the input domain into equal intervals.

37
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,920
‫What exactly does that mean?

38
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,310
‫Let me explain with an example.

39
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,330
‫The first color in the output range will be white.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,730
‫White will be used to represent the lower class.

41
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,760
‫A value will be transformed into white.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,670
‫If it falls between zero and one hundred thousand one hundred and ninety two, it's one third of the

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,600
‫input domain.

44
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,840
‫The color pink will represent the middle class.

45
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,540
‫It's also one third of the input domain.

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,080
‫A value will be transformed into pink if it falls between one hundred thousand one hundred and ninety

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,010
‫two and two one hundred thousand three hundred and eighty five.

48
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,490
‫The last color in the output range will be red.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,610
‫This color will represent the upper class.

50
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,910
‫A value will be transformed into red if it falls between two hundred thousand three hundred and eighty

51
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,690
‫five and three hundred thousand five hundred and seventy seven.

52
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,450
‫Hopefully you get the idea of how the quanti scale will transform data.

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,090
‫It's dividing the range of the input domain by the number of values in the output range.

54
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,690
‫It'll attempt its best to make each interval equal.

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,020
‫In the end, any value we pass into the scale would result in one of the three colors.

56
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,520
‫Let's look at another example of how the quantize scale can work.

57
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,330
‫This time we have a data set that's easier to divide.

58
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,000
‫Let's pretend our data sets lowest and highest numbers are zero and nine hundred thousand.

59
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,290
‫Once again, we have three buckets, one for each color.

60
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,890
‫A value will be transformed into white if it falls between zero and three, one hundred thousand pink

61
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,830
‫if it falls in between three hundred thousand six hundred thousand.

62
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,460
‫Lastly, red if it's above six hundred thousand, hopefully this is much clearer.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,700
‫Enough theory, let's begin using the quanti scale, we will start by creating another container for

64
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,140
‫the image in the HTML file.

65
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,390
‫We are going to create a copy of the H1 and div tags.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,570
‫And the H1 tags, we will update the text to say quanti scale.

67
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,900
‫The ID for the div tag will be updated to heat map to.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,410
‫The second chart will contain an image where the boxes are colored with the quanti scale, this will

69
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,060
‫allow us to compare it with the linear scale.

70
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,590
‫Let's switch over to the app file.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,040
‫We can reuse the draw function for drawing the chart below in the script.

72
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,160
‫We are going to call the draw function again the selector for the element to draw.

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,050
‫The element is hash heat.

74
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,800
‫Map to.

75
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:28,170
‫We will also need to tell the draw function what scale to use, we will pass in quantize as the second

76
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,860
‫argument.

77
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,640
‫Let's update the draw function to use the quanti scale, we are going to update the condition block

78
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:44,840
‫we created, we will add and else if block this time, the condition will check if the scale argument

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,520
‫is equal to quantize.

80
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,980
‫Inside this block, we will assign the color scale variable to the D 3.0 scale quantize function.

81
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:05,260
‫Next, we will need to provide the domain, the quantize scale requires the lowest and highest numbers

82
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,240
‫in our data set.

83
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,610
‫We will change the domain function to set the domain.

84
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,260
‫We will pass in the three dot extent function with the data set.

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,900
‫Afterward, we need to provide the output range.

86
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,870
‫We will change the range function.

87
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,830
‫Unlike before, where we provided the lowest and highest possible values, we need to provide an array

88
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,790
‫of possible values, keep in mind, the data will be transformed into a discrete asset.

89
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,540
‫We need to tell D3 the colors we want to transform our data to.

90
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,510
‫We are going to list three colors in the array.

91
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,060
‫They will be white, pink and red.

92
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,560
‫The scale is ready, let's refresh the page to see what we get.

93
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,790
‫The heat map is entirely different from the first heat map, it's evident as to how we can read the

94
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,260
‫data.

95
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,630
‫There's an overwhelming amount of people in the lower class.

96
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,370
‫The middle class follows them.

97
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,620
‫And lastly, the upper class.

98
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,010
‫It's much easier to understand this heat map than the heat map drawn with the linear scale.

99
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,890
‫Now, we have to ask ourselves, is this really the scale we want to use?

100
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,810
‫Let's explore other scales for performing a similar task.

101
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,570
‫After we've explored our options, we will discuss which scale is more suitable and why.

102
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,910
‫We will continue in the next lecture.
