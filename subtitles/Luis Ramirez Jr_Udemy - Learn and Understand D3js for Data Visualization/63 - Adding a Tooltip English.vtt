00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.850
‫In this lecture, we're going to end interactions to our scatterplot, we created a scatterplot in an

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.180
‫earlier section, bring back that code.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.530
‫You can also download the completed code at the end of Section four of this course, if you lost it,

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.290
‫the scatterplot is displaying hundreds of dots.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.630
‫It can be difficult to read each dot.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.100
‫We can use tool tips to improve the user experience.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.160
‫We briefly talked about how to listen for events at the start of this.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.530
‫Section three provides an API to listen for events on our selections.

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.570
‫All browser events are supported.

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.320
‫D three.

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.350
‫We are going to use D threes event system to add a tooltip to our scatterplot tool tips.

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.360
‫Give additional information about a shape.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.250
‫They are completely voluntary.

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.040
‫We don't want to show a tooltip unless a reader is hovering their mouse over a dot.

15
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.730
‫We will use an event to help us detect when the mouse is hovering over a dot.

16
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.470
‫First things first.

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.260
‫We're going to add an element for displaying the tooltip.

18
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.210
‫We can accomplish this task with SVG.

19
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.220
‫Alternatively, we can use regular HTML elements.

20
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.190
‫Throughout most of this course we've been seeking to SVG shapes, but it's perfectly acceptable to use

21
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.960
‫regular HTML elements.

22
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.610
‫Creating tool tips with SVG shapes is excessive in this situation.

23
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.710
‫If we think about it, a tool tip is made up of a rectangle shape with text inside it.

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.460
‫We can accomplish this sort of feature easily with HTML.

25
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.300
‫It's because text is automatically positioned inside an element, whereas with SVG we need to set the

26
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.150
‫position of a text element with coordinates.

27
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.280
‫SVG is a little more complex when it comes to positioning and changing values.

28
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.130
‫It's so much easier to perform this kind of task with just plain HTML access.

29
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.800
‫This is something important to understand.

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.110
‫Not everything has to be SVG.

31
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
‫There are some situations where regular HTML is more than suitable.

32
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.020
‫Most of the time you can use regular HTML for UI elements.

33
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.870
‫Another benefit of using regular HTML is not having to worry about an element being cut off.

34
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.360
‫This makes it perfect for tool tips.

35
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.040
‫They tool tip won't get cut off if it appears outside the bounds of an image.

36
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.050
‫All right, let's get started.

37
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.770
‫First, we have to set up the HTML in the document.

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.190
‫We're going to add a div tag inside the chart element.

39
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.740
‫It'll have an ID of tooltip.

40
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.080
‫We have the option of generating this element dynamically, however, there isn't a reason to do so.

41
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.490
‫The element for the tooltip is going to be complex.

42
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.290
‫Trying to create the structure with D3 would be overkill.

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.460
‫Let's add the structure of our elements inside this element.

44
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.720
‫We're going to add three div tags.

45
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.380
‫The first pair of div tags will have a class called Metric Date.

46
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.010
‫This tank will hold the date of the dot.

47
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.130
‫The reader is hovering over, the second pair will have a class of Metrick humidity.

48
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.600
‫This tag will hold the humidity value, the last pair will have a class of Metrick temperature.

49
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.560
‫This tag will hold the temperature value, we should let the reader know which values they're reading

50
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.330
‫in the second pair of div tags will add the following humidity spane.

51
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.450
‫In the third pair will add the following temperatures fan.

52
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.130
‫The classes and ads I'm introducing have two purposes, these styles for these elements can be found

53
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.250
‫in these style CSFs file.

54
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.350
‫We need to apply these classes if we want the tooltip to look visually appealing.

55
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.330
‫They're also going to help us select the elements when we need to select them in three.

56
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.010
‫Let's check out the styles for a moment.

57
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.440
‫The tooltip element has absolute positioning or going to be using absolute positioning because it's

58
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.620
‫similar to how S.V. GPS coordinates system works.

59
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.440
‫That's perfect because we'll be able to use our skills to position the tooltip above the dot the reader

60
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.420
‫is hovering over.

61
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.520
‫Other than that, everything else is standard stuff.

62
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.500
‫The HTML is ready.

63
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.220
‫Let's refresh the page in the browser to check out the tooltip.

64
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.170
‫The tooltip will be hidden because its display property will be set to none.

65
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.240
‫We can temporarily toggle the display property by using the developer tools.

66
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.120
‫Here's what the tooltip will look like when we display it by default, we're hiding the tooltip because

67
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.350
‫we don't want to show the tooltip unless the mouse is hovered over a dotts.

68
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.120
‫Keep in mind, tool tips are additional information that is useful for reading the chart, but not necessary.

69
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.530
‫We want to make it optional to view the tooltip in the next lecture.

70
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.050
‫We're going to begin the process of making the tooltip functional.
