00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,980
‫In this lecture, we're going to talk about the packages that make up D3, it's important to understand

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,680
‫how D3 is structured.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,190
‫It'll help you find documentation for specific features of D3.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,600
‫Currently, I'm on the GitHub repository page for three.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,410
‫At the top of the page, there's a link to the author of D3.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,410
‫This link will take us to a page of packages maintained under this author, if we were to scroll around,

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,030
‫we'll find dozens of packages, including the original D three package.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,830
‫A lot of the packages start with the word D three, followed by another name.

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,850
‫It'll even tell us when the last update occurred for each package.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,500
‫So what's the deal?

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,080
‫Why are there so many packages related to D3, what do they all mean?

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,040
‫That's what I want to quickly answer in this video.

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,490
‫D3 is an incredibly large package.

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,760
‫The file sizes over five hundred kilobytes, the minified version of D3 is half that size.

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,160
‫The minified version is still large.

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,780
‫The reason for D3 is enormous size is because it comes packed with features for creating various charts.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,610
‫While it's great that D3 can cover almost any scenario.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,470
‫It's very likely that we won't need every feature out of the box.

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,310
‫When D3 was first introduced into the world, it was a basic library for dealing with SVG images.

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,440
‫As it grew, the file size became alarmingly large.

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,140
‫The maintainers of D3 three didn't want to force the community to download the entire package, so they

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,400
‫come up with a solution.

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,360
‫They broke D three down into several smaller packages.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,850
‫Each package focuses on one specific feature set of D three.

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,340
‫This makes D three a modular library.

26
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,880
‫What that means is that we can pick and choose what we want.

27
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,710
‫The version of D three we installed will contain every feature available.

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,740
‫There are several packages that make up D3.

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:12,370
‫You can find a list of packages here, let's go back to the D3 repository page for a moment.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,380
‫On this page, you won't find the documentation for a specific feature, if we scroll around the page,

31
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,850
‫we won't find much info about D3.

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,610
‫Instead, we'll be told about how to install the package.

33
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,710
‫That's about it.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,310
‫If we want to view the documentation for a specific feature, we'll need to click on the API reference

35
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,680
‫link on this documentation page.

36
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,670
‫This link will take us to a page with the list of all the packages, let's click on the Colors package.

37
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,920
‫Will be taken to a section on the page with a brief summary of what's available under this package,

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,100
‫if we want more info, we can click on the heading.

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,180
‫This link will take us to the package where we can find everything we ever want to know about that package.

40
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,810
‫It's important to understand this structure.

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,350
‫You'll most likely want to refer to the documentation.

42
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,910
‫Knowing where to find the documentation for a function will help you a lot.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,650
‫You won't find it under the full D three package.

44
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,260
‫Instead, you will need to navigate to the specific package that contains the code you'll need throughout

45
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,090
‫this course will be using the full version of D three whenever possible.

46
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,840
‫I will provide a link to where you can find more information about a specific feature we're using.

47
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,010
‫Don't worry, I'll take the time to explain how each package works.

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,350
‫One less thing if you would like to install a package independently, there's a section called Installing

49
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,030
‫on each packages page.

50
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,640
‫This section is available on all packages, it'll go over how you can install a package separately,

51
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,250
‫I recommend following these steps if you plan on publishing the charts we build in this course, that

52
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,780
‫wraps it up for this lecture.

53
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,630
‫In the next lecture will begin writing code.
