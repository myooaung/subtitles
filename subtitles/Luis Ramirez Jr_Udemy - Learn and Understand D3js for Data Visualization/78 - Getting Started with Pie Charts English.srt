00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,430
‫In this lecture, we're going to draw a pie chart, pie charts are another common type of chart to draw.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,940
‫They can show categories of data and how they're proportional to one another.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,920
‫The pie chart will draw will show the estimated population by age as of twenty fifteen.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,740
‫I've gathered data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,640
‫For this example, currently, over 300 million people are living in the U.S. We can use a pie chart

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
‫to display the total population.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,950
‫Each slice in a pie chart can display an age group to give the reader an idea of how many people are

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,270
‫in each age group.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,280
‫Pie charts are great at painting demographics.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,110
‫Let's get started in the resource section of this lecture, I provide a zip file with some Starger files,

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,540
‫download the zip file, unpack the contents and point your editor to those files.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,430
‫Pause the video if you need to.

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:03,030
‫Let's review the files together, firstly, we have a standard HTML document, nothing special is happening

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,150
‫inside this file.

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,470
‫We have the same setup we've been working with since the beginning.

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,500
‫Up next, we have this access file.

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,320
‫The access file contains a few styles.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,650
‫There's nothing special about these styles.

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,850
‫Let's move on to the script file.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,360
‫A lot of it contains the same code we've been writing thus far.

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,890
‫We're retrieving the files, setting the dimensions and drawing the image.

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,530
‫There's one thing I want to note about this code.

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,690
‫We don't have access or functions.

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,370
‫We won't be needing them.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,460
‫Drawing pie charts take a slightly different approach than most charts will go over the steps as we

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,120
‫get to them.

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,270
‫Let's take a peek inside the data file.

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,300
‫We'll be working with they see ASV file again, there are two columns called Name and Value.

29
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,250
‫The name column holds the name of the age group.

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,860
‫The value column holds a number of people within an age group.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,300
‫We're going to draw each age group as a slice of pie.

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,580
‫Inside, each slice will output the total population and group with our data in hand.

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,460
‫Let's start drawing the pie chart.

34
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,440
‫Switch back to the script file.

35
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,450
‫We are going to be writing our code under the scales comment in the draw function.

36
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,660
‫We need to start preparing our data.

37
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,520
‫However, we're not going to be using scales.

38
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,650
‫Previously we would write scales for transforming our data into coordinates.

39
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,020
‫When it comes to pie charts, we're going to need a whole lot more information than some coordinates.

40
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,020
‫We need information about the angles of the slices.

41
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,650
‫How much room should a slice take up in a pie?

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,830
‫It depends on the dimensions of the image and the data.

43
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,370
‫First things first, we need to figure out how big each slice will be.

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,280
‫D3 comes with the function for figuring out how much room a slice will take below the comment.

45
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,670
‫We're going to create a variable called population pie.

46
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,060
‫Its value will be the three pie function.

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,870
‫The three PI function will return a function, the function it returns will perform two tasks.

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,210
‫First, it'll format our data.

49
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,380
‫You can think of it as similar to the Ibin function we use for drawing histograms.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,320
‫The bin function helped us with formatting our data because our data wasn't formatted in a way that

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,440
‫can be used for drawing histograms.

52
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,400
‫We're in a similar situation.

53
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,390
‫The data we have at the moment isn't ready to be drawn as a PI.

54
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,710
‫The second task, the D 3.0 PI function will perform, is calculating how big each slice will be to

55
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,960
‫better understand how this function works.

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,610
‫We'll be using it in a moment.

57
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,060
‫Before we do, we need to tell the pie function which value in our data set it should use for measuring

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,520
‫the slices below this function.

59
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,040
‫We're going to along the data set variable.

60
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,460
‫Next, let's refresh the page in the browser with the console opened.

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,520
‫The data is being stored as an array of objects, the size of each slice in the pie should be based

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,800
‫on the value property.

63
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,380
‫We're going to tell these three to use the value property.

64
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,270
‫We will also convert the type of the value property to a number because it's being stored as a string.

65
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,090
‫Let's go back to the ED.

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,690
‫We will remove the council statement.

67
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,270
‫Next, we're going to change the value function onto the PI function.

68
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:37,310
‫The value function will tell D3 how to access the properties in our data, we need to pass it and accessor

69
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,880
‫function.

70
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,520
‫We don't have them defined, but that's fine.

71
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,180
‫We can pass in an arrow function that accepts the argument.

72
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,710
‫The argument references the objects in the array.

73
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,120
‫We're going to return the value property.

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,730
‫By telling these three how to access our data, it'll be able to calculate how large each slice in the

75
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,180
‫pie should be based on the population in each age group.

76
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,280
‫That's precisely what we want.

77
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,000
‫Our population pie function is ready below.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,930
‫This variable will define another variable called slices.

79
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,190
‫Its value will be the population pie function with the data passed in.

80
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,520
‫We're passing in our data to tell you three to begin formatting our data, the function will return

81
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,710
‫the formatted data.

82
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,780
‫Let's log the value to inspect its contents.

83
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,630
‫Afterward, we will refresh the page.

84
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:45,150
‫We will have an array of objects, the size of the array is the same size as the original data set.

85
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,940
‫If we look inside, any of the objects will find additional properties.

86
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,870
‫Let's go through them one by one.

87
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,640
‫The first property is called data.

88
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,380
‫The data property contains the original data associated with the slice.

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,150
‫The data inside this object is based on the data inside this property.

90
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,050
‫The next property is called Index.

91
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,680
‫The index will tell you the order in which a slice will be drawn.

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,320
‫If you were to look at the array of objects.

93
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,770
‫You'll notice that the index of each object is unique.

94
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,060
‫It'll go from zero to seventeen.

95
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,670
‫This should give you a good idea of the order.

96
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,530
‫The slices will be drawn in afterward.

97
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,380
‫We have the value property.

98
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,620
‫The value property will contain the value that was used to sort and format this slice of the pie.

99
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,670
‫It should correspond to the value we have in the data object.

100
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:45,620
‫The last two properties in the objects are called start angle and and angle lines are not drawn all

101
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,580
‫at once and said pines are drawn by drawing each slice.

102
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:55,220
‫After we're finished drawing each slice, we'll have a pie chart to draw slices.

103
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,880
‫We need to know where each slice should start and end.

104
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,430
‫The technical term you'll come across in the documentation is called an arc and arc.

105
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,090
‫Are those sections or slices of a circle that you see in pie charts, arcs and three required that you

106
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,790
‫pass in a starting angle and end angle.

107
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,010
‫As you can see, D3 has calculated these starting and end angles for us.

108
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,880
‫Thanks to the PI function, our PI is ready to be drawn.

109
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:29,120
‫Before we start drawing the arcs, I want to mention one thing about the values for the start and end

110
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,780
‫angles.

111
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,870
‫The values for the angles are measured in radians.

112
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,340
‫Most of us have been taught to read angles in degrees.

113
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,400
‫However, D3 prefers to use something called radians.

114
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,160
‫Radians are another way to measure an angle.

115
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,610
‫Most mathematicians prefer radians because they're more natural and easier to use in bigger equations.

116
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,290
‫You don't need to be an expert on radians or worry about how they're calculated.

117
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,350
‫Gary can handle calculating and reading radians just in case.

118
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,630
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to more information about radians it's worth

119
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,020
‫reading.

120
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,180
‫If you're curious about understanding radians, it'll break down how radians are measured.

121
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,320
‫In the next lecture, we'll begin drawing the arcs with the new data.
