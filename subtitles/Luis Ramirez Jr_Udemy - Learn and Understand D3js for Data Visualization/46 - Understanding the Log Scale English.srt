‫In this lecture, we are going to explore the long scale, it's another scale that solves a specific

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,090
‫problem that other scales may not be able to address.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,810
‫Let's explore the problems this scale can solve.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,370
‫The long scale transforms continuous data into another set of continuous data.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,270
‫It's very similar to the linear scale because it does the same thing.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,210
‫So what makes it different?

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,720
‫The long scale will apply a logarithmic transformation on the domain before transforming the data.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,140
‫The purpose of a long transformation is to make the distribution of data appear normal.

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,030
‫If you're not familiar with what a log transformation is, that's perfectly fine.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,290
‫The scale does most of the work.

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,310
‫Let's briefly discuss why and when you would want to use a long scale throughout your career.

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,610
‫You will be dealing with different types of data.

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,130
‫If you're dealing with data that relates to money, time or distance, a long scale may be necessary.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,290
‫This rule is not absolute.

15
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,070
‫It's more of a recommendation.

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,240
‫Generally speaking, these are the most common types of data that a log scale is used for.

17
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,610
‫That answer is what kind of data a log scale can be used for, but not why we should use a log scale.

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,980
‫Let's pretend we had a data set that had the numbers one one million and one billion.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,390
‫What do you notice about these numbers?

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,090
‫Their distribution is all over the place.

21
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,480
‫The distance between one and one million is small compared to the distance between one million and one

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,010
‫billion.

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,770
‫Let's say we had to draw this data on this line.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,330
‫We have three circles.

25
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,940
‫The circle on the left represents one.

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,420
‫The second circle represents one million, and the circle on the right represents one billion.

27
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,180
‫There's a lot of empty space between the second and third circles.

28
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,830
‫It's awkward and can be challenging to read.

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,120
‫The problem with the data is how it's distributed.

30
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,710
‫There's too much of a gap between each number.

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,030
‫This is where the long scale comes into play.

32
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,780
‫A long scale will apply a long transformation before transforming the data in layman's terms.

33
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,700
‫This will make the distribution appear normal with a long scale.

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,780
‫The drawing is evenly spaced out.

35
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,320
‫There isn't as much white space as before.

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,460
‫It's much easier to read to.

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,070
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to an article about why you may want to apply

38
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,170
‫Log Transformation's to your data.

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,390
‫This article explains it much better than I can.

40
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,500
‫If you don't fully understand, that's perfectly fine.

41
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,100
‫We will see an example in the next lecture when you're ready.

42
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,090
‫I'll see you there.
