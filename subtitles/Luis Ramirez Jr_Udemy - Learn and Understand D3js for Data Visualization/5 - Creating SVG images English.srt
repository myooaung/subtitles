00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,770
‫In this lecture, we're going to create our first SVG image.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,410
‫There are two ways we can create an image.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,910
‫We can create a separate file for SVG images.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,580
‫Alternatively, we can create an SVG image inside an HTML document.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,520
‫We're going to focus on adding SVG to our HTML documents.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:29,180
‫Unfortunately, the browser will limit some of its features if we try working with SVG files which are

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,630
‫necessary for D3.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:37,100
‫It's much easier to work with SVG images in an HTML document in my editor.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,760
‫I'm in an empty directory.

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,520
‫I'll quickly create an HTML file called Indexed HTML.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,670
‫A template can be scaffolded by typing HTML Colen five.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:00,190
‫There isn't anything special about this document, by default, all browsers support SVG images, you

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:08,020
‫won't have any problems using CGI in your documents and SVG image can be added by adding SVG element.

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:18,030
‫This element is the minimum requirement for creating an SPG image, the SVG element is a container for

15
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,230
‫all your graphics.

16
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,620
‫By default, the image will be empty.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,920
‫Let's add some attributes to the SVG element on the SVG element.

18
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,900
‫We are going to add two attributes called width and height.

19
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,740
‫Both attributes will allow us to configure the dimensions of the image.

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,390
‫It's always good practice to give your SVG images a set width and height.

21
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,010
‫We're going to set both attributes to the number five hundred.

22
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,140
‫Let's preview the document, I'll be using the lying of server extension to serve the files.

23
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,920
‫We'll get a blank page.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,600
‫That's to be expected since we haven't created anything besides setting in images, width and height.

25
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,280
‫Let's inspect Badam by opening the developer tools.

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,670
‫You can open the developer tools on Chrome by pressing F 12 on your keyboard if you're on a Mac.

27
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:22,680
‫This shortcut would be command option ie under the elements panel will be able to view the entire document.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,260
‫The Elements panel allows us to view our document in real time.

29
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,950
‫This is different from viewing the page source.

30
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,880
‫If we were to right click on the page and select view page source, a new tab would be opened.

31
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,520
‫We'll be presented with the document in raw text, this town will show what's what's being delivered

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,350
‫by the server.

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,640
‫It's a great way to check the contents of your document.

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,320
‫However, it does have its limitations.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,520
‫If the page on the browser changes, this tab will not reflect those changes.

36
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,700
‫The elements panel inside the developer tools will allow us to view the document in real time.

37
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,030
‫If anything were to be changed on the page, we would see that change reflected on this panel.

38
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,960
‫For example, you would be able to see when an element disappears or when a new one is added.

39
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,880
‫One of the great things about this panel is being able to modify elements.

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,710
‫If I were to hover my mouse over these elements, they'll be highlighted in the page with the color

41
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,130
‫blue.

42
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,980
‫This tool can tell us how much space an element occupies on the page.

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,710
‫It'll even tell us the position of the element.

44
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,520
‫If we dig deep enough, we'll find the SVG image.

45
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,190
‫After hovering my mouse over this element, you can see its spot on the page, there's even a tooltip

46
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,290
‫to tell us the dimensions of the element.

47
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,090
‫The dimensions are five hundred by five hundred.

48
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,930
‫This is precisely how he defined it earlier.

49
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,320
‫The developer tools are going to come in handy, especially this feature of being able to view where

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,240
‫our elements are on the page.

51
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,310
‫It will help us debug our charts during development.

52
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,570
‫Perfect.

53
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,450
‫We've created our first image.

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,040
‫It's nothing fantastic.

55
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,560
‫But we'll get to drawing some things in a moment.

56
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,050
‫Before I am this lecture, I want to point out one more thing about the SVG element.

57
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,540
‫The SVG element can be treated as a regular HTML element.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,890
‫We can apply classes, ideas and even bind JavaScript events to this element.

59
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,590
‫This is one of the reasons why ID3 uses SVG.

60
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,430
‫Not only can they adapt to any size, but they can be easily modified to suit our needs.

61
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,410
‫This flexibility will allow us to make our charts interactive.

62
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,320
‫We don't have to set the width and height attributes on the SVG element.

63
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,030
‫We can apply a class to the element, then we can add CFS properties to it.

64
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,990
‫Throughout this course we'll be using a combination, of course, as a HTML and JavaScript to create

65
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,830
‫our graphs.

66
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,250
‫In the next couple of lectures, we'll look at how we can draw shapes with SPG.
