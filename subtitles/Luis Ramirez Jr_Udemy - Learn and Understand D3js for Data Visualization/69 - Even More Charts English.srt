‫In this section, we're going to draw a couple of charts, we've explored most of the core functionality

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,810
‫that D3 has to offer, the process of drawing a chart can become repetitive at this point.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,230
‫The purpose of this section is to explain how other charts are drawn.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,600
‫Feel free to jump around this Section two charts that you're interested in learning to draw.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,360
‫Similar to before, a lot of the first few steps will be skips to prevent the course from becoming too

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,100
‫repetitive.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,490
‫I'll be sure to explain the steps and code we haven't encountered before.

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,720
‫I hope you're ready.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,640
‫I'll see you in the next lecture.
