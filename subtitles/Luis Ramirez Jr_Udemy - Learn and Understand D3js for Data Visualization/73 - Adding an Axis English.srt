00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,500
‫In this lecture, we're going to add an axis to the line chart, it's difficult to read the chart without

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,460
‫understanding how the data is measured.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,940
‫We will add an axis for the date and price of the stock.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,660
‫This process should be familiar to you by now, trying tackling this problem as an exercise.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,400
‫Pause the video and draw an axis.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,140
‫Good luck.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,620
‫Welcome back.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,540
‫If you were able to draw an axis, then congrats.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,440
‫If not, we will tackle this exercise together.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,660
‫We will be working at the bottom of the draw function at a comment that says Axis.

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,420
‫Below this comment, we will create a y axis, the name of the variable for storing the axis function

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,070
‫will be called y axis.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,280
‫Its value will be the D 3.0 axis left function with the Windscale function passed in.

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:00,100
‫The axis left function will draw a vertical axis with the tickers pointing to the left, we are going

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,580
‫to modify the checks by changing the TIC format function.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,110
‫The y axis will display the price of the stock, we will add the dollar signs symbol next to the TIC

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,250
‫labels to help the reader understand that this axis measures the price.

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,760
‫We can add this symbol by using the ETIC format function.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,760
‫We will pass in an arrow function where that's passed and the label of the check, we will refer to

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,990
‫the label as D.

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,340
‫We are going to use a string literal to return the label with the dollar signs symbol.

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,470
‫The axis is ready, we will draw in a group by calling the container append function.

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,380
‫Next, we will change the call function to call the Y axis function.

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,950
‫Let's work on the x axis, the x axis will help the reader understand the timeline, even though we're

25
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,240
‫using a time scale, the process for drawing an axis doesn't change.

26
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,600
‫D three, we'll be able to accommodate our time scale.

27
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,630
‫We will define a variable called x axis.

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,470
‫Its value will be the three axis bottom function.

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,130
‫This function will draw a horizontal axis with the sticks pointing down we will pass in the X scale

30
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,770
‫function to help it understand our values.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,200
‫Afterward, we will create another group for this axis by calling the container a pen function.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,680
‫Then we will change the call function with the x axis function.

33
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,860
‫One more thing, we should move the access to the bottom of the chart by default, D3 will drop this

34
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,670
‫axis at the top of the chart.

35
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,230
‫We will move the axis down by changing the style function.

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,590
‫We will set the transform property to the following translate why dimensions, container, height,

37
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,340
‫pixels.

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,370
‫The axes are already let's refresh the page.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,010
‫Both are axes are working, we now have a way for the reader to understand the data, our chart is complete.

40
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,800
‫In the next lecture, we'll look at a few ways to change the look and feel of the line with some additional

41
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,610
‫functions.

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,590
‫I'll see you there.
