00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.740
‫In this lecture, we're going to use mouse events to help us detect when the reader is hovering over

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.240
‫a dot.

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.480
‫If they are, we're going to move the tooltip element above the dot.

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.290
‫The contents of the tooltip will need to be updated to show the data joined to the DOT, a mouse event

5
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.880
‫called Mouse Enter can be used to detect when the mouse is hovering over an element.

6
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.790
‫We'll be using this event to help us create the functionality we're looking for in the script file.

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.970
‫Search for the section in our code where we draw the dots.

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.750
‫At the end of this chain, we will add the on function to listen for an event.

9
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.570
‫The name of the event is called Mouse Enter.

10
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.180
‫The second argument to the on function is a callback function will pass any function to handle the event.

11
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.890
‫One thing I want to note is that I'm not using an arrow function.

12
00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.940
‫The reason I'm not using an arrow function is because we want to use the this keyword the this keyword

13
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.950
‫in the function will tell us which dot the mouse is hovered over, even though we're listening for the

14
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.880
‫event on the entire selection.

15
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.460
‫These three is smart enough to provide us with the information about a specific dot.

16
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.600
‫In addition, we're going to need the data joined to the element.

17
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.110
‫We can accept it as one of the arguments to the callback function will add to arguments which will call

18
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.710
‫event and datum.

19
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.140
‫The datum argument holds the data points to the element, let's log in to verify its contents.

20
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.840
‫In the browser, refresh the page with the console panel open from the developer tools.

21
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.680
‫If we hover our mouse over any of the dots, the object joined to the dot is locked in the console.

22
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.790
‫Perfect.

23
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.860
‫We have all the information we'll need.

24
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.630
‫The next step is to move the tooltip over the dot switch back to the editor.

25
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.910
‫We're going to remove the long statement.

26
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.380
‫We don't need it anymore.

27
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.500
‫The tooltip doesn't have a selection in our scripts, let's create a selection for it.

28
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.310
‫Scroll to where we created these selections for the container and SVG image below.

29
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.570
‫The two variables will create a variable called tooltip.

30
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.910
‫Its value will be the three select function with the tooltip as the selection.

31
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.090
‫We're going to be making a lot of changes to the tooltip, it's a good idea to store a selection object

32
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.610
‫for this element will be needing it soon.

33
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.130
‫Let's go back to the callback function for the event listener.

34
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.880
‫There are two things we'll handle in this function.

35
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.500
‫First, will change the color and size of the dot the reader is hovering over.

36
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.120
‫This effect will help the reader understand which dot they're viewing information about.

37
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.690
‫Second, we're going to move the tooltip.

38
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.120
‫We'll start with changing the appearance of the DOT in this function will select the DOT by using the

39
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.360
‫D3 dot select function with the this keyword.

40
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.620
‫The this keyword will reference the element the reader is hovering over after selecting this element.

41
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.130
‫We're going to change the attribute function.

42
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.970
‫The first attribute will update is the fill attribute.

43
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.070
‫Its value will be the following hash one two zero zero seven eight.

44
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.660
‫This hex code will change the color of the dot to purple.

45
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.650
‫Next, we'll change another attribute function for the radius.

46
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.440
‫The size will increase from five to eight.

47
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.940
‫Let's start moving the tooltip, we're going to use the tooltip selection to change the elements, display

48
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.260
‫property to block.

49
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.360
‫The tool tip is hidden because it's display property is set to none, we'll need to set this property

50
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.540
‫to block to make it visible again after changing its visibility.

51
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.510
‫We'll chain another style method.

52
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.700
‫This time will change the position of the tooltip by changing its top property.

53
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:17.620
‫The value for this property will be the following why scale, why accessor datum minus twenty five.

54
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.980
‫The top property will move the tooltip on its y axis or using the Y scale and y axis or functions to

55
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.490
‫help us calculate the position of the tooltip after calculating the value with the scale we're subtracting.

56
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.050
‫Twenty five, because you want the tooltip to appear above the dot, not on it.

57
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.470
‫The next property will set is the left property.

58
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.960
‫Its value will be the following X scale X accessor diatom.

59
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.780
‫The left property will move the element on its x axis, the X scale and x axis or functions will help

60
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.580
‫us calculate the correct value.

61
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.250
‫We're finished with the mouse enter event.

62
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.670
‫Before we test this code, we will need to remove the tooltip and revert the DOT to its original appearance

63
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.080
‫if the reader hovers away.

64
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.080
‫Otherwise, the dots will always be enlarged.

65
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.390
‫The tooltip will never appear, which can become annoying.

66
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.580
‫We're going to chain another on function to these circles selection.

67
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.240
‫This time we will listen for an event called Mouse Leave.

68
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.840
‫This event is emitted whenever the mouse leaves an element it's been hovering over, we will pass in

69
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.440
‫a callback function to handle what happens if this event is emitted.

70
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.230
‫In this function, we will revert the appearance of the dots.

71
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.130
‫We are going to select the element by using the three select function with the this keyword.

72
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.430
‫Next, we're going to change the attribute function to set the field property to read.

73
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.450
‫This value was the original color of the days afterward will set the radius property to five with the

74
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.620
‫attribute function.

75
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.800
‫We're finished with the dots, the last thing to do is to hide the tooltip with the tooltip selection

76
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.810
‫object, we're going to set the display property to none by changing the style function.

77
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.600
‫The tooltip is ready.

78
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.220
‫Let's refresh the page and the browser to view the final results.

79
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.440
‫If we were to hover our mouse over any of the dots, they would change their appearances, the tooltip

80
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.460
‫will also appear.

81
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.350
‫That's great.

82
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.860
‫We've successfully moved the tooltip with mouse events.

83
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.810
‫One of the main takeaways from this lecture is how D3 makes it incredibly easy to select elements and

84
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.310
‫event is being applied to.

85
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.330
‫Also, it provides us with the data Joynes to the elements.

86
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.900
‫All the information will need is conveniently given to us.

87
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.420
‫In the next lecture.

88
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.460
‫We'll finish the tooltip by updating the contents with information about the dot the reader is hovering

89
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.870
‫over.

90
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.080
‫I'll see you there.
