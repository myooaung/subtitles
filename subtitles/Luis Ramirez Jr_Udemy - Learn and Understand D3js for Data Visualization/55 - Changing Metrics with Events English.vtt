00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.360
‫In this lecture, we're going to refactor the histogram we've created at the moment, it's displaying

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.130
‫the humidity.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.580
‫We have other data available within the data file.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.930
‫One of the great things about D3 is that it's able to handle updates.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.860
‫We can remove, add or update the histogram even after it's been drawn.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.730
‫We're not restricted to drawing a chart once.

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.230
‫Here's what we'll do.

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.990
‫We are going to allow the reader to select any metric they want.

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.680
‫After selecting a metric, the histogram will be updated.

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.520
‫Everything will change from the bars to the axis and labels.

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.720
‫The first thing we'll need to handle is setting up a way to change the metric.

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.460
‫We are going to use a dropdown on the dropdown.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.600
‫We will listen for a change event.

14
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.270
‫If the change event gets fired, we will begin the process of redrawing the histogram.

15
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.030
‫Let's begin open the index, not HTML file above the chart element.

16
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.530
‫We will add a dropdown.

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.930
‫There are six metrics we are going to add there, the following humidity.

18
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.840
‫Windspeed.

19
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.360
‫The value for each option matches the property name in our data set, the entire contents of the option

20
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.110
‫are human readable names when the reader selects an option.

21
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.180
‫We will be using the value attribute to determine which data set to select.

22
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.980
‫After adding the options, we should assign an ID to the dropdown.

23
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.650
‫We'll need to select it when starting writing the JavaScript portion of the code.

24
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.690
‫The ID for this element will be metric.

25
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.230
‫This I.D. will come in handy when we need to select it.

26
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.840
‫One more thing, we will add the selected attribute to the humidity option.

27
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.700
‫This attribute will tell the browser to select this option by default, the dropdown is ready.

28
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.360
‫Let's listen for any event on this dropdown.

29
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.510
‫Switch over to the script file.

30
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.410
‫We will be listening for the event at the bottom of the draw function.

31
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.520
‫It's normal to listen for events after everything has been drawn.

32
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.620
‫We don't want to interrupt the drawing halfway through.

33
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.480
‫We'll need to take the first step to select the element we want to listen for.

34
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.200
‫Events on D3 supports all JavaScript events.

35
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.020
‫We can listen for events by making a selection.

36
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.550
‫We are going to make a selection that the D3 select function.

37
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.390
‫We're performing the selection with the three object instead of the other selection objects in the function

38
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.280
‫we will pass in the ID of the dropdown, which is hash metrick.

39
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.730
‫On this selection, we will change the on function to listen for an event called Change.

40
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.900
‫The on function allows us to listen for events on the element this function is a part of the selection

41
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.590
‫library.

42
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.230
‫The on function has two arguments the name of the event and a callback function.

43
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.500
‫The event we're listening for is called change.

44
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.350
‫It will be fired whenever the value changes.

45
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.160
‫We will pass in a callback function for the second argument.

46
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.280
‫The callback function can accept an optional argument called event, we will refer to it as E, this

47
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.020
‫object will contain information about the event.

48
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.320
‫It's the same object you would encounter when handling events with vanilla JavaScript.

49
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.380
‫Inside this function, we will call the prevent default function to stop the default behavior.

50
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.720
‫It's always a good idea to stop the default browser behavior in case something happens, the next thing

51
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.970
‫we'll do is log the this keyword.

52
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.200
‫The this keyword will hold the element that's tied to the event.

53
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.070
‫Let's refresh the page with the console open.

54
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.860
‫If I were to change the value, the element will get locked in the console, we're successfully listening

55
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.510
‫for changes on the dropdown.

56
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.070
‫We can move on to updating the histogram, switch back to the editor.

57
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.460
‫We are going to remove the long statement we made in the callback function for the event.

58
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.970
‫We don't need it anymore.

59
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.860
‫Above the event listener, we will create a function called histogram.

60
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.060
‫The histogram function will be responsible for updating the charge, the histogram function will have

61
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.070
‫one argument called Metrick.

62
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.450
‫The metric argument will tell which metric from the data it should use to update the chart, we will

63
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.590
‫provide this function.

64
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.560
‫The data, when we call it in our events callback function, we will call the histogram function with

65
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.750
‫the this value property.

66
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.330
‫The value from the dropdown can be accessed via the value property, we have all the information we

67
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.020
‫need in the next lecture.

68
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.100
‫We will begin updating the chart based on the selection.
