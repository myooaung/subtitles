00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.040
‫It's time to start writing some code in this lecture.

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.160
‫We're going to learn about selections.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.970
‫Selections are objects that represent an element on the document.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.650
‫Selections are the most common types of objects you'll be working with industry.

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.730
‫A selection will give us the power to perform operations such as adding, deleting or modifying elements

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.170
‫in the browser.

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.710
‫There are already a set of functions for selecting elements.

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.870
‫The native browser functions can also add, delete or modify elements.

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.180
‫The document query selector is an example of a function that's already available.

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.500
‫Regardless, D three provides its own version of a function that can select an element called D three

11
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.460
‫select.

12
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.230
‫It works similarly to the native browser functions.

13
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.210
‫It's not exactly clear when you would want to use the D3 function instead of the regular function defined

14
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.050
‫by the browser.

15
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.410
‫Let's explore the differences between the two functions.

16
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.990
‫We're going to start by working in the index, not HTML file.

17
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.850
‫The goal of this lecture is to select an element by selecting an element will be able to perform actions

18
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.730
‫such as changing its properties or adding elements.

19
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.920
‫First, we need an element in our document that we can select inside the body tags, add a paragraph

20
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.690
‫tag with some dummy content.

21
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.340
‫We will select this element in our JavaScript file.

22
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.210
‫Switch over to the app JS file.

23
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.710
‫In this file will create two variables, the first variable will be called P Browsr.

24
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.400
‫The AP is the name of the element will be selecting I'm adding the browser suffix to indicate that this

25
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.460
‫variable will contain a selection using the native browser functions, the value for this variable will

26
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.970
‫be the document query selector P function.

27
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.880
‫The second variable will be called PD three.

28
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.210
‫The name indicates that this very law contains a selection made by D3, the value for this variable

29
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.970
‫will be D three select P.

30
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.130
‫The three object is a global object defined by the script we included in the HTML file, it's an object

31
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.710
‫but exposes most of these three features.

32
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.520
‫One of the methods we can use on this object is called select.

33
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.340
‫The select function has one argument.

34
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.680
‫It's the element it should select.

35
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.180
‫We need to pass in a string that contains a valid access selector.

36
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.850
‫If we want to select an element by a tag name, we need to pass in the name of the tag.

37
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.110
‫If we want to select elements by classes or IDs, we can use dots or hashes before the name of the class

38
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.860
‫or ID.

39
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.820
‫It's similar to how we would select elements in access.

40
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.630
‫For example, if I had an element with the ID of Foo, I could pass in hash foo.

41
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.130
‫We have two variables that are selecting elements.

42
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.140
‫Let's find out the difference by logging both variables in the console.

43
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.630
‫In the browser, let's view the file with the developer tools opened.

44
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.340
‫For a future lecture's you should always have the server running under the console panel will find both

45
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.850
‫variables have been logged without a problem.

46
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.740
‫The first variable we logged was the element that was selected with the browsers functions.

47
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.490
‫The log will show us the entire element and its contents.

48
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.720
‫However, there are underlying methods and properties we can use.

49
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.640
‫If I were to hover my mouse over this object, the browser will highlight the element in the page.

50
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.730
‫This feature is helpful because it can tell us exactly what element we selected.

51
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.350
‫The other object being logged is called selection.

52
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.420
‫One important note I want to make if you're using the minified version of D three, you may see a different

53
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.810
‫name.

54
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.160
‫The minified version changes the name of some objects to a shorter name.

55
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.370
‫It's to reduce the file size.

56
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.870
‫This is why I recommend working with the non minified version of D three for development.

57
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.990
‫The names in the console will be much more descriptive.

58
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.050
‫However, don't worry, there isn't a difference between the objects returned other than the name.

59
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.470
‫The properties and methods inside the object will be the same.

60
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.150
‫The D3 select function returns a selection object.

61
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.000
‫A selection is a JavaScript object that references an HTML element on the page.

62
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.250
‫It may not look like it, but we are selecting the paragraph element in our documents.

63
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.630
‫I'm going to quickly go into the object until I come across the element.

64
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.080
‫Eventually I'll find the paragraph elements.

65
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.900
‫If I hover my mouse over this element, the browser will highlight the element in the document just

66
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.680
‫like before.

67
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.540
‫The main difference between both objects is that the three object will contain additional methods and

68
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.090
‫properties, we can use them for manipulating the element.

69
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.570
‫I find that D 3D version of a selection object is much easier to work with.

70
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.220
‫We'll be able to interact with the element in the document through this object.

71
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.640
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the D3 selection repository.

72
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.900
‫The three selection package is responsible for handling selecting elements in the documents it can do

73
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.480
‫other things, such as manipulate elements, joined data and merge other selections.

74
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.320
‫The D.

75
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.770
‫Three selection package is part of the full version of D.

76
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.110
‫Well, you don't need to install it.

77
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.960
‫If we want to use the methods listed on this page, they're already available to us.

78
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.300
‫This page will document everything you'd want to know about how to select elements.

79
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.400
‫Feel free to read this page after you're finished with this course, we will discuss many of its features

80
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.480
‫throughout the course.

81
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.830
‫Let's dig into what was returned by the D3 dot select function.

82
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.000
‫Inside this object, we will find two properties called groups and parents, the group Saray contains

83
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.040
‫a list of elements found by the function.

84
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.430
‫Since we're using the select method, the array will always contain one element unless it didn't find

85
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.000
‫anything.

86
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.660
‫Even if there are multiple elements that match the query, selector D3 will return the first elements

87
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.500
‫it finds.

88
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.830
‫The parents array contains a list of elements that are the parent elements of the original selection.

89
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.370
‫If we look inside of this array, we'll find one element.

90
00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.220
‫It's the HTML element, which is the parent of the paragraph element we selected.

91
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.600
‫This array can be useful if you ever want to view the parent elements.

92
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.550
‫There's a lot going on here.

93
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.070
‫All we did was write one line of code.

94
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.470
‫D3 took care of the rest by generating a lot of these properties.

95
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.430
‫Luckily, we won't have to worry about the complex details of this object.

96
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.990
‫D3 comes with methods that make it easier to work with selections.

97
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.990
‫We'll explore some of those methods in this section.

98
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.770
‫Before we do, there's one more method I want to introduce.

99
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.720
‫Let's switch back to the editor.

100
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:42.010
‫The select method will grab the first element it finds, for example, if I pass in a paragraph tag,

101
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.230
‫this method will select the first paragraph element.

102
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:51.560
‫It finds even if we had multiple paragraph elements on the page, this method, it would only grab the

103
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.250
‫first one.

104
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.100
‫If we wanted to grab all the paragraph tags on the page, we can swap this method out with the select

105
00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.720
‫all method.

106
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:08.940
‫Deselect all method will allow us to grab multiple elements to better test this method, let's add some

107
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.560
‫additional paragraph tags to our documents.

108
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.440
‫I'm going to add two more.

109
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.320
‫Then let's switch over to the browser.

110
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:28.020
‫In the console, we will find the same two properties, groups and parents, the groups array is populated

111
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.490
‫with all our elements, will find the three paragraph tags we had in our documents.

112
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:39.020
‫One difference you may notice, is that D3 will refer to this array as a node list.

113
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.450
‫You'll hear the word node a lot in tutorials.

114
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:48.780
‫A node is the technical term for the elements, attributes and content inside the document.

115
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.760
‫Your elements are nodes.

116
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.280
‫The attributes inside them are nodes.

117
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.280
‫Even the text inside your elements are nodes.

118
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:03.330
‫When you see the word node list is describing a list of HTML elements, you can think of it more as

119
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.710
‫a list of selections.

120
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.640
‫Bidi three.

121
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.200
‫That's about it.

122
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.050
‫Before we in this lecture, we're going to revert things to their original state in the editor.

123
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.600
‫We're going to remove the paragraph tags.

124
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.380
‫In the app file, we will change the method back to the select method.

125
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.420
‫Lastly, we will comment about the query selector method.

126
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.830
‫We're simplifying the file for future lectures in the next one, we'll look at how we can interact with

127
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.670
‫deselection.
