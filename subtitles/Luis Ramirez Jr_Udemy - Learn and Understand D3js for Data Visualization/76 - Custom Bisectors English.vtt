00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.020
‫In this lecture, we're going to create a custom by sector function, D3 comes with a bisect function,

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.720
‫but it's only capable of comparing numbers.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.550
‫We need to compare dates.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.940
‫Luckily, D3 comes with a function for creating a custom by sector for searching through an array with

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.440
‫non numeric values.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.690
‫We're going to continue working on the event handler function inside the function.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.180
‫We are going to remove the index variable.

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.480
‫It's being set too early because we don't have the custom by sector function defined.

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.290
‫Next, we will add a comment that says custom by sector.

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.610
‫Below this comment, we will define a variable called by sector, its value will be the three by sector

11
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.150
‫function.

12
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.150
‫Device sector function will allow us to create a custom bisect function, the reason will create a custom

13
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.500
‫dissector function is because we need to tell D3 how to access the date in our data set.

14
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.520
‫This function has one argument, which is an accessor function we will pass in the X accessor function.

15
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.700
‫The x axis or function will help D3 access the date within the data set.

16
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.810
‫It will also pass the date into a date object.

17
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.900
‫Since the date is stored as a string, the return value of this function will be an object with three

18
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.740
‫properties.

19
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.640
‫I'll type the name of the properties in the comment above there, the left, center and right properties.

20
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.730
‫Each property is a function, it's possible the wine sect function may find multiple locations to insert

21
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.240
‫the H.

22
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.290
‫D three provides us with three options for deciding where to insert the date.

23
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.990
‫We can choose the lowest possible index, which is what the left function does.

24
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.600
‫The right function will choose the highest possible index, while the central function will choose the

25
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.690
‫index in the middle.

26
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.580
‫We're going to opt to use the left function.

27
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.910
‫We will change the left properties so that we're returned to the left function.

28
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.780
‫Any of the functions work, however, in most examples, devs will use the left function, our custom

29
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.340
‫by sector function is ready.

30
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.400
‫Let's try using it below or going to create a variable called index.

31
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.050
‫Its value will be the bisect function.

32
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.460
‫The custom bisect function has the same arguments as D 3s bisect function there, the data to search

33
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.070
‫through and the element we want to insert, we will pass in the data set and date variables.

34
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.280
‫This function will return an index where we can insert the date, we can proceed to use this index to

35
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.310
‫grab the object.

36
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.420
‫We will declare another variable.

37
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.420
‫Its value will be the following data set index minus one.

38
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.090
‫We're not trying to insert an element.

39
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.260
‫Instead, we're trying to find the object that matches the date we created above, the value of the

40
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.030
‫index variable will be the index where we should insert the date.

41
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.390
‫Once again, we're not trying to insert an element into the array.

42
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.330
‫The index we're trying to grab should be the index of the object that corresponds to where the readers

43
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.210
‫mouse is hovering over this index is to the left of the index being returned by our custom bisect function.

44
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.400
‫This is why we're subtracting one from the index.

45
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.920
‫Let's update the long statement to log the variable.

46
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.820
‫Next, refresh the page in the browser.

47
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.110
‫As we drag our mouse, objects are being logged in the console, great, we're able to retrieve the

48
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.890
‫information that corresponds to the readers mouse.

49
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.800
‫It's time to use this information to update the UI elements for the tool.

50
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.470
‫Let's start with the circle.

51
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.110
‫Switch back to the editor.

52
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.840
‫We're going to remove the console statement.

53
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.290
‫We don't need it anymore.

54
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.050
‫Next, you will add a comment that says update image.

55
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.860
‫Using the tool dots election, we're going to change the style function to change the opacity property

56
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.460
‫to one.

57
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:27.570
‫Then we will change the attribute function to set the attribute to the following X scale X accessor.

58
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.130
‫Notice how we're not using an arrow function as the second argument of the attribute function, the

59
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.220
‫element isn't joined with any data.

60
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.460
‫Therefore we're not going to pass in an arrow function.

61
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.490
‫The next attribute will set is these seewhy attribute.

62
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.380
‫We're going to set it to the following Y scale y accessor.

63
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.540
‫One last thing, we will change the race function.

64
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.590
‫The RES function will push the shape to their front of the image, we want to make sure the circle is

65
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.510
‫fully visible in front of the line.

66
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.130
‫Let's refresh the page.

67
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.060
‫As we move our mouse across the image, the dot is following the mouse, it's staying on the line as

68
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.880
‫we wanted to.

69
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.800
‫That's great.

70
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.520
‫We've successfully grabbed the correct information for the tooltip.

71
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.400
‫In the next lecture, we will finish the tooltip.
