00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.610
‫In this lecture, we are going to draw a heat map, heat maps are a way to present data by using color.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.070
‫Color is used to show the difference between different pieces of data.

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.600
‫The variation color, maybe by hue or intensity.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.770
‫This gives the reader an idea of how data varies from one another.

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.810
‫Here's an example of a heat map.

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.470
‫Heat maps are drawn with squares organized in a grid.

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.760
‫We can read the data of this visualization by looking at the colors.

8
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.310
‫This heat map will show how often a GitHub hub user contributes to a repository.

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.200
‫Gray areas indicate little to no contributions, whereas a dark shade of green indicates a lot of contributions.

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.430
‫This heat map gives us an idea of how active a developer is.

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.160
‫As you can see from this chart, the developer was very active in the month of May.

12
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.900
‫It's very easy to tell because of how dark the squares are compared to the other squares.

13
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.920
‫Heat maps are a great way to show activity within a data set.

14
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.350
‫We are going to draw a heat map.

15
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.950
‫It'll give us the opportunity to learn about three scales.

16
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.850
‫We'll discuss those scales in the next lecture.

17
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.220
‫For now, I want to focus on drawing the heat map.

18
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.420
‫In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a starter zip file, download it, unzip the contents

19
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.700
‫and point your editor to the project.

20
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.650
‫Pause the video if you need to.

21
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.580
‫Let's review the files together, we will start with the indexed HTML file in this file, three assets

22
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:43.920
‫are being loaded there to the style access D3, Jazz and jazz files before checking out the other files.

23
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.460
‫Let's look at the body elements inside this element.

24
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.930
‫There's a div tag with the ID of heat map one.

25
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.440
‫It also has a class called Chart.

26
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.730
‫We are going to be drawing multiple heat maps for this demonstration.

27
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.070
‫This part of the course will focus on multiple scales.

28
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.010
‫It would be a good idea to compare the impact a skill can make to a visualization.

29
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.480
‫Therefore, I would just add the starter files to be able to display multiple heat maps.

30
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.430
‫If we open the style access file, we won't find many styles.

31
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.590
‫These styles I've added are for adding some breathing room between each heat map.

32
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.320
‫Let's check out the app JS file.

33
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.500
‫Instead of starting with an empty file, I've gone ahead with preparing some code for you, I I've hammered

34
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.880
‫most of the fundamentals.

35
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.540
‫It's time to take the training wheels off to save time.

36
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.320
‫We will be skipping the first few steps for drawing a visualization.

37
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.290
‫However, I won't leave you completely hanging.

38
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.220
‫We will review what I've given you so that you aren't left in the dark.

39
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.800
‫We have a function called Draw.

40
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.460
‫The Draw function has one argument called elements.

41
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.620
‫Since we will be drawing multiple heat maps, the draw function should be reuseable.

42
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.060
‫This way we don't have to rewrite the same code for every heat map.

43
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.770
‫The draw function will be able to draw the same heat map with different scales.

44
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.960
‫We will be adjusting it in the future.

45
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.600
‫Inside this function, we are performing a request for the data JSON file.

46
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.460
‫Let's open this file next.

47
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.230
‫The data file contains an array of household income within the U.S. there are one hundred items in this

48
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.870
‫array with a variety of values, the heat will be drawn, will show the variation of income.

49
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.180
‫Here are some facts about the data set.

50
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.090
‫The lowest income is zero dollars.

51
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.820
‫The highest income is three hundred thousand five hundred and seventy seven dollars.

52
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.380
‫The average income is fifty one thousand eight hundred and forty nine dollars.

53
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.150
‫The median income is thirty eight thousand five hundred and twenty five dollars.

54
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.490
‫The data is all over the place.

55
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.440
‫It'll be easier to understand it with a heat map.

56
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.660
‫Let's go back to the app file.

57
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.840
‫After requesting the data, the dimensions are set.

58
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.590
‫The heat map is going to be small, but that's perfectly fine.

59
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.670
‫There will be multiple heat maps to compensate for some of the space.

60
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.920
‫After creating the dimensions, the image is being drawn with the dimensions.

61
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.570
‫The image will be drawn in the selection that is based on the element argument.

62
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.280
‫Below this function.

63
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.540
‫We are calling the draw function with the ID of heat map one.

64
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.930
‫Let's view the app in the browser.

65
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.220
‫Using the developer tools under the Elements panel, we will find the SVG image being drawn.

66
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.470
‫In the next lecture, we will begin drawing the heat map with the data.

67
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.600
‫I'll see you there.
