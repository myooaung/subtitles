00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,300
‫In this lecture, we're going to do two things.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:09,210
‫First, we're going to change the colors of the bars before playing the animation colors can be a great

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,390
‫way of helping the reader understand if a shape is being added or removed.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,180
‫Currently, the bars will always remain the same color, regardless of what happens.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,600
‫The second thing we'll do is animate the labels properly.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,230
‫They are experiencing the same issue we had with the bars.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,180
‫Let's start with the color of the bars and our editors.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,910
‫We are going to update the functions we pass into the joint function.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,010
‫We'll start with the first function.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,060
‫At the end of the chain, we will chain one more attribute method.

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,420
‫The attribute will change is the fil attribute.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,880
‫The color will be the following hash.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,010
‫B.H. Desex F.

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,880
‫This code will give us the color green green is a color associated with the activity of adding new shapes.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,380
‫We were going to use this color to show the reader that new data is being added.

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:07,660
‫Next, we will change the color of the shapes being removed in the third function before we change the

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,900
‫transition function.

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,400
‫We will change the attribute method for the final attribute.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,920
‫We are changing the color before the transition because we want the colors to change immediately.

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,680
‫It doesn't make sense for the bars to change to Orange wants the shapes are removed.

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,380
‫The color for this selection will be the following hash F3 nine, two, three, three.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,590
‫This hex code will turn the bars into orange.

23
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,580
‫Let's give things a test by refreshing the browser.

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,240
‫The bars will change color based on if they're being added or removed.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,940
‫Great, let's move on to fixing the labels.

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,740
‫Animation's trying this as an exercise.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,320
‫It's the same as before.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,660
‫The labels being added should rise up into place instead of zooming in from the left.

29
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,320
‫Labels being removed should go down instead of disappearing.

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,580
‫Paused the video.

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,330
‫And good luck.

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,790
‫Welcome back.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,000
‫If you are able to accomplish this task, that's great.

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,750
‫If not, that's fine, too.

35
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,940
‫We'll do it together.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,960
‫Let's get started.

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,210
‫We're going to modify the section of our code where we added the labels to the document.

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,020
‫We need to override the default behavior of the joint function.

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,760
‫We will pass in three functions to override the behavior.

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,860
‫The first function will be for the enter selection.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,850
‫We will pass in an arrow function that accepts the enter selection.

42
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,470
‫We will return the entire selection.

43
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,260
‫Next, we will chamba append method to Abdeh text elements.

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,640
‫Afterward, we will copy these three functions we made after the joint function and paste them after

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,230
‫appending the text element.

46
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,840
‫We want the labels to appear at the bottom of the container.

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,880
‫We are going to modify the wine attribute to the dimensions container property to position it at the

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,360
‫bottom.

49
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,130
‫The entire selection is ready, we will work on the exit selection next, we are going to add a second

50
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,850
‫arrow function that will accept the update selection and return it.

51
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,010
‫We aren't going to modify the behavior of the update selection.

52
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,920
‫It's working fine as is, we're adding it in because we need to access the exit selection.

53
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,540
‫We will pass in a third arrow function that will accept in the exit selection and return it.

54
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,270
‫The transition function will be changed so that we can animate the labels.

55
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,130
‫Next, we will set the white attribute to the dimensions, container, height, property.

56
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,340
‫This will make the labels go down with the bars.

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,310
‫Lastly, we will change the remove function.

58
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,190
‫There's one last thing we'll do, we want the labels to be removed before proceeding to animate the

59
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,880
‫labels that need to be moved.

60
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,170
‫Luckily, we can use the exit transition and update transition objects.

61
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,870
‫We will pass the exit transition object into the transition function on the exit selection.

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,590
‫The update transition object will be passed into the transition function change after the joint function.

63
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,690
‫Now, you may be wondering, will this be blocked by the bars if there are multiple transitions playing

64
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,320
‫at once?

65
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,250
‫D three, we'll check if transitions have matching IDs, if there are matching IDs, D3 will play the

66
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,560
‫transitions in sync.

67
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,810
‫We don't have to worry about transitions blocking other transitions as long as they have the same ID,

68
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,070
‫the labels being removed will transition with the bars being removed.

69
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,190
‫Same goes for the labels that need to be moved after the other labels have been removed.

70
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,060
‫Let's refresh the page.

71
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:14,810
‫The labels are animating perfectly, regardless of their being added or removed, the animations for

72
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,030
‫the labels are in sync with the bars.

73
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,980
‫That's great.

74
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,890
‫We're finished with the histogram.

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,400
‫It was a lot of work, but we got through it.

76
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,800
‫In the next lecture.

77
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,080
‫We'll look at a bonus feature we can add to the histogram.
