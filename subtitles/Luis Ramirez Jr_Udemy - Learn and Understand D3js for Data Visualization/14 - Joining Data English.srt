00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,930
‫In this lecture, we're going to learn about a process called joining data, we've been focused on working

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,740
‫with elements.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,230
‫It's time to introduce data into the mix data.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,950
‫When you hear that word, what do you think it means?

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,990
‫It's a very broad term that can mean a lot of things.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,650
‫What exactly is data in the programming?

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,440
‫In technology, world data is almost everything.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,050
‫Images, audio files, text.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,480
‫The browser you're using to watch this video is data.

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,370
‫Luckily, when it comes to these three, data is broken down.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,600
‫To be more specific.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,990
‫Data two, three is text and numbers.

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,410
‫Data by itself can't do anything.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,660
‫There needs to be an additional tool for displaying data to a reader.

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,960
‫That's where D3 comes into play.

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,400
‫Data visualization can be broken down into pieces.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,660
‫There's the data itself, which can be text or number based, for example, the number of dog owners

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,450
‫in a city or the income of family households.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,570
‫All of this would be considered data.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,360
‫The second piece of data visualization is the visual part.

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,110
‫In our case, this would be the achievement and access.

22
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:14,780
‫The average reader can't understand raw data or understand HTML access.

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,990
‫We need a way to connect our data with our HTML D3 as a library that bridges this gap.

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,140
‫It makes it easy to combine data in the visual.

25
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,360
‫The process of associating a piece of data with an element is known as joining data.

26
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,440
‫D3 makes it very easy to join data.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,700
‫It's able to handle large amounts of data efficiently.

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,440
‫Let's say we had an array of data in the array.

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,170
‫There are a total of five items in our document that can be five paragraph elements.

30
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,740
‫Neither the array nor elements are connected to one another.

31
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,440
‫We can use D three to join the data.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,880
‫This would mean the number 10 is associated with the first paragraph element.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,080
‫The number twenty would be associated with the second paragraph element.

34
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,930
‫The number thirty would be associated with the third paragraph element, so on and so forth.

35
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,200
‫By joining data, we can manipulate the behavior of the element based on the data.

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,280
‫For example, we can change in elements text color if it's below the number thirty.

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,940
‫When we start drawing charts, we can use the data to change the size, position and color of a shape.

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,480
‫We are going to be working in an empty directory.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,480
‫We will be starting with a new set of files, point your editor to an empty directory.

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,270
‫Next, create a file called Indexed HTML.

41
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,250
‫We will scaffold a template by typing each HTML Colen five.

42
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,800
‫Afterward, we will quickly load D3 through a CDN, you can grab a link to the CDN on the official website.

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,230
‫Then we will create a file called App Dot James.

44
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,100
‫Lastly, we will load the script after loading these three.

45
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:22,250
‫The goal of this lecture is to join some data to our elements in our HTML document, we will add in

46
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,300
‫unordered list.

47
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,530
‫In the list, we will add five list items, each list item should have some dummy content.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,960
‫We have a plane list, we will use these three to join some data to the list, switch over to the script,

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,640
‫file at the top.

50
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,220
‫We will create an array called data.

51
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,150
‫It's common practice to use the name data in our array.

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,780
‫We will add five numbers.

53
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,560
‫Are we using the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50?

54
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,250
‫Our template and data already the last step is to join the data, we can join the data after we've made

55
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,030
‫a selection by creating a selection, D3 will know which set of elements we want to join our data to.

56
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,740
‫Below this variable, we will create another variable called E-L.

57
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,570
‫We will assign this variable to the D three select all function.

58
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:35,160
‫The name of the element we want to select is the list item element, we are using these select all method

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,710
‫because we have multiple items in our array.

60
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,720
‫Typically when you have an array of data, you don't want to join them one at a time.

61
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,260
‫It's faster to merge multiple selections with an array.

62
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,720
‫After making the selection, we will change a function called data.

63
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,670
‫It has one argument, which is the data that should be joined with the selection we will pass in the

64
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,510
‫data array.

65
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,220
‫D3 will begin the process of joining the data with our selection, we have an array of selections and

66
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,280
‫an array of data.

67
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,570
‫The first selection will be joined with the first item in the data array.

68
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,560
‫The second selection will be joined with the second item in the data array, so on and so forth.

69
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,490
‫We have a total of five list item elements and five numbers.

70
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:28,330
‫Every number should be joined to an element we can verify if the join was a success by locking the element

71
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,050
‫variable.

72
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,600
‫In the browser, refresh the page.

73
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,020
‫Not much has changed on the page.

74
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,040
‫Let's review the developer tools under the Elements panel, the list item remains unaffected.

75
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,060
‫We won't find additional attributes or changes to the list that's to be expected since we didn't do

76
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,400
‫anything after performing the join, the real changes are happening internally under the console panel.

77
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,490
‫We will find a selection object.

78
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,140
‫They data function will always return a new selection, these election year returns will be the selection.

79
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:15,160
‫It was called on, but with the joint data, upon inspecting the contents, we will find a few differences

80
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,970
‫from previous selection objects.

81
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,520
‫There are two new properties called Enter and Exit.

82
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,800
‫Both properties contain arrays.

83
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,050
‫We are going to ignore both properties in this lecture.

84
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,270
‫In the upcoming lectures, we will explore what these properties are for.

85
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,830
‫We want to focus our attention on the group's array.

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,920
‫We have a total of five elements because we have five list items.

87
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,890
‫It's nothing new.

88
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,860
‫So far, however, something has changed to our selection.

89
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,740
‫Let's take a closer look by viewing the contents of the first list item in the array.

90
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,930
‫There are over 200 properties, the properties in this object are the same properties you would find

91
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,200
‫in a regular DOM object, these three has added additional properties to this object.

92
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,640
‫Scroll down to the bottom of the object.

93
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,080
‫The developer tools may not display every property in an object to prevent an object from hijacking

94
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,240
‫the developer tools.

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,460
‫You can view the full contents of the object by clicking on the dots.

96
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,010
‫This will expose a property called Data D three created this property for us.

97
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,460
‫The value for this property is ten.

98
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,490
‫We are looking at the first list item in the array.

99
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,940
‫Therefore it should contain the first number in the array, which is ten.

100
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,130
‫If we look through the second element in the selection, we should find the number twenty.

101
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,610
‫This goes for the other elements in our selection, we successfully joined our data.

102
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,390
‫It's not reflected visibly on the document, but it's a start.

103
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,540
‫We'll look at how we manipulate the elements after joining the selection in the next couple of lectures,

104
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,420
‫we will explore what the entry and exit properties are in the selection object.
