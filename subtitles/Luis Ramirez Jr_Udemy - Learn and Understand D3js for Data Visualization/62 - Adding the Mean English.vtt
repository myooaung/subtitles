00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.180
‫In this lecture, we're going to add a bonus feature to our histogram, the reader may want to know

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.810
‫what they mean is in our data set, they mean is the average value in our data set averages give readers

3
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.800
‫a pretty good idea of what to expect from our data.

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.970
‫We will add the average value by drawing a line in our histogram.

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.680
‫The line will be positioned at where the average is.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.380
‫In addition, the line will animate into a different location whenever the metric changes.

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.710
‫Let's get started in the script file.

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.640
‫We are going to create a selection for the line.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.500
‫They will only be one line in our image.

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.570
‫It wouldn't be a bad idea to draw it before we draw the histogram.

11
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.470
‫We are going to draw the line right before the histogram function.

12
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.490
‫Create a variable called Mean Line, its value will be the container append function.

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.810
‫The element will insert into the container is called line, the line shape is an SFG shape that draws

14
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.330
‫a line when we need to update the line, we are going to reference the mean line selection.

15
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.060
‫Before we do, I'm going to add a class called Mean Line with the class function.

16
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.550
‫The main line class is defined in the stylesheet I provided with these charters it file, it'll change

17
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.320
‫the color of the line to red and make it look a little thicker than the default thickness.

18
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.430
‫The browser will draw the line, but it'll be invisible because we need to set the coordinates.

19
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.520
‫We aren't going to set the coordinates because we don't know where to draw the line yet.

20
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.530
‫That's fine.

21
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.300
‫We're not in a rush to draw it.

22
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.340
‫We are going to set the coordinates after the bars and labels have been drawn.

23
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.470
‫We will manipulate the line after drawing the labels in our function.

24
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.420
‫The first thing we need to figure out is the mean.

25
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.510
‫The mean is the average value in our data set.

26
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.980
‫D3 comes with a function for calculating the mean for us.

27
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.530
‫We will create a variable called mean.

28
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.130
‫Its value will be the three main function.

29
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.920
‫The main function will calculate the mean based on the data we provided.

30
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.900
‫It has two arguments.

31
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.740
‫The first argument is the data we will pass in the data set variable.

32
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.520
‫We are providing the original data set, not the formatted data set, the main function doesn't require

33
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.350
‫the data to be formatted, so we'll just provide it with the original data set.

34
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.620
‫The second argument is an access or function.

35
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.730
‫We need to tell which metric it should calculate the mean for.

36
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.030
‫We will pass MDX accessor function.

37
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.240
‫The value returned by this function will be the mean we can begin to draw the line after calculating

38
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.800
‫the line, we changed the transition function on the mean line selection.

39
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.520
‫We want this election to animate after the labels have been moved, the line should move with the bar.

40
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.770
‫We will pass in the update transition objects.

41
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.360
‫The line's coordinates can be adjusted by setting for attributes, the first two are the X1 and why

42
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.530
‫one attributes.

43
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.670
‫The X one and Y one attributes will be the starting point for the line, the value for the X one attribute

44
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.270
‫will be set to the X scale function with the mean variable.

45
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.630
‫This will calculate the X position, the Y one attribute will be set to zero, the starting point for

46
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.200
‫the line will be at the top of the container where using the mean to move the line across the x axis,

47
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.660
‫the next two attributes will add are the X to and Y two attributes.

48
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.440
‫The extra attribute will be set to the X scale function with the main variable.

49
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.370
‫We want the line to be drawn straight down, it makes sense for the two points to have the same X coordinate,

50
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.070
‫the Y to attribute will be set to the dimensions, container, height, property.

51
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.670
‫The line will be drawn straight down from the top of the container to the bottom of the container,

52
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.060
‫our line is ready.

53
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.700
‫Let's refresh the page.

54
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.250
‫The line will appear giving us an idea of where the average is.

55
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.580
‫However, there is just one problem.

56
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.820
‫It appears behind the other shapes.

57
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.730
‫The reason it appears behind the shapes is because of its placement in the document.

58
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.320
‫Let's open the elements panel and the developer tools.

59
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.990
‫If we were to search for the line, we'll find that it's in the middle of the SVG image, the shapes

60
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.770
‫are layered in the order they're added to the document.

61
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.920
‫The line shape appears behind the other shapes because it's being drawn before the other rectangles.

62
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.310
‫Therefore, it'll be pushed to the back if we want the line to appear in front.

63
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.830
‫We'll need to reinsert it.

64
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.620
‫Switched back to the editor.

65
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.820
‫We're going to change a function called Re's before changing the transition function.

66
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.660
‫The RES function will reinsert an element in the document, elements are inserted at the end of its

67
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.330
‫selection.

68
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.200
‫Therefore, the line will be added last.

69
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.150
‫This will make it appear in front.

70
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.880
‫Let's refresh the page.

71
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.420
‫The line has been moved to the front.

72
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.190
‫Great.

73
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.410
‫We can switch to the other metrics.

74
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.980
‫Regardless of what happens, the line will always move to show the average.

75
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.680
‫We now have a way to display multiple metrics along with their average.

76
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.690
‫In the next lecture, we'll move on to tackling interactions with these three.
