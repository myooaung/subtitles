1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,090
‫We're finally finished with the scatterplot.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,180
‫It took a lot of work, believe it or not, we've been following a series of steps for drawing the scatterplot.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,180
‫We've already talked about the first steps, which are the following one, retrieve the data from an

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,560
‫API or external source to set the dimensions.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,570
‫Three, draw the image.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,840
‫We haven't had the chance to go over the next three steps, but we saw how to perform them in action.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,110
‫The fourth step is to recreate some scales.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,720
‫Scales allow us to transform our data into values we can use for drawing shapes.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,690
‫The fifth step is to start drawing the shapes.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,850
‫We can use the scales we created in the previous step to help us position our shapes.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,700
‫The sixth step is to draw an axis.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,500
‫The axis helps the reader understand how to measure the data.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,970
‫There's an optional additional step.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,060
‫We can add animations and events to the chart.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,910
‫Animations can add pizzazz to a chart.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,950
‫It makes it much more interesting.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,290
‫You may also want to add events for handling interactions with the reader.

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,900
‫This is a step we will be exploring in an upcoming section.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,860
‫Overall, these are steps you'll take when drawing charts.

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,120
‫And three, we will be repeating these steps throughout the entire course.

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,680
‫You will become comfortable with the process in the next couple of sections.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,190
‫We will start drawing other types of charts, explore skills and other advanced topics related to D

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,670
‫three.

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,840
‫I'll see you there.
