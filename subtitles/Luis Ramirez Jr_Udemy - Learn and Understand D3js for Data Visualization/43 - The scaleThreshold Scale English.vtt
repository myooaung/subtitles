00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.100
‫In this lecture, we are going to be exploring one more scale called the threshold scale.

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.120
‫The threshold scale is more customizable than the previous three scales we've been using up till now.

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.130
‫D3 has done the work of calculating how big a bucket is.

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.710
‫It didn't let us set the size of a bucket.

5
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.210
‫The threshold scale allows us to configure how data is distributed.

6
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.310
‫Let's explore how the threshold scale works.

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.370
‫The threshold scale will transform continuous data into discrete data.

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.130
‫It's the same as the quantize and quantize scales.

9
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.900
‫We are going to be using this scale to transform the data into three colors.

10
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.810
‫The colors will be white, pink and red.

11
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.150
‫Before we proceed further, I want to discuss what the word threshold means.

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.310
‫A threshold is a level rate or amount at which something comes into effect.

13
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.110
‫That's the official definition.

14
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.230
‫Thresholds are commonly used for a lot of things.

15
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.710
‫For example, a speed limit is considered a threshold.

16
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.410
‫If a sign says you can't drive faster than 60 miles per hour, the threshold will be 60.

17
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.400
‫Going faster than 60 miles per hour will result in a ticket.

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.320
‫Another common example is a grading system in America.

19
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.530
‫If you score a ninety three or more on a test, you will receive an A 93 is considered a threshold.

20
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.400
‫The quantize quintile and threshold scales will create thresholds based on the data you feed them.

21
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.540
‫The difference between the scales is how thresholds are determines.

22
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.070
‫The quantize scale will set the thresholds based on the data.

23
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.200
‫It will divide the range of the input domain by the number of buckets in the output range.

24
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.800
‫The quintiles scaled will set these thresholds based on the data and the number of items in the array.

25
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.830
‫It will always make sure the data is evenly distributed in the buckets with both scales.

26
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.500
‫We didn't have a say in what the thresholds are.

27
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.770
‫D three calculated the thresholds for us.

28
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.230
‫In some cases we may need to set the thresholds ourselves.

29
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.180
‫This is where the threshold scale comes into play.

30
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.860
‫D3 will not create the thresholds for us with the threshold scale.

31
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.990
‫We need to provide the thresholds.

32
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.960
‫When we generate the scale, it gives us complete control over how data is distributed in two different

33
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.590
‫buckets.

34
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.330
‫Let's look at how we going to use the threshold scale.

35
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.440
‫The first thing we need to ask ourselves is what will the thresholds be for each class?

36
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.920
‫According to a study back in twenty sixteen, you are considered lower class if you make less than forty

37
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.890
‫five thousand two hundred dollars a year, if you make between forty five thousand two hundred dollars

38
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.200
‫and one hundred and thirty five thousand six hundred dollars a year, you are in the middle class.

39
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.260
‫And lastly, if you make more than one hundred and thirty five thousand six hundred dollars a year,

40
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.120
‫you are in the upper class.

41
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.760
‫Realistically, these numbers can vary based on where you live and how large your household is.

42
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.500
‫For the sake of simplicity, we will assume these numbers work for our data set.

43
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.690
‫The threshold scale requires we provide at these thresholds as the domain.

44
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.630
‫We aren't giving it our data.

45
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.170
‫After providing these thresholds, we can move on to setting the range.

46
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.130
‫The range is the list of colours we want to transform the data to.

47
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.810
‫This doesn't change.

48
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.730
‫D3 will distribute the data based on the thresholds in the input domain.

49
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.870
‫As a side note, we are not limited to two thresholds.

50
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.710
‫We can provide as many thresholds as we want.

51
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.870
‫Typically you will have one less threshold.

52
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.160
‫Then you have buckets.

53
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.920
‫For example, we have three colors.

54
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.040
‫Therefore we will have two thresholds.

55
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.380
‫D three will use the first threshold for the first bucket, which is the color white.

56
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.270
‫If a value falls below the first threshold, it'll be put into this bucket.

57
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.090
‫The first and second threshold will be used for the second bucket, which is the color pink.

58
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.340
‫If a value falls between the two thresholds, it'll be put into this bucket.

59
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.590
‫The second threshold will be used for the third bucket, which is the color red.

60
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.320
‫If a value is above this threshold, it'll be put into this bucket.

61
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.730
‫Notice how the data is distributed.

62
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.310
‫The first bucket will always be tied to the first threshold and the last bucket will be tied to the

63
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.360
‫last threshold.

64
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.130
‫The buckets in between will be based on values in between two thresholds.

65
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.960
‫Let's try using the threshold scale in practice, we will add a new element for containing the heat

66
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.340
‫map.

67
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.000
‫We will copy the H1 and div tags from a previous heat map.

68
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.830
‫The text for the H1 tag will be the following threshold scale.

69
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.630
‫The ID of the div tag will be changed to heat map for.

70
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.740
‫Next, let's update Descript script file.

71
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.370
‫At the bottom of the script, we are going to call the draw function a fourth time, the idea of the

72
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.600
‫element is heat map for the name of the scale will be threshold.

73
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.130
‫The last thing we need to do is update the draw function with the threshold scale inside the function

74
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.370
‫search for where we created the conditional blocks, we will add a new conditional block with the IF

75
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.000
‫statement.

76
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.800
‫The condition will check if the scale argument is equal to threshold.

77
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.410
‫If it is, we will assign the color scale variable to the D 3.0 scale threshold function.

78
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.480
‫Our scale needs the domain and range first, the domain, we will chain the domain method.

79
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.620
‫The domain will be an array of thresholds we are going to pass in an array with two numbers, which

80
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.240
‫are forty five thousand two hundred and one hundred and thirty five thousand six hundred.

81
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.700
‫Next, you will add the output range by changing the range function.

82
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.130
‫The range will be an array of colors we want the data to be transformed to, we will add the colors

83
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.990
‫white, pink and red.

84
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.280
‫We're finished.

85
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.810
‫Let's refresh the page.

86
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.520
‫The chart is being drawn at the bottom of the page, the scale has successfully transformed the data

87
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.460
‫into colors.

88
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.710
‫We have a total of four heat maps, each telling a different story.

89
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.510
‫In the next lecture, we will discuss the differences between them.
