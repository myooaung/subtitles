00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,770
‫In this lecture, we're going to update the chart based on the user's selection.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,120
‫This is where things are going to get tricky.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,990
‫We have to decide what gets updated and what doesn't get updated.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,760
‫For example, if we scroll to the top of the function, we're making a request for the file.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,140
‫We don't need to repeat this request.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,350
‫Every time we change metrics, we only need the data.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,440
‫Once there are other parts we'll need to update, such as the scales, we are going to move.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,290
‫The things that need to be updated into the histogram function code that doesn't need to be repeated

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,070
‫will remain where it's been written.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,150
‫We'll start from the top and work our way down after performing a request for a file.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,640
‫We are creating some accessor functions.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,000
‫The accessor functions will need to change based on the current metric, their functions that will tell

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,690
‫D three which properties it should use for drawing the charge.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,330
‫We will cut both accessor functions.

15
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,250
‫Next, we will paste them into the histogram function.

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:12,380
‫The accessor functions will need to be updated specifically, the accessor function will need to be

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,200
‫told which metric to return.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,260
‫We have an argument in the histogram function called Metrick.

19
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,610
‫We can use this argument to help our accessor.

20
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,910
‫We will return the following the DOT currently metrick.

21
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,390
‫The metrics can be found under the currently object where accessing the property with the help of the

22
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,890
‫metric argument, our accessors already.

23
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,180
‫Let's go back to the top of the file.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,400
‫The next thing we'll find is the dimensions, the dimensions do not rely on the data, we can leave

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:56,560
‫them in place after the dimensions we are creating to selections there, the SPG and container selections.

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,280
‫These selections don't need to be moved.

27
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,860
‫They don't rely on the data to be drawn.

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,720
‫We will leave them alone afterward.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,160
‫We have our scales.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,840
‫These scales rely on the data they need to be moved.

31
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,940
‫We're going to cut everything under the scales section.

32
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,110
‫Then in the histogram function, we will paste in the code.

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,900
‫Let's scroll back up to the next section.

34
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,670
‫After the scales, the bars are being drawn with their labels, these drawings are dynamic, we will

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,400
‫need to move them over to the histogram function.

36
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,390
‫Scrolling back up, there's one last section for the access, the code for the access will also need

37
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,140
‫to be moved.

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,290
‫That's about it.

39
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,520
‫We don't need to adjust the other pieces of code, most of the code relies on the accessor functions

40
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,340
‫by updating the accessor functions alone.

41
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,620
‫Everything else will update accordingly.

42
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,930
‫There's one last thing we need to do.

43
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,080
‫The histogram will never appear because the histogram function is never called at the bottom of the

44
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,050
‫draw function.

45
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,230
‫We will call the histogram function.

46
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,230
‫We will need to tell the function which metric it should draw.

47
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,080
‫We are going to use the metric we used last time, which was the humidity.

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,690
‫Let's try testing the application.

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,250
‫The histogram will continue to work.

50
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:52,470
‫We will see the bar's labels and access if we look inside the Council of the developer tools, we aren't

51
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,360
‫receiving airs here either.

52
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,910
‫Let's try changing the metrics with the dropdown.

53
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,990
‫The bars are changing, but you'll notice a problem immediately, there are labels all over the place.

54
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,070
‫Also, the axis is broken.

55
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,830
‫The console is not reporting any errors.

56
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,480
‫So what's the problem to understand what's going on?

57
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,820
‫Let's check out the elements panel and the developer tools.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,490
‫We will inspect the SPG image.

59
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,730
‫We will find the rectangles and a set of groups, several groups are appearing in the image in our code,

60
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,190
‫we're drawing the groups before adding the labels and access to keep things organized.

61
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,380
‫Every time we switch to a different metric, we are adding a new group instead of overwriting the original

62
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,780
‫group.

63
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,810
‫Let's switch to our editors to find out how this is happening.

64
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,820
‫Scroll to the part of the code where we're drawing the labels, the very first thing we're doing is

65
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,080
‫spending a new group.

66
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,160
‫After making the group, we begin the process of adding labels to the group based on the data.

67
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,020
‫We are not selecting the original group at all.

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,590
‫The same thing is happening with the code for the axis.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,650
‫A new group is being added with the axis.

70
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,900
‫The original axis will remain.

71
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,290
‫This problem does not occur with the rectangles.

72
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,870
‫If we look at the code for the rectangles, we are not creating a group for them.

73
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,070
‫Instead, we're making a selection of rectangles that are present in the container selection after making

74
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,950
‫the selection.

75
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,430
‫We're joining the data to the selection.

76
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,610
‫D3 will notice there are rectangles already in the selection for the data to be joined with.

77
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,560
‫It will not draw additional rectangles if it doesn't have to.

78
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,060
‫If there are more rectangles than there are groups, it'll remove the excess rectangles.

79
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,390
‫This is why the rectangles are not having the same issues as the other parts of our chart.

80
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,330
‫The solution to our problem is to make sure we only have one group for the labels and another group

81
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,320
‫for the axis.

82
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,750
‫This way we can allow D3 to take care of deciding whether to remove or add new shapes.

83
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,130
‫Here's how we'll fix this issue.

84
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,910
‫We are going to create the groups before we draw the histogram.

85
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,130
‫Then in our histogram function will draw the labels and axis in their respective groups.

86
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,790
‫D three will be able to handle the rest.

87
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,690
‫We'll start with the labels.

88
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,370
‫We are going to cut the two lines where we create the group and class.

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,700
‫Then we will paste this code above the histogram function.

90
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,140
‫We will store the selection in a variable called Labels Group.

91
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,300
‫Next, we will go back to where we previously cut the code.

92
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,040
‫We will replace the code with the labels group selection.

93
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,690
‫By using the same group, these three will be aware that there are text elements the data can be joined

94
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,980
‫to, it'll remove or add elements based on how many groups and elements there are.

95
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,080
‫We won't have to worry about excess labels.

96
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,820
‫The next thing we'll tackle is the access.

97
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,130
‫We are adding the access to a selection called X Access Group.

98
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,330
‫Let's cut this entire variable.

99
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,570
‫We will paste it above the histogram function.

100
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,010
‫We're finished.

101
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,490
‫Let's refresh the page.

102
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,380
‫This time, if we were to switch to different metrics, the histogram updates without a problem.

103
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,730
‫Fantastic, the issues are gone.

104
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,690
‫The problem we encountered stresses the importance of groups by storing a group of shapes in separate

105
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,170
‫groups.

106
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,790
‫We can update the shapes inside them in the next lecture.

107
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,020
‫We'll continue working on the histogram.

108
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,250
‫I'll see you there.
