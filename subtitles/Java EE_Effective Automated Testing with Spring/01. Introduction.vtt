00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Hey, this is Billy with Pluralsight,

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.805
and we're looking at how to write effective automated tests with Spring.

3
00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:07.780
In this course,

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.614
we have looked at how to write code and make it easier to test using

5
00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:14.045
tools provided by Spring to make testing easier,

6
00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:17.164
and some recently developed tools to help with integration testing.

7
00:00:17.164 --> 00:00:20.233
In this module, we'll take a look at some tools,

8
00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.819
both within the Spring ecosystem and beyond,

9
00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.939
that can help make tests easier to write,

10
00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.156
read, as well as produce more useful documentation.

11
00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:33.790
Our agenda for this module will be using tests as documentation,

12
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.697
both how to write tests that other developers can easily read,

13
00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:42.169
as well as how tests can be used to directly produce documentation for a system.

14
00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:45.962
We will review acceptance testing using behavior-driven development,

15
00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:50.360
or BDD, and how it can help both when developing an application,

16
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.785
as well as how it can document a system as we write it.

17
00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:56.782
This will also include a demo on BDD in action.

18
00:00:56.782 --> 00:00:59.747
We'll also have some demos of tools and practices for

19
00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.095
writing descriptive and readable tests,

20
00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:09.000
as well as demoing tools that can be used to directly generate documentation from the test we write.
