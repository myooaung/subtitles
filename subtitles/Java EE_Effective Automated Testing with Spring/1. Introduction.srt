00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
Hey, this is Billy with Pluralsight,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,837
and we are looking at how to write effective automated tests with Spring.

3
00:00:07,837 --> 00:00:08,734
So far in this course,

4
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:11,992
we have been learning about how to structure our code to make it easier to test,

5
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:14,199
and learning how to effectively unit test our code.

6
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:17,710
Now we're going to go a little bit deeper and start testing some of

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,140
the more difficult areas of our code to get into,

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,025
such as security testing, how our application handles JSON,

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,908
or if we are using aspects, for example,

10
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:29,350
to help with logging.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,081
Luckily for us,

12
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,274
Spring provides a lot of excellent tools for testing

13
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:33,612
these parts of our application,

14
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:38,893
and we're going to be learning about them in this module.

15
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:42,775
Our agenda for this module will be defining component integration testing,

16
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:47,400
what are its goals, and what separates it from unit testing.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,327
Using Spring and Spring Boot testing utilities,

18
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:53,757
we will take a look at testing several different layers of our

19
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:56,922
application including testing our RESTful APIs,

20
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:00,935
testing the data layer, and security testing.

21
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:09,000
We will also look at how to test JSON marshalling and unmarshalling, and testing aspects as well.
