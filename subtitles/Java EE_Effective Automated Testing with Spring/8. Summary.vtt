00:00:02.594 --> 00:00:03.410
During this module,

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.874
we covered how to and why component tests with Spring Boot application.

3
00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:09.814
When writing automated tests for the projects we support,

4
00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:12.532
it is important we also test how our application

5
00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:15.172
interacts with the libraries it depends upon.

6
00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:18.901
Doing so allows us to upgrade library dependencies with confidence,

7
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:22.075
allowing us to take advantage of the latest features in a library,

8
00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:24.220
and makes sure your application remains secure by

9
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.227
bringing in the latest security passes.

10
00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:27.430
During this module,

11
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.228
we also covered many of the tools the Spring Boot team has created

12
00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:34.672
to make testing Spring Boot applications easier.

13
00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:35.570
In this course,

14
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.000
we will continue exploring writing automated tests to see how an application interacts with external systems.
