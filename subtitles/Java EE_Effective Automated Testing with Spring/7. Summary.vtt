00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:03.280
In this module,

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.877
we covered that the key characteristics of a unit

3
00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:10.752
test are they run in isolation, they verify business behavior,

4
00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:13.906
and that unit tests, and really all automated tests,

5
00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:16.075
should only verify a single scenario.

6
00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:18.996
We also covered the various types of mocks,

7
00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:22.710
when and where each type of mock should be used,

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.607
and how mocks can be used to write more effective automated tests.

9
00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:26.954
Finally,

10
00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:31.012
we learned about the test-driven development process and how it can help guide

11
00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:39.000
the development process so that the code written is more testable and that developers can refactor their code with confidence.
