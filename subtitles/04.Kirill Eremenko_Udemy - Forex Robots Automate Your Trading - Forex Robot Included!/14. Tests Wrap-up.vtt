Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.660  -->  00:00:15.810
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditator for introducer Tauriel we will

3

00:00:15.810  -->  00:00:18.600
wrap up the practical section of the course.

4

00:00:18.610  -->  00:00:27.210
There are five main areas relating to testing and optimization of Robert in preparation to launch it

5

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:29.930
on a large scale real account.

6

00:00:30.030  -->  00:00:36.990
And today I wanted to briefly touch on each of them and give you three main points for each one that

7

00:00:36.990  -->  00:00:42.450
you could take away from this course for your own future testing and optimizations.

8

00:00:42.450  -->  00:00:50.130
So the main five areas are optimisation and backtesting forward tests demo tests real tests and rolling

9

00:00:50.130  -->  00:00:51.120
optimization.

10

00:00:51.150  -->  00:00:57.300
So let's have a look at each one of them in more detail optimization and backtesting.

11

00:00:57.480  -->  00:01:06.750
This bit was the first part that we did in this section and as you remember we optimized our expert

12

00:01:06.750  -->  00:01:13.590
Yser we had so many different sets of parameters that we can look through them all through all of them

13

00:01:13.590  -->  00:01:16.270
so we had to pick out the ones that we liked the most.

14

00:01:16.290  -->  00:01:24.300
So the main three key takeaways takeaways here are that the more sets you pick out from this part of

15

00:01:25.470  -->  00:01:30.810
the preparation process the better because then you'll be able to filter them out and pick out the best

16

00:01:30.810  -->  00:01:32.160
ones out of the ones you pick.

17

00:01:32.160  -->  00:01:35.600
Now of course the more set to pick the more work you'll have to do.

18

00:01:35.610  -->  00:01:41.340
But it also increases your choice and likelihood of picking out a really good set.

19

00:01:41.340  -->  00:01:44.520
Also don't forget to check the results on a graph.

20

00:01:44.520  -->  00:01:49.220
So once you've got the optimization results don't just look for the highest profit or the lowest drawdown

21

00:01:49.230  -->  00:01:49.380
.

22

00:01:49.380  -->  00:01:54.180
Also make sure that you always run the back test for each one of the ones that you want to pick out

23

00:01:54.210  -->  00:02:00.060
and look at the graph because the graph will tell you much more than the stats can and will help you

24

00:02:00.060  -->  00:02:03.120
pick out the sets that you're actually comfortable with.

25

00:02:03.120  -->  00:02:04.730
And finally be creative.

26

00:02:04.740  -->  00:02:09.270
Remember how we picked out our sets when only looking for the highest profit.

27

00:02:09.270  -->  00:02:15.390
We looked at the highest profit and then we tried to mix up the different types of start hours and we

28

00:02:15.390  -->  00:02:23.970
looked for low drawdown so don't be afraid to dive deep into your optimization results and see what

29

00:02:23.970  -->  00:02:25.320
you can find there.

30

00:02:25.380  -->  00:02:26.270
Forward tests.

31

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:29.780
Three main key takeaways here are avoid curve fitting.

32

00:02:29.790  -->  00:02:35.090
So the forward test is designed to help you to avoid curve fitting you optimize on this.

33

00:02:35.090  -->  00:02:42.450
For example three months and then use next month argue statical daughter to run a forward test and that

34

00:02:42.450  -->  00:02:49.650
helps you make sure that you're not just fitting your expert visor to make profit on that particular

35

00:02:51.150  -->  00:02:53.240
period of time where you run optimization.

36

00:02:53.250  -->  00:03:00.870
The forward test is like a an additional verification process to make sure that you avoid it for a curve

37

00:03:00.870  -->  00:03:01.200
fitting.

38

00:03:01.200  -->  00:03:05.800
And as you recall we did have results that were good on optimization.

39

00:03:05.800  -->  00:03:13.470
All of the factors but you were very poor on those tests performed very poorly on the four tests and

40

00:03:13.470  -->  00:03:18.520
we with that they would curve fitting test sets and we had to get rid of them.

41

00:03:18.690  -->  00:03:20.020
Next eliminate duplicate.

42

00:03:20.040  -->  00:03:28.260
If you have very similar sets that have similar balance graphs in their back tests then you don't wouldn't

43

00:03:28.290  -->  00:03:35.640
probably want to move on with ball for those sets onto a demo test because they will be very ill have

44

00:03:35.640  -->  00:03:36.620
similar results.

45

00:03:36.640  -->  00:03:41.760
Like remember we had two sets that had the our starting our 9.

46

00:03:41.790  -->  00:03:46.710
Their results were very similar so that means that you kind of doubling your risks if you launch both

47

00:03:46.710  -->  00:03:51.840
of them on a real account because they will probably have drawdowns at the same time and that means

48

00:03:51.840  -->  00:03:54.630
your account will have a double double drawdown.

49

00:03:54.720  -->  00:03:59.010
So try to eliminate those in the forward test and finally be generous.

50

00:03:59.080  -->  00:04:08.070
Forward test is not a stage of your preparation process where you would want to eliminate as many sets

51

00:04:08.070  -->  00:04:08.550
as you can.

52

00:04:08.550  -->  00:04:13.890
No you just want to eliminate the duplicate ones and the ones that are obviously curve fit it.

53

00:04:13.890  -->  00:04:20.160
The rest you can move on to the demo test and see how they go there so as long as the set kind of holds

54

00:04:20.490  -->  00:04:26.430
its own during the forward test as long as it's not rapidly losing money you might want to move that

55

00:04:26.430  -->  00:04:31.830
one to a demo test and see how it performs their demo test.

56

00:04:31.830  -->  00:04:33.280
Three main key takeaways.

57

00:04:33.570  -->  00:04:40.010
Lenth the depends on system and that's that's a very valid point that if you're running an expert wise

58

00:04:40.020  -->  00:04:45.660
on the fifteen minute chart then you might even have like 5 trades per day and say one week of tests

59

00:04:45.660  -->  00:04:51.970
will give you 25 trades and that might be sufficient for you or two weeks of trades will you 50 fifty

60

00:04:52.230  -->  00:04:59.730
two weeks of testing will give you 50 trades and that that can be sufficient for you to evaluate this

61

00:04:59.730  -->  00:05:00.930
particular set.

62

00:05:01.140  -->  00:05:06.120
Whereas if your test if your expert was running on the hour each hour like we had or even on the daily

63

00:05:06.120  -->  00:05:11.670
chart then you can have as low as a couple of trades a week and then you would need to run your test

64

00:05:11.670  -->  00:05:19.110
for a month or two on the demarc and just to be able to have sufficient a sufficient number of observations

65

00:05:19.140  -->  00:05:23.550
to eliminate or approve a certain set.

66

00:05:23.660  -->  00:05:28.700
So it really depends on the system but my general advice is that don't run a demo test for less than

67

00:05:28.700  -->  00:05:36.170
a week because you at least want to see how your expert advice behaves in different market conditions

68

00:05:36.170  -->  00:05:42.860
that occur through the daily cycle of night and day and when markets open and close and also how it

69

00:05:42.860  -->  00:05:48.230
works on different days of the week or closer to the weekend and in the midweek and so on.

70

00:05:48.620  -->  00:05:55.880
And generally also don't run the demo test for too long because sometimes especially you have a shorter

71

00:05:55.880  -->  00:06:01.880
period or expert advisers working on shorter time frames you will notice that the market conditions

72

00:06:01.880  -->  00:06:07.830
can change and that will be like if you're running dimittis for a month.

73

00:06:08.030  -->  00:06:12.590
Then what was at the start of the month and what is at the end or if you're running for like three months

74

00:06:12.590  -->  00:06:13.010
.

75

00:06:13.010  -->  00:06:15.020
What is at the end of your test period.

76

00:06:15.020  -->  00:06:16.780
The market can actually be different.

77

00:06:16.790  -->  00:06:22.030
And your expert adviser said might start underperforming by then.

78

00:06:22.080  -->  00:06:25.780
So just it's a it's your judgment call.

79

00:06:25.790  -->  00:06:26.980
How long to run your test.

80

00:06:26.990  -->  00:06:31.140
Don't don't run for less than a week and don't run it for too long.

81

00:06:31.190  -->  00:06:34.450
That will allow the market to change.

82

00:06:34.460  -->  00:06:39.300
Run multiple Tessman Tennessee as you saw we were on four demo tests at the same time.

83

00:06:39.380  -->  00:06:45.140
Very convenient because it's more efficient you can run up to 8 10 as many as you want because that

84

00:06:45.140  -->  00:06:51.650
way you are actually you can compare them between each other and you're more efficient in the sense

85

00:06:51.650  -->  00:06:58.940
that you don't have to if something if a demo test fails for said is underperforming you don't have

86

00:06:58.940  -->  00:07:00.890
to restart the whole thing for a different set.

87

00:07:00.890  -->  00:07:06.200
You really have other sites running so you can just get rid of the underperforming sets along the way

88

00:07:06.200  -->  00:07:10.320
and you at the end you'll have the best performing ones and be strict.

89

00:07:10.700  -->  00:07:17.060
Anything that comes out of the test is going on you know real money account or a small real account

90

00:07:17.090  -->  00:07:23.710
for further testing and that's actually a real money and you don't want to be fooling around with unprofitable

91

00:07:23.830  -->  00:07:26.360
like sets that you know that aren't profitable.

92

00:07:26.390  -->  00:07:31.730
So if something's underperforming on them and just get rid of it don't don't even try taking it to the

93

00:07:31.730  -->  00:07:35.380
next step real test.

94

00:07:35.420  -->  00:07:37.780
So it's a real mini test.

95

00:07:37.880  -->  00:07:43.880
You have to do this for every broker and account type So whenever you change your broker or you change

96

00:07:43.880  -->  00:07:50.090
that even that accountable for when one broker you have to first of all check your follow back test

97

00:07:50.080  -->  00:07:53.730
and for tests like we did just to make sure that they are more or less aligned for you.

98

00:07:53.780  -->  00:08:02.270
On the demo count and also you need to run this mini real test because the real market conditions can

99

00:08:02.270  -->  00:08:07.190
be very different to what you were used to when your previous broker or an account or account.

100

00:08:07.370  -->  00:08:17.600
And that can impact your ability of your spirit wise and you don't want to uncover that on a large scale

101

00:08:17.610  -->  00:08:21.590
real account you want to see if that is the case you want to see it on a small account so that your

102

00:08:21.590  -->  00:08:25.160
losses are minimized and just on that as well.

103

00:08:25.190  -->  00:08:31.670
Trading is always risky especially trading of expert Wise's is a risky process.

104

00:08:31.790  -->  00:08:39.110
But by doing all of these steps by doing optimizations forward test back tests and demo tests and many

105

00:08:39.110  -->  00:08:47.540
real contests you are performing a due diligence process you are making sure that you're undergoing

106

00:08:48.110  -->  00:08:53.450
all of the steps that you can possibly undergo to minimize your risks.

107

00:08:53.480  -->  00:09:02.240
And that way you're filtering out the sets for your expert Yser that are unprofitable and that are that

108

00:09:02.240  -->  00:09:05.510
can impact negatively your account.

109

00:09:05.510  -->  00:09:12.020
That way you kind of by going through the due diligence process you are making sure that you've done

110

00:09:12.110  -->  00:09:19.400
everything you possibly could and that where you're minimizing the risks substantially and also you've

111

00:09:19.400  -->  00:09:21.020
got a clear conscious that

112

00:09:23.800  -->  00:09:27.240
there is a very low likelihood of something going on.

113

00:09:27.240  -->  00:09:29.980
There still is because it's a risky process trading.

114

00:09:30.230  -->  00:09:35.570
But at least you've done everything you could so just make sure you do go through this through all of

115

00:09:35.570  -->  00:09:40.930
these steps every time you change a broker or an account type parallel testing.

116

00:09:41.090  -->  00:09:45.020
That is something that we saw in this section of the course.

117

00:09:45.080  -->  00:09:50.990
That's when you run your a real test in parallel to your demo test and that is actually a good thing

118

00:09:50.990  -->  00:09:56.240
because you can compare as they go and you can see where the discrepancies are in real time.

119

00:09:56.240  -->  00:10:01.990
You can see that on your tests certain trades have been opened and on your real test or not.

120

00:10:02.000  -->  00:10:09.890
And that can maybe give you extra ideas of why it's happening and maybe give you raise some red flags

121

00:10:09.950  -->  00:10:11.570
about this real account.

122

00:10:11.660  -->  00:10:17.090
On the other hand you will see that everything is very similar and that means everything should be good

123

00:10:17.090  -->  00:10:17.690
.

124

00:10:17.750  -->  00:10:21.170
And finally in your real test you don't just be strict.

125

00:10:21.170  -->  00:10:23.790
Be very picky and ruthless about the results.

126

00:10:23.810  -->  00:10:29.130
If something's underperforming and your real test do not take it to the next level to the large scale

127

00:10:29.130  -->  00:10:34.910
a real account.  if you're not happy with something even in the slightest manner I would advise against

128

00:10:34.910  -->  00:10:40.430
taking it further because when you take something to a large scale real account the game is on you are

129

00:10:40.430  -->  00:10:47.300
trading big money and especially if that's not your money you don't want systems that you're not confident

130

00:10:47.300  -->  00:10:48.900
in trading there.

131

00:10:48.950  -->  00:10:53.840
You always have to have a clear conscience and you have to be able to say to yourself that you've done

132

00:10:53.840  -->  00:10:58.310
that you diligence process and that you've you're happy with the systems that are trading and that will

133

00:10:58.310  -->  00:11:00.500
help you sleep better at night when it froze.

134

00:11:00.500  -->  00:11:03.310
Robots are making money for you.

135

00:11:03.590  -->  00:11:06.040
And finally rolling optimization.

136

00:11:06.050  -->  00:11:09.240
So this is something that we haven't discussed yet.

137

00:11:09.380  -->  00:11:12.660
The main concept behind it is that nothing last forever.

138

00:11:12.980  -->  00:11:19.640
There is no expert adviser or no set out there in the world that will always make money.

139

00:11:19.640  -->  00:11:23.540
The market's always changing the market's dynamic conditions are changing.

140

00:11:23.690  -->  00:11:27.210
Governments are changing their regulations doing interventions.

141

00:11:27.230  -->  00:11:28.890
Everything is changing all the time.

142

00:11:29.120  -->  00:11:34.330
So you have to constantly adapt to the market your systems you have to adapt your trading systems and

143

00:11:34.340  -->  00:11:37.330
market and inch in.

144

00:11:37.520  -->  00:11:45.170
In a nutshell that means that you want to make sure that while you're externalizes are trading on your

145

00:11:45.170  -->  00:11:53.300
life scale real account in the back like in the background you're still running rerunning optimizations

146

00:11:53.300  -->  00:11:58.730
once in a while maybe once a week maybe once once a month you rerun your optimization you see if there

147

00:11:58.730  -->  00:12:02.840
if you said it has been performing well fits.

148

00:12:03.060  -->  00:12:07.340
If it's underperforming if it's if there's a way to improve it if it is there's a better set and so

149

00:12:07.340  -->  00:12:07.940
on.

150

00:12:07.940  -->  00:12:13.400
So we'll talk in more detail about this in the next section of the course but there is just something

151

00:12:13.400  -->  00:12:19.550
to note that nothing lasts forever and you have to be prepared that sooner or later you will have to

152

00:12:19.620  -->  00:12:25.250
really optimize your expert advisors or maybe even change your expert Wise's or change the sets and

153

00:12:25.370  -->  00:12:26.480
so on.

154

00:12:26.480  -->  00:12:30.290
So that's all for today I hope you enjoyed this section.

155

00:12:30.320  -->  00:12:35.750
On the practical side of things I think we achieved some outstanding results we're far demo tests and

156

00:12:35.750  -->  00:12:37.420
even real tests.

157

00:12:37.610  -->  00:12:44.280
And I look forward to seeing in the next section of the course until then happy trading.
