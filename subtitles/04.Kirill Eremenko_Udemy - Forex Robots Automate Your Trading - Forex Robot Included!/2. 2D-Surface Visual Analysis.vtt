00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:09.510
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:14.080
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in metatrader 4.

3

00:00:14.960  -->  00:00:19.060
In the previous tutorial we talked about setting limitations for Europe to position.

4

00:00:19.110  -->  00:00:24.320
And today we will talk about the two dimensional surface analysis.

5

00:00:24.320  -->  00:00:31.590
Here I have the optimization settings open for our expert was a simple system version 5.0 and I still

6

00:00:31.590  -->  00:00:33.270
have this window from last time.

7

00:00:33.510  -->  00:00:39.090
So here I'll just uncheck the Maxim or drill down and just click reset so we don't have that interfering

8

00:00:39.090  -->  00:00:45.160
with today's tutorial and they'll just click OK to save that and go back and text properties.

9

00:00:45.400  -->  00:00:51.620
Now if we go to inputs we already have the take profit's set to optimize between 10 and 100 and stop

10

00:00:51.620  -->  00:00:54.270
loss Tilse optimize between 10 or 100.

11

00:00:54.360  -->  00:01:00.540
And I'll remind you that this is for that one very good set of parameters that we saw in the demo test

12

00:01:00.540  -->  00:01:00.600
.

13

00:01:00.600  -->  00:01:07.350
Now what we will do is we'll run this optimization as it is and we should see 100 results.

14

00:01:07.350  -->  00:01:13.020
There we go there was a 100 back test that were run in fact less than 1 second.

15

00:01:13.050  -->  00:01:21.840
So if we go to optimization resolves we'll see that there's a 100 here and also we can sort them by

16

00:01:21.840  -->  00:01:25.930
profit and we'll see the most profitable one up here.

17

00:01:26.160  -->  00:01:32.190
But what we are interested today in todays optimization graph so let's go ahead and select that as you

18

00:01:32.190  -->  00:01:40.320
can see here you have these 100 trade 100 BAC tests ordered by They're always on this graph are always

19

00:01:40.320  -->  00:01:47.100
ordered by their run and so up here we see the most profitable one if you bring your Mosse up here you'll

20

00:01:47.460  -->  00:01:53.700
It will pop up of take profit 20 stop loss 50 goes with the optimize parameters and that is the best

21

00:01:53.700  -->  00:01:54.200
one.

22

00:01:54.450  -->  00:02:03.180
However this chart may not be the most visually effective in terms of our data analysis and visualization

23

00:02:03.480  -->  00:02:09.210
and that's why a trade or for has an inbuilt functionality to allow you to visualize these results better

24

00:02:09.210  -->  00:02:09.470
.

25

00:02:09.480  -->  00:02:16.380
So if you right click on this chart and you select to the surface analysis you will see something like

26

00:02:16.380  -->  00:02:17.220
this.

27

00:02:17.250  -->  00:02:24.860
And so what this does is it chooses two parameters from the optimization in this case take Providence

28

00:02:24.960  -->  00:02:28.660
Stop-Loss and places them on the two axes.

29

00:02:28.740  -->  00:02:34.420
Right now on the x axis axes you have take profit on the y axes you have stop loss.

30

00:02:34.560  -->  00:02:41.610
And so here is this is your take profit and this is your stop loss up here.

31

00:02:41.610  -->  00:02:53.070
Each square represents a set of parameters with which you can find out which ones they are by just intersecting

32

00:02:53.130  -->  00:03:00.840
the x and y axes so for example this one here is got take profits 30 and still plus 40 like the Pop-Pop

33

00:03:00.990  -->  00:03:07.810
shows us and that is also correct if we take this 30 and we intersect with this 40 or here.

34

00:03:08.100  -->  00:03:15.150
This line this line that you'll get this square here which means take profit Sturnus topless for it

35

00:03:15.160  -->  00:03:15.420
.

36

00:03:15.630  -->  00:03:22.830
But it is very visually appealing and more representative than the previous chart because the darkness

37

00:03:22.830  -->  00:03:29.310
or the shade of each block shows you how profitable that particular back test was.

38

00:03:29.310  -->  00:03:33.340
So for example this back test has the darkest color.

39

00:03:33.450  -->  00:03:35.640
And that means it was the most profitable.

40

00:03:35.670  -->  00:03:40.010
And here it says run 42 take profit 20 stop loss 50.

41

00:03:40.080  -->  00:03:45.690
And if we go to the optimization results the most profitable trade back to us here is take profit 21

42

00:03:45.690  -->  00:03:46.960
stop loss 50.

43

00:03:46.980  -->  00:03:52.950
So that's basically what it means that the darker the color the more profitable right away you can see

44

00:03:52.950  -->  00:03:59.910
here that all of these results where Stop-Loss was 50 up to 100.

45

00:03:59.970  -->  00:04:02.390
They were the most profitable ones.

46

00:04:02.470  -->  00:04:07.980
And but at the same time take the take profit had to always be 20 pips.

47

00:04:07.980  -->  00:04:17.010
So that's something you have to notice if you go left or right from that take profit return drops quite

48

00:04:17.010  -->  00:04:18.270
quickly.

49

00:04:18.270  -->  00:04:26.010
Also you can see from this chart that this area of squares was quite profitable so if you take profit

50

00:04:26.010  -->  00:04:33.780
is between 40 and 80 and your stop loss is between 50 and 100 then you will you're likely to have profitable

51

00:04:33.780  -->  00:04:36.140
results in these tests.

52

00:04:36.450  -->  00:04:44.340
And conversely you can see this light shaded line which is quite interesting because if your stop loss

53

00:04:44.760  -->  00:04:52.770
is between is actually equal to 20 then you're more likely to have losses and that isn't even the case

54

00:04:52.770  -->  00:04:54.450
when you stop loss is equal to 10.

55

00:04:54.450  -->  00:04:58.290
So this is quite an anomaly which is interesting to observe.

56

00:04:58.500  -->  00:05:04.740
So what are we going to do now is we're going to ask for as first as a first step will increase the

57

00:05:04.740  -->  00:05:11.790
number of steps so let's say instead of doing a step 10 step or five and see how that affects our Chuck

58

00:05:12.290  -->  00:05:18.100
So click OK and we'll start optimization now and then we'll go to possess Grof.

59

00:05:18.630  -->  00:05:22.980
As you can see here the number of steps has increased.

60

00:05:22.990  -->  00:05:27.330
Don't just try to make this a bit bigger so we can see better.

61

00:05:27.420  -->  00:05:35.570
So you can see here that there is now much more blocks but we still see a similar pattern here here

62

00:05:35.610  -->  00:05:37.880
we have profitable trades also in this.

63

00:05:38.130  -->  00:05:42.070
Maybe triangle or the square we have more profitable trades.

64

00:05:42.390  -->  00:05:44.690
And then we have this white line here.

65

00:05:44.820  -->  00:05:48.480
So that's also quite an interesting observation.

66

00:05:48.510  -->  00:05:53.910
You can still use the tiddy two dimensional surface for analysis here and if you have more than two

67

00:05:53.910  -->  00:06:01.800
parameters so let's add the min limit into this mix and let's optimize it between 0 and 10 or a step

68

00:06:01.800  -->  00:06:04.200
of one click OK and we'll kick start.

69

00:06:04.500  -->  00:06:08.420
So this did take a little bit longer because we do have a bit more back to.

70

00:06:08.430  -->  00:06:09.560
I had to be run.

71

00:06:10.050  -->  00:06:17.510
But you know if you go to the optimization chart you'll see that at the bottom you said different axes

72

00:06:17.520  -->  00:06:23.100
and that's because the X-axis is now the min Pip limit and the y axis is take profits so let's return

73

00:06:23.100  -->  00:06:25.570
them waxes to Stop-Loss which we're used to.

74

00:06:25.680  -->  00:06:28.500
And the x axes to take profit.

75

00:06:28.500  -->  00:06:31.530
And once again we see a similar picture.

76

00:06:31.680  -->  00:06:41.790
However now each block over the size of this match matrix represents not only one but a stack of BACS

77

00:06:41.790  -->  00:06:46.050
tests and the color shows you the best out of them.

78

00:06:46.050  -->  00:06:54.470
So here you will see all the back tests that had take profit 20 and topless 45 and that in reality there

79

00:06:54.480  -->  00:07:00.310
was actually 10 of them because there was 10 back tests with different MinPip limits . So MinPip limit

80

00:07:00.330  -->  00:07:02.710
was one to three and all the way up to 10.

81

00:07:02.910  -->  00:07:06.150
And for each one of those to take us 20 and 45.

82

00:07:06.180  -->  00:07:10.470
And so the caller presents the most profitable out of those 10.

83

00:07:10.470  -->  00:07:16.980
So here you can see that the most profitable those 10 has been pip pip limit to take profit 21 for take

84

00:07:17.010  -->  00:07:19.080
profit 20 and stop loss 45.

85

00:07:19.080  -->  00:07:26.160
So this kind of allows you to analyze the two variables take profit and Stop-Loss will fall out worrying

86

00:07:26.160  -->  00:07:27.540
about the other ones.

87

00:07:27.540  -->  00:07:32.880
So I'll show you another example this change the x axes from take profit to MinPip limit.

88

00:07:32.950  -->  00:07:40.950
Now on the bottom we have the the limit and on the top on the x y axis we have the stop loss so that

89

00:07:40.950  -->  00:07:46.710
allows us to analyze those two parameters against each other so contrast them without having to worry

90

00:07:46.710  -->  00:07:52.140
about the take profit to take profit is taken to account automatically by the tester it only looks at

91

00:07:52.140  -->  00:07:58.650
the Bestec profit for any combination of the limit and the stop loss and right away you can see that

92

00:07:58.650  -->  00:08:04.020
you would rather have limit somewhere between 0 and 3.

93

00:08:04.110  -->  00:08:11.940
If you can set your stop loss around 45 to 60 in this area or you can if you're able to set if you'd

94

00:08:11.940  -->  00:08:19.180
like to set your limit a bar at 10 then you should set a stop loss anywhere between 45 and 100.

95

00:08:19.200  -->  00:08:24.330
And also if you just put your mouse over any particular result will tell you the exact profit which

96

00:08:24.330  -->  00:08:26.370
is which works best with that combo.

97

00:08:26.760  -->  00:08:30.600
So that's the two dimensional surface analysis and that's how you would use it.

98

00:08:30.630  -->  00:08:36.910
It is quite handy in some circumstances when you want to contrast two variables against each other and

99

00:08:36.930  -->  00:08:41.360
see how they work best in what kind of composition.

100

00:08:41.430  -->  00:08:43.530
I think that's enough for today's tutorial.

101

00:08:43.740  -->  00:08:49.630
Next time we will discuss exploring optimization results in Excel and further analysis there.

102

00:08:49.800  -->  00:08:51.560
And I look forward to seeing you then.

103

00:08:51.660  -->  00:08:56.330
Until next time happy training.
