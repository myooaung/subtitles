00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:09,420
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,570  -->  00:00:13,390
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditative form.

3

00:00:13,590  -->  00:00:17,500
It's a turtle I'll show you how to download and install the simple system.

4

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:18,690
Expert adviser.

5

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:22,620
So to start off with We need to open our browser.

6

00:00:22,740  -->  00:00:29,080
As you can see here I've already got my browser window open on the four exposed Web site.

7

00:00:29,280  -->  00:00:35,880
We will need to go to the following address and you'll need to type that in in your browser.

8

00:00:36,140  -->  00:00:45,070
And so the address is w w w dot for X boat dot com slash simple hyphen system.

9

00:00:45,180  -->  00:00:51,510
So that's the address and if we click enter after which type that in the Brossel will take you to the

10

00:00:51,540  -->  00:00:55,020
following page as you can see here.

11

00:00:55,560  -->  00:00:58,220
This is the simple system for Strober page.

12

00:00:58,230  -->  00:01:02,280
And here you can read a little bit about the expert advisor.

13

00:01:02,370  -->  00:01:07,890
I didn't put too much information on this page because you can get all this all these insights from

14

00:01:07,890  -->  00:01:08,970
the Course itself.

15

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:15,510
And once you've read disclaimer and if you agree to it then you can download the expert was here.

16

00:01:15,660  -->  00:01:18,370
Also you'll see that there is already another version.

17

00:01:18,570  -->  00:01:23,880
So simple system version five point always the original one intended for this course have already created

18

00:01:23,880  -->  00:01:26,180
another one which is version 5.1.

19

00:01:26,190  -->  00:01:31,890
And as you'll see through this course we will be using it and there isn't much of a change I just added

20

00:01:31,890  -->  00:01:36,100
the magic number which I will explain in further tutorials.

21

00:01:36,120  -->  00:01:42,030
This just illustrates that if any more versions become available then you can always download them from

22

00:01:42,030  -->  00:01:43,590
this page.

23

00:01:43,590  -->  00:01:48,730
So now we're going to download simple system version 5.0 and installed in our bright you know metro

24

00:01:48,730  -->  00:01:49,930
area for terminal.

25

00:01:50,250  -->  00:01:59,310
So you can see here I'm already downloading it and if I open open the folder for this file here you

26

00:01:59,310  -->  00:02:00,690
can see it's a zip file.

27

00:02:00,720  -->  00:02:09,840
So what you need to do is you need to extract files them with your zip extractor and they're all available

28

00:02:09,840  -->  00:02:11,940
on any Windows system.

29

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:17,880
And here you inside the folder you see simple system version 5.0 dot Q4.

30

00:02:17,910  -->  00:02:19,650
So now we're going to go back to the terminal.

31

00:02:19,860  -->  00:02:26,160
And in order to get expert advice in here so we can see it in this tab or in strategy tester when you

32

00:02:26,160  -->  00:02:29,120
go to file and open a folder.

33

00:02:29,120  -->  00:02:38,700
So by clicking open data for the we're going to the folder where all of the data for Medicare reform

34

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:42,090
is kept for your particular user of the Windows system.

35

00:02:42,090  -->  00:02:46,630
So just be careful that this is not the installation folder.

36

00:02:46,680  -->  00:02:51,690
Therefore as you can see up here it's a completely different fault and that's because of the User Account

37

00:02:53,040  -->  00:02:54,870
Control System in Windows.

38

00:02:55,050  -->  00:03:02,730
And if you want to find out more about that and how to avoid this how to make your daughter folder equivalent

39

00:03:02,730  -->  00:03:03,420
to your

40

00:03:06,150  -->  00:03:07,090
installation folder.

41

00:03:07,090  -->  00:03:12,570
Then you need to launch first you need to launch Myntra to form portable mode and you can find out more

42

00:03:12,570  -->  00:03:17,430
about portable mode and my other course which is called Bulletproof virtual private server set up for

43

00:03:17,850  -->  00:03:19,020
algorithmic trading.

44

00:03:19,020  -->  00:03:25,490
Other than that we're in the data folder now and we need to go to M kill for a hearing to go to experts

45

00:03:25,530  -->  00:03:28,920
and we need to copy the file into this for that as you can see here.

46

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:32,530
I already have some files here I'll just get rid of them for now.

47

00:03:32,790  -->  00:03:42,120
So we want to copy our downloaded file so from here I'll just make this window it's smaller.

48

00:03:42,810  -->  00:03:47,430
So we just want to drag this file across over here and there.

49

00:03:47,580  -->  00:03:50,640
Next what we need to do is we need to restart our terminal.

50

00:03:51,060  -->  00:03:53,400
So I'm just starting my Melchor for terminal again.

51

00:03:53,610  -->  00:04:00,060
And now if we go into expert advisors you will see that simple system are in Five point.

52

00:04:00,150  -->  00:04:05,970
Is there and also it is available in the strategy tester itself.

53

00:04:06,210  -->  00:04:14,300
So that's how you get the expert adviser into your mission for a train platform and that's all for today

54

00:04:14,340  -->  00:04:14,540
.

55

00:04:14,550  -->  00:04:20,880
I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial where we will learn how to download historical data

56

00:04:20,910  -->  00:04:24,880
for the platform which will which we'll use for our testing.

57

00:04:24,900  -->  00:04:26,190
I look forward to seeing you then.

58

00:04:26,190  -->  00:04:28,610
Until next time happy training.
