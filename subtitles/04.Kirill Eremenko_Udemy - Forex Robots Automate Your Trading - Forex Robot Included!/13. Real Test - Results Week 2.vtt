00:00:07.380  -->  00:00:09.560
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.570  -->  00:00:15.320
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditator for today's tutorial.

3

00:00:15.330  -->  00:00:21.770
We will look at the results of all live real tests that we run for the simple system.

4

00:00:21.780  -->  00:00:29.960
Expert adviser so in front of me here I've got the terminal that we were running this test in and as

5

00:00:29.960  -->  00:00:34.530
I recall we had five or three expert advisers running at the same time.

6

00:00:34.530  -->  00:00:36.890
These were all simple system but with different sets.

7

00:00:36.930  -->  00:00:39.820
So I'll just ring up the calendar to show you what day it is today.

8

00:00:40.380  -->  00:00:43.540
It's the 6th of October 2014.

9

00:00:43.560  -->  00:00:48.840
And as you remember we started this real test on the 22nd of September.

10

00:00:48.900  -->  00:00:53.910
So that means that it has been running for two full weeks.

11

00:00:53.910  -->  00:01:00.230
Also you can see that I've disabled all the training and I did that as soon as the final Friday trays

12

00:01:00.300  -->  00:01:02.060
for last week were closed.

13

00:01:02.070  -->  00:01:09.180
So before we jump to the overall result let's make sure that we look at the whole of the history so

14

00:01:09.180  -->  00:01:10.390
we click on history.

15

00:01:10.590  -->  00:01:12.620
And now we're going to drag.

16

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:17.470
I've opened another chart here before an expert wise and we're going to drag all of our trade.

17

00:01:17.500  -->  00:01:21.070
So drag one trade click shift and drag it onto the chart.

18

00:01:21.370  -->  00:01:26.160
Actually you need to click shift before you start dragging shift and then drag that trade onto the chart

19

00:01:26.160  -->  00:01:26.580
.

20

00:01:26.580  -->  00:01:30.630
So we've got the trades here and I just wanted to share that for a live real account.

21

00:01:30.630  -->  00:01:32.640
This is something that you might want to do.

22

00:01:32.730  -->  00:01:40.230
You might want to analyze your trades in this kind of way because it kind of it also shows you more

23

00:01:40.290  -->  00:01:48.000
than you can see just from looking at the line items in your account history.

24

00:01:48.000  -->  00:01:51.180
So here you've got some sell orders.

25

00:01:51.180  -->  00:01:52.370
One was profitable.

26

00:01:52.370  -->  00:01:53.920
Two were losses.

27

00:01:54.000  -->  00:01:58.830
On the next day we had to sell orders that were profitable one buy order which was a loss.

28

00:01:58.980  -->  00:02:05.130
But from here you can see that it could have been profitable if maybe this buy order had a larger stop

29

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:05.490
loss.

30

00:02:05.490  -->  00:02:11.150
So as you can see the price just Tasha's Stop-Loss and went up it could have been a profitable buy or

31

00:02:11.150  -->  00:02:12.200
to potentially.

32

00:02:12.240  -->  00:02:18.840
So maybe you might want to consider for this particular set which had Laud's 0.0 to maybe increasing

33

00:02:18.840  -->  00:02:19.560
the stop loss.

34

00:02:19.590  -->  00:02:24.720
Maybe not but that's something that you can see from this kind of analysis and so on you can go through

35

00:02:24.720  -->  00:02:28.500
the days and see exactly what kind of trades were conducted.

36

00:02:28.510  -->  00:02:38.360
It's always interesting to see what was going on on your column during this two week real test.

37

00:02:38.390  -->  00:02:45.730
So now let's have a look at the trades in our current history and see what we can see there.

38

00:02:45.990  -->  00:02:51.570
Right now they're sorted by size I'm just going to sort them by order number as they are normally and

39

00:02:51.660  -->  00:02:55.340
right away we'll go to the bottom and see what the result was.

40

00:02:55.650  -->  00:03:02.910
As you can see here happy news $533 and seventy four cents on the count at the end of two weeks.

41

00:03:03.240  -->  00:03:06.630
And that is that is a great result.

42

00:03:06.630  -->  00:03:15.120
We started with $500 and that means these three systems in combination create a profit of thirty three

43

00:03:15.120  -->  00:03:17.760
dollars and seventy four cents just in two weeks.

44

00:03:17.760  -->  00:03:20.810
That doesn't sound like a lot but let me put that into perspective.

45

00:03:20.880  -->  00:03:28.500
That is six point seventy five percent profit in just two weeks in annual terms that means 175 percent

46

00:03:28.650  -->  00:03:31.770
profit which is an incredible result.

47

00:03:31.770  -->  00:03:34.740
I know that we're not looking for profit.

48

00:03:34.890  -->  00:03:40.530
Not looking to make money in this particular instance we're trying to evaluate the performance of our

49

00:03:40.530  -->  00:03:43.780
systems on real market conditions.

50

00:03:43.860  -->  00:03:49.290
But nevertheless that's $33 and certainly for a sense that I'm going to be putting into my pocket at

51

00:03:49.290  -->  00:03:51.380
the end of this test and it's an amazing feeling.

52

00:03:51.380  -->  00:03:57.750
It's a great feeling to earn profits from the fork's market before even doing anything like for those

53

00:03:57.750  -->  00:03:58.530
two weeks.

54

00:03:58.590  -->  00:04:03.800
I wasn't even looking at this term and only maybe once a week to create this report.

55

00:04:03.960  -->  00:04:05.100
That's a great result.

56

00:04:05.140  -->  00:04:11.940
And more importantly it's because we created this system of our own hands and we can you know we can

57

00:04:11.940  -->  00:04:12.690
make money from it.

58

00:04:12.690  -->  00:04:18.410
So I always great get this disaster feeling when I see things like this.

59

00:04:18.960  -->  00:04:25.410
So now let's have a look at the trades and see what we can tell about these three separate sets that

60

00:04:25.410  -->  00:04:26.550
we launched.

61

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:29.850
So I'm just going to go to the top and I'm going to increase.

62

00:04:29.870  -->  00:04:35.740
I'm going to increase the size of this terminal window at the bottom so we can see a bit more.

63

00:04:35.970  -->  00:04:40.900
And so what we want to focus on is the sets separately.

64

00:04:41.010  -->  00:04:43.200
We want to look at them individually.

65

00:04:43.260  -->  00:04:44.340
Right now there is a mix.

66

00:04:44.370  -->  00:04:52.470
But as you remember I have this method of setting different size lot sizes for different sets or different

67

00:04:52.470  -->  00:04:55.210
expert Wise's when I run the test simultaneously.

68

00:04:56.070  -->  00:05:01.150
And this is because it doesn't really affect the amount of money you're going to gain or lose because

69

00:05:01.150  -->  00:05:05.740
we're not .. and we're not looking for that we're not trying to make a lot of money on this small account

70

00:05:05.740  -->  00:05:11.890
we're trying to evaluate the system but setting different sizes allows you to very quickly sort your

71

00:05:11.890  -->  00:05:15.650
results so just by clicking on this header over here.

72

00:05:15.670  -->  00:05:21.700
The size there are you can see that I've sorted my trades by size and at the top right away I have all

73

00:05:21.700  -->  00:05:29.410
these zero points or one lot trades which are associated with the simple system our equals five set

74

00:05:29.410  -->  00:05:29.920
.

75

00:05:30.220  -->  00:05:37.630
And also I'll remind you that in our demo test the hours were one less always because there is a time

76

00:05:37.630  -->  00:05:43.490
difference in the time zones that this broker is located in and the broker was located.

77

00:05:43.600  -->  00:05:49.680
So in our Dema said this was our equals four said the one that was on the bottom left corner.

78

00:05:49.990  -->  00:05:56.440
No because we don't have that many trades we can just simply do it visually we can analyze these trades

79

00:05:56.560  -->  00:05:57.520
right here.

80

00:05:57.520  -->  00:06:04.210
So we all we have to do is kind of like in our head and up and see if this particular set was profitable

81

00:06:04.340  -->  00:06:04.540
.

82

00:06:04.810  -->  00:06:08.620
And right away you can see like this trade is covered by this trade.

83

00:06:08.620  -->  00:06:10.900
So all together they are approximately zero.

84

00:06:10.900  -->  00:06:12.380
This is a profitable trade.

85

00:06:12.670  -->  00:06:20.140
And then we got form a for profit all trades in total and two losses so maybe these two together cover

86

00:06:20.200  -->  00:06:21.880
a profit or two profitable trade.

87

00:06:21.880  -->  00:06:29.640
So in total this system had created maybe a profit of over $10 which is good.

88

00:06:29.650  -->  00:06:35.980
So that tells us that this this particular set was profitable on this account and for that for us at

89

00:06:35.980  -->  00:06:44.620
this stage this is sufficient to say yes this is potentially something that we would want to explore

90

00:06:44.620  -->  00:06:48.940
further and take to a large scale real account.

91

00:06:48.960  -->  00:06:55.120
So we've already seen the demo test back to us the forward tests and now we can see that on a small

92

00:06:55.120  -->  00:06:57.050
real account it is performing well.

93

00:06:57.070  -->  00:07:06.550
So most likely the performance that we've seen on the demo count will can be extrapolated onto a real

94

00:07:07.160  -->  00:07:08.760
real account conditions.

95

00:07:09.310  -->  00:07:16.180
So now let's move onto the 0.02 lots that were always 9 in the Demel test that was our this is our turn

96

00:07:16.180  -->  00:07:18.610
in the demo test our was 9 that's the top right one.

97

00:07:18.610  -->  00:07:24.610
And as you remember that's the one that had short stop losses but very high tech profits.

98

00:07:24.820  -->  00:07:26.740
And the same we can see here.

99

00:07:26.740  -->  00:07:33.460
So there's this large profit and then this small profit because that's what that was when the trade

100

00:07:33.460  -->  00:07:34.290
timed out.

101

00:07:34.630  -->  00:07:40.960
And then we've got quite a few losses so in total it looks like there are more losses on the second

102

00:07:40.960  -->  00:07:44.670
so we've got 1 2 3 4 5.

103

00:07:44.770  -->  00:07:52.720
So there are some in here 1 2 3 4 5 5 loss of about $6 each That's minus 30 dollars and we only have

104

00:07:52.950  -->  00:07:54.240
$23 profit.

105

00:07:54.460  -->  00:08:00.850
So once again the trend continues the behavior continues and this is something we saw on the demo tests

106

00:08:00.850  -->  00:08:02.960
that we're not very comfortable.

107

00:08:02.960  -->  00:08:07.950
Personally I'm not very comfortable waiting for this large profitable trade to cover the losses.

108

00:08:08.020  -->  00:08:13.360
And in this particular instance it so happened that in two weeks the said wasn't able to cover its losses

109

00:08:13.360  -->  00:08:16.130
with profitable trades because it only had one.

110

00:08:16.300  -->  00:08:23.560
So this is something that personally I wouldn't consider taking further into real large scale real account

111

00:08:23.590  -->  00:08:30.180
because it's it's quite still quite an unstable set.

112

00:08:30.220  -->  00:08:37.990
And I'm not very I'm not comfortable at all putting this letting this set trade with my real money or

113

00:08:38.650  -->  00:08:40.620
even more so in investors real money.

114

00:08:40.630  -->  00:08:48.570
So at this stage I would just stop evaluating this set and not take it further to a large scale real

115

00:08:48.570  -->  00:08:49.130
account.

116

00:08:49.360  -->  00:08:54.070
And finally let's look at the point 0 3 loss that's where simple the hour was nine.

117

00:08:54.070  -->  00:09:02.080
A simple system set who are nine and as you remember in our test that was our 8 that was the one at

118

00:09:02.080  -->  00:09:09.640
the bottom right which had an outstanding performance win or most of the trades were just profitable

119

00:09:09.880  -->  00:09:10.590
trades.

120

00:09:10.690  -->  00:09:18.250
And here we can see the same thing a lot of profitable trades one loss and a lot of profitable trades

121

00:09:18.250  -->  00:09:18.280
.

122

00:09:18.290  -->  00:09:26.230
And even in the last week we didn't see that loss on the Friday when non-farm payroll and unemployment

123

00:09:26.230  -->  00:09:27.220
came out.

124

00:09:27.220  -->  00:09:30.310
And that's that's I think that's just lucky.

125

00:09:30.310  -->  00:09:35.320
That's because there may be a discrepancy of quotations between this broker and the demo broker and

126

00:09:35.320  -->  00:09:38.670
we did see that last in the demo but not here.

127

00:09:39.210  -->  00:09:39.980
So.

128

00:09:40.100  -->  00:09:43.500
Well that's just luck of the draw in this case.

129

00:09:43.510  -->  00:09:45.550
And that's good for us.

130

00:09:45.550  -->  00:09:51.610
We did see this some last trade which we which happened on the 25th of September regencies and demo

131

00:09:51.610  -->  00:09:58.300
accounts and that's once again a discrepancy between like the live quotations and the demo quotations

132

00:09:58.300  -->  00:10:00.490
on the broker different brokers.

133

00:10:00.490  -->  00:10:07.600
So you will find these variations in results but in general you can see that this said is very profitable

134

00:10:07.600  -->  00:10:07.660
.

135

00:10:07.690  -->  00:10:12.240
It is just smashing and just all these profitable trades.

136

00:10:12.250  -->  00:10:18.640
And I think it coward covered up even for this other set that was creating a loss in their columns and

137

00:10:18.640  -->  00:10:23.770
that's mostly because of this set with 1 0 3 loss.

138

00:10:23.770  -->  00:10:26.070
That's where most of our profit came from.

139

00:10:26.100  -->  00:10:33.900
And so this is something that we would definitely consider taking to a real account of large scale real

140

00:10:33.900  -->  00:10:34.530
count.

141

00:10:34.810  -->  00:10:41.910
And finally at the end of this trial we're going to just look at a detailed report.

142

00:10:42.100  -->  00:10:48.380
So Cook save a detailed report select a name for a report on that on that was an old one.

143

00:10:48.610  -->  00:10:49.320
I shall leave it.

144

00:10:49.330  -->  00:10:51.320
But I'll just change the date.

145

00:10:51.340  -->  00:10:57.370
So what is it today ten of six of the 10th.

146

00:10:57.490  -->  00:11:03.350
So that and this brings up in detail the report in HMO form which is very convenient for analysis.

147

00:11:03.880  -->  00:11:07.440
As you can see it's got an extra line here because of our comment.

148

00:11:07.450  -->  00:11:14.230
So if you're not happy with that just uncheck comment in the results and you won't see this this line

149

00:11:14.240  -->  00:11:21.160
over here but now scrolling down all we want to look at right now is the chart.

150

00:11:21.160  -->  00:11:25.120
So that's our total chart for this system.

151

00:11:25.120  -->  00:11:30.580
As you can see at the start it wasn't doing very well the first 12 tries but then it just skyrocketed

152

00:11:31.120  -->  00:11:34.030
and the profit factor is one point sixty six.

153

00:11:34.030  -->  00:11:41.950
Yes which is just above the one point recommended 1.6 meaning that this even in in combination even

154

00:11:41.950  -->  00:11:45.700
when you have all three working it is considered a stable system.

155

00:11:45.700  -->  00:11:55.220
Now imagine what will happen if you take out that unprofitable set zero point zero or two on the take

156

00:11:55.240  -->  00:12:02.140
profit will skyrocket as well and expected payoff is one point forty seven dollars net profit per trade

157

00:12:02.140  -->  00:12:10.210
which is quite good for a small account like this and a maximal drawdown is only two point fifty nine

158

00:12:10.210  -->  00:12:12.610
percent which is which is great as well.

159

00:12:12.640  -->  00:12:15.230
So that's how you analyze a live real test.

160

00:12:15.310  -->  00:12:20.920
And in the next tutorial We'll wrap up this section by talking a little bit more generally about these

161

00:12:20.920  -->  00:12:25.060
kind of demo tests and live real tests on small counts.

162

00:12:25.150  -->  00:12:29.820
So I look for you then and until next time have training.
