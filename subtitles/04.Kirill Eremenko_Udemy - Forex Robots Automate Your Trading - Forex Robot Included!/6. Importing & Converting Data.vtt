00:00:07.030  -->  00:00:09.440
Hello this is Kiril from dot com.

2

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:15.420
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditative for in today's tutorial we

3

00:00:15.420  -->  00:00:21.650
will finish the topic of importing daughter into the trading platform and we will be talking about importing

4

00:00:21.650  -->  00:00:30.630
third party data importing third party data implies that you get your data from a certain provider such

5

00:00:30.630  -->  00:00:35.710
as a broker and you download it from their website and then you upload it to Metro.

6

00:00:35.710  -->  00:00:41.530
For now unfortunately not all brokers provide their daughter and I'm not sure why that is the case.

7

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:48.370
Because if I were a broker I would definitely put out my metatrader 4 historical data onto the website

8

00:00:48.520  -->  00:00:52.090
so people could download it and use it in their back tests.

9

00:00:52.110  -->  00:00:55.500
But not all brokers do that.

10

00:00:55.500  -->  00:00:56.610
However there are a few.

11

00:00:56.610  -->  00:01:01.540
For example if it's a D and O and I think does it and maybe a couple more.

12

00:01:01.740  -->  00:01:09.000
So if you go to Google and you look for something like FXE GMT for daughter then you'll be able to find

13

00:01:09.000  -->  00:01:11.250
their page here which is this one.

14

00:01:11.250  -->  00:01:15.050
And here they have a trailer for one minute door.

15

00:01:15.060  -->  00:01:19.910
They do have an instruction on how to upload it but will will go through it today.

16

00:01:20.130  -->  00:01:26.970
Here is a selection of Southern currency pairs which you can download as you can see a download at the

17

00:01:27.390  -->  00:01:28.570
British pound.

18

00:01:28.570  -->  00:01:30.630
Frank Australian dollar yen.

19

00:01:30.660  -->  00:01:34.250
Let's get another one let's get you on Dalia's.

20

00:01:34.290  -->  00:01:41.040
I just want to show you the size the size of these files isn't that great it's about 30 to 40 megabytes

21

00:01:41.660  -->  00:01:43.250
and there is arccos.

22

00:01:43.410  -->  00:01:45.730
So once you unzip them they look something like this.

23

00:01:45.750  -->  00:01:49.540
And this is an example of American dollar Canadian dollar.

24

00:01:49.770  -->  00:01:59.700
So if we go to our Metro platform now and we go to Chaar tools History Center and you open the American

25

00:01:59.700  -->  00:02:04.910
dollar Canadian dollar currency pair if you go to one you'll see that it's empty right now.

26

00:02:04.920  -->  00:02:08.070
And some thought it will be a request from the broker there it is.

27

00:02:08.340  -->  00:02:11.390
But how do we import our downloaded data.

28

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:17.250
So now it's sort of clicking download we're going to do is we're going to go import in here you need

29

00:02:17.250  -->  00:02:18.970
to find your file.

30

00:02:18.990  -->  00:02:23.720
In my case it's created on this path.

31

00:02:23.960  -->  00:02:30.540
So you select a file and originally more than likely this window will be blank so there won't be a preview

32

00:02:30.540  -->  00:02:36.460
so just click OK and then do that procedure again click Import and then you'll see what I see now or

33

00:02:36.510  -->  00:02:38.240
a preview of your file.

34

00:02:38.250  -->  00:02:46.200
So if you click OK all of these records will be loaded into Ameritrade for and as you can see we have

35

00:02:46.590  -->  00:02:49.970
1 minute timeframe bars all the way from 2005.

36

00:02:50.220  -->  00:02:51.060
So that's great.

37

00:02:51.180  -->  00:02:52.460
And that part is done.

38

00:02:52.470  -->  00:03:00.480
But now we have a question how do we get all this data into the other timeframes how do we update the

39

00:03:00.480  -->  00:03:01.740
15 minute timeframe.

40

00:03:01.740  -->  00:03:02.550
If you go here.

41

00:03:02.580  -->  00:03:05.750
It's empty that one hour time frame they're all empty right now.

42

00:03:05.910  -->  00:03:15.720
And how do we use the 1 minute data to update this data because maybe we need that for testing.

43

00:03:16.080  -->  00:03:21.300
As you can see here this is some data was requested from the server but it has nothing to do with our

44

00:03:21.300  -->  00:03:23.430
one minute data over here.

45

00:03:23.430  -->  00:03:24.770
So how do we do that.

46

00:03:24.780  -->  00:03:30.100
Well there is a standard procedure and I'll show you how it's done right now.

47

00:03:30.330  -->  00:03:37.290
So we're going to close that and you need to now go into a navigator and go into the scripts folder

48

00:03:37.310  -->  00:03:37.500
.

49

00:03:37.740  -->  00:03:40.460
And here you need to find the period converter.

50

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:47.810
This is a script that is pre-packaged with every minute trader for on the planet quotes puts it in Ameritrade

51

00:03:47.810  -->  00:03:54.150
or for specifically for this purpose to be able to recalculate time frames and it is extremely simple

52

00:03:54.150  -->  00:03:56.880
to use and I'll demonstrate that right now.

53

00:03:56.910  -->  00:04:06.840
So if we open a chart the used dollar Canadian chart and we go to the one mean time frame here.

54

00:04:06.870  -->  00:04:09.710
I'm just going to check the auto scroll and I'm going to zoom out.

55

00:04:09.780  -->  00:04:15.660
You'll notice that if I click the home button we go all the way back to 2005 which is good which means

56

00:04:15.690  -->  00:04:19.080
our data is being displayed in the terminal.

57

00:04:19.080  -->  00:04:24.590
Now if we go to the five minute time frame on the other hand and we go click home the first we can go

58

00:04:24.590  -->  00:04:27.830
is around September 14 or maybe more data will be loaded.

59

00:04:27.840  -->  00:04:30.700
But this is not the data that we imported.

60

00:04:30.720  -->  00:04:36.790
So let's go back to the M1 period and here what we wanted to do is we want to launch the script.

61

00:04:37.170  -->  00:04:44.490
So not take and drag that period convert onto the chart before we go to the inputs make sure in the

62

00:04:44.520  -->  00:04:47.880
common section you've got a lot of JLL imports.

63

00:04:47.880  -->  00:04:56.490
And generally that up here you've got older trading allowed and also deal imports is important because

64

00:04:56.510  -->  00:05:03.570
descript has a dependency has these three to deal elso just make sure that that box is checked.

65

00:05:03.810  -->  00:05:10.200
And if you go to inputs here you need to select a multiplier.

66

00:05:10.230  -->  00:05:15.630
So we're working with the one minute time frame and we want to calculate the 5 minute timeframe so we

67

00:05:15.630  -->  00:05:17.310
need to put 5 in here.

68

00:05:17.550  -->  00:05:19.880
So we're going to click OK.

69

00:05:20.550  -->  00:05:25.410
If you look at your terminal window that's the one where you can see a balance sheet account history

70

00:05:25.570  -->  00:05:31.290
if you go into the experts tab you'll see that it's got some messages here that the script was loaded

71

00:05:31.350  -->  00:05:33.820
and that it's residents are a number of records.

72

00:05:33.870  -->  00:05:35.770
So what we wanted to do now is we want to.

73

00:05:35.790  -->  00:05:41.970
Once it's finished we want to right click and remove script and when that's done we need to close the

74

00:05:41.970  -->  00:05:44.400
terminal and we need to open it again.

75

00:05:44.400  -->  00:05:49.780
So basically restart the terminal so that it picks up this new file that has been created.

76

00:05:50.250  -->  00:05:59.100
And now if we go to the five minute timeframe of this currency pair and we click home you'll see that

77

00:05:59.100  -->  00:06:05.880
we're going all the way back to 2005 and we can also check that through the history center.

78

00:06:06.120  -->  00:06:11.530
If we go double click on five and scroll down you see that were in 2005.

79

00:06:11.740  -->  00:06:17.630
Seven hundred and sixteen thousand records just about or just over that.

80

00:06:17.850  -->  00:06:21.540
So that's that's exactly how you convert daughter.

81

00:06:21.540  -->  00:06:27.030
You can do that for any time Thurm just get a multiplier right to show and do 15 minutes or be a 15

82

00:06:27.030  -->  00:06:27.360
.

83

00:06:27.430  -->  00:06:30.720
Q want to do one hour I'll be a 60 and so on.

84

00:06:30.720  -->  00:06:33.970
Those are pretty simple to calculate and just.

85

00:06:34.020  -->  00:06:40.530
But the thing is you have to do it for all the time frames that you need in your back test that's done

86

00:06:40.530  -->  00:06:40.840
.

87

00:06:40.860  -->  00:06:45.100
And before we finish this tutorial I just wanted to show you an interesting thing.

88

00:06:45.120  -->  00:06:54.300
If you go to file and you go open a folder here it is what you'll see is this is the dot a folder for

89

00:06:54.300  -->  00:06:55.150
this terminal.

90

00:06:55.170  -->  00:07:02.760
And if you go to history and then you select your server then you'll find all the files all the history

91

00:07:02.760  -->  00:07:09.030
files of this terminal so if you ever need to delete some history in order to upload it or you just

92

00:07:09.030  -->  00:07:14.580
want to be sure that the history you're upload importing or downloading from Medich quotes is there

93

00:07:14.640  -->  00:07:19.950
is the right one you can always delete something and I'll show you an example.

94

00:07:19.950  -->  00:07:26.730
So we know that we've just seen we have the five minute time frame data so close the terminal and I'm

95

00:07:26.730  -->  00:07:31.000
going to go and I'm just going to read all of the U.S dollar CAD data.

96

00:07:31.320  -->  00:07:33.210
So get rid of them.

97

00:07:33.250  -->  00:07:34.560
No they're not here anymore.

98

00:07:34.560  -->  00:07:40.080
So now if we launch the terminal you'll see that they used all Canadian chart is updating meaning that

99

00:07:40.080  -->  00:07:46.370
it doesn't have data and we can also confirm that by going to the History Center DoubleClick and there's

100

00:07:46.380  -->  00:07:49.740
nothing here this has just been loaded from a broker and so on.

101

00:07:49.740  -->  00:07:53.610
So that's a very convenient way of cleaning your history.

102

00:07:53.610  -->  00:07:56.200
You don't have to delete records from here one by one.

103

00:07:56.280  -->  00:07:59.460
Just go into that folder and just get rid of them there.

104

00:07:59.790  -->  00:08:00.880
So that's all for today.

105

00:08:00.900  -->  00:08:05.100
I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and you found this information useful.

106

00:08:05.100  -->  00:08:06.570
I look forward to seeing you next time.

107

00:08:06.570  -->  00:08:08.070
And until then Happy training
