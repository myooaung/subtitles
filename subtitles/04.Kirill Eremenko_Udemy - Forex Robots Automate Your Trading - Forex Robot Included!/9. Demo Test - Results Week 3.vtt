Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.850  -->  00:00:14.170
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditative for.

3

00:00:14.250  -->  00:00:19.260
It has been three weeks since we launched our test and today we'll be checking in to see how are things

4

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:19.830
going.

5

00:00:20.070  -->  00:00:24.770
So we saw them in tests on the 8th of September 2014.

6

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:32.340
As you can see it's been three four weeks and today Sunday 28 of September in 2014.

7

00:00:32.400  -->  00:00:34.790
So let's have a look at how tests are going.

8

00:00:35.150  -->  00:00:40.700
Set number one where our was 10 as you can see it's lost quite a lot of money.

9

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:43.680
And it did have one profitable trade over here.

10

00:00:43.860  -->  00:00:45.440
But most of them are losses.

11

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:48.680
So we'll just completely disregard this.

12

00:00:48.720  -->  00:00:52.040
Here said Number two we're always nine.

13

00:00:52.170  -->  00:00:59.400
As you remember last week it had a profitable trade and actually it had two profitable trades that covered

14

00:00:59.670  -->  00:01:01.080
its losses.

15

00:01:01.170  -->  00:01:09.630
But then since then this week it has had four losses two three losses and one small profitable trade

16

00:01:09.630  -->  00:01:09.650
.

17

00:01:09.650  -->  00:01:14.970
So that wasn't sufficient to cover the losses for this week.

18

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:20.570
Overall it's just a bar from its initial balance of $5000.

19

00:01:20.580  -->  00:01:24.180
But as you can see the set is very unstable.

20

00:01:24.420  -->  00:01:30.660
And like I probably wouldn't recommend putting something like this on a real account.

21

00:01:30.660  -->  00:01:34.500
We will still have a look at how you know it goes.

22

00:01:34.510  -->  00:01:40.930
Maybe it will improve in the next week but for now it's not a very good set.

23

00:01:41.100  -->  00:01:48.450
Next is a setting in Missouri where our risk for our is quite good said right now it's doing the best

24

00:01:48.700  -->  00:01:51.170
it's at seven thousand three hundred sixty one dollars.

25

00:01:51.330  -->  00:01:55.830
There's only been a couple of losses and most profitable trades are here.

26

00:01:55.830  -->  00:01:58.140
So I really like this one.

27

00:01:58.140  -->  00:02:03.600
And let's just drag this whole down shift and drag the trades onto the chart.

28

00:02:03.660  -->  00:02:06.810
Maybe they'll show some things you can see.

29

00:02:06.810  -->  00:02:10.580
There was one there's a loss over their sell order that went wrong.

30

00:02:10.770  -->  00:02:13.150
But otherwise it's doing really well.

31

00:02:13.250  -->  00:02:20.280
And yeah this one is proving to be an interesting set that we might consider putting in a real account

32

00:02:20.300  -->  00:02:20.540
.

33

00:02:20.850  -->  00:02:26.990
And finally a simple system set for our WAS 8 8 is just unbelievable.

34

00:02:27.030  -->  00:02:30.330
Not even one loss over the past three weeks.

35

00:02:30.330  -->  00:02:33.150
All trades are profitable.

36

00:02:33.300  -->  00:02:38.210
So even if a loss does occur next week we've already prepared for it.

37

00:02:38.310  -->  00:02:43.910
And like the expert Yser is doing very well so it can afford to have a loss.

38

00:02:44.190  -->  00:02:51.510
But we'll see how we go and hopefully this trend continues that we're really rocking the market here

39

00:02:51.510  -->  00:02:51.760
.

40

00:02:51.840  -->  00:02:57.420
And this just means that sometimes when you optimize your expert advice you might find a set like this

41

00:02:57.420  -->  00:03:02.110
which is performing really well for this particular period of time that you're in.

42

00:03:02.490  -->  00:03:07.950
And that's an example of when you don't want to run your demo test for too long if you're observing

43

00:03:08.520  -->  00:03:10.760
something like this for three weeks.

44

00:03:10.770  -->  00:03:17.190
We've been seeing this then maybe you might want to start putting on a real account so that you ride

45

00:03:17.190  -->  00:03:23.210
the wave while it's there because ultimately you will have to really optimize any expense wise and with

46

00:03:23.250  -->  00:03:23.760
time.

47

00:03:23.880  -->  00:03:27.080
So you never know how long trends like this continue.

48

00:03:27.180  -->  00:03:29.270
So that's it for today.

49

00:03:29.290  -->  00:03:36.720
Will give this demo test one more week and see what the results will be at the end of next week which

50

00:03:36.720  -->  00:03:39.960
will mark one month of our demo test.

51

00:03:40.170  -->  00:03:42.340
And I look forward to seeing in that tutorial.

52

00:03:42.390  -->  00:03:43.710
Until then happy trading
