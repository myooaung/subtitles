00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:09,540
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,540  -->  00:00:15,360
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization Ameritrade for as you can see from here in

3

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:21,970
the previous tutorial we talked about the two dimensional surface analysis technique in MT 4.

4

00:00:22,080  -->  00:00:29,980
And today we will talk about exploring optimization results into Excel and further analysis there.

5

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:31,640
So let's jump straight into it.

6

00:00:31,710  -->  00:00:38,640
If we go to the optimization results tab you'll see the set of optimization results which I have from

7

00:00:38,640  -->  00:00:39,560
last time.

8

00:00:39,990  -->  00:00:45,720
And originally there will always be ordered by Profitt cells just illustrate that that's how your results

9

00:00:45,720  -->  00:00:48,300
come up after the transition is complete.

10

00:00:48,330  -->  00:00:49,970
First what we want to do.

11

00:00:50,020  -->  00:00:57,870
Or want to order them by pass so the first passes at the top then just bear in mind that if you did

12

00:00:57,870  -->  00:01:02,690
have Skipp useless results checked when you ran the optimization you won't see the negative results

13

00:01:02,690  -->  00:01:03,900
here.

14

00:01:04,760  -->  00:01:11,580
In this stage right now we want to export all of our results to Excel so that we can analyze all of

15

00:01:11,580  -->  00:01:12,560
them there.

16

00:01:12,570  -->  00:01:18,690
So if you want to follow along like that just make sure this is unchecked and just rerun the optimization

17

00:01:18,690  -->  00:01:20,770
if you do check it.

18

00:01:20,940  -->  00:01:26,220
Next what we're going to do is we're going to call a click copyable or just press Alt A on the keyboard

19

00:01:26,240  -->  00:01:26,400
.

20

00:01:26,580  -->  00:01:29,020
So do that.

21

00:01:29,130  -->  00:01:33,260
After that you need to open a blank Excel workbook like I have here.

22

00:01:33,390  -->  00:01:38,720
Then right click and click paste that'll paste your results into Excel.

23

00:01:39,240  -->  00:01:45,090
The only main drawback that you can see here right away is that we don't have headers in this Excel

24

00:01:45,090  -->  00:01:50,520
spreadsheet so we're going to fix that and we're going to right click on the first column and click

25

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:56,100
insert which will give us a US first row and click insert which will give us a blank row.

26

00:01:56,100  -->  00:01:58,950
And now we're just going to make this smaller.

27

00:01:59,030  -->  00:02:00,620
Will type in the headers manually.

28

00:02:00,780  -->  00:02:05,390
Unfortunately you do have to type and type them in manually but you cannot.

29

00:02:05,460  -->  00:02:11,120
You probably only need to there once because you can always just copy them across to your other workbooks

30

00:02:11,140  -->  00:02:11,160
.

31

00:02:11,160  -->  00:02:12,990
We analyzed the results.

32

00:02:12,990  -->  00:02:17,080
So I'm just going to do that.

33

00:02:17,490  -->  00:02:25,240
So I have populated all of the headers and now we see the next abnormal thing it's these this column

34

00:02:25,260  -->  00:02:26,550
full of zeroes.

35

00:02:27,000  -->  00:02:32,660
This started occurring from one of the recent builds aventure for all.

36

00:02:32,700  -->  00:02:38,400
And you can either just give it a name such as empty or did it all together and that's exactly what

37

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:39,210
I'm going to do.

38

00:02:39,450  -->  00:02:42,170
So I'm going to click here and click delete.

39

00:02:42,240  -->  00:02:48,630
Now one other thing I like to do is if you select all of your cells and then just by clicking up here

40

00:02:48,870  -->  00:02:56,040
in this corner over here and then you double click on any one of the column dividers the cells the columns

41

00:02:56,040  -->  00:02:58,890
will automatically will order size.

42

00:02:59,160  -->  00:03:05,460
And then maybe if we make this one a little bit bigger that allows you to see all the contents of the

43

00:03:05,460  -->  00:03:07,200
cells.

44

00:03:07,200  -->  00:03:16,890
And finally the last challenge we have before we can move on with analysis is these values of the parameters

45

00:03:16,980  -->  00:03:19,010
are present in the workbook.

46

00:03:19,020  -->  00:03:25,350
However there the both the name and the value of the parameter are in each cell and we don't want that

47

00:03:25,360  -->  00:03:29,910
we want the names of the parameters to be up here and the values to be here suits best suit would be

48

00:03:29,910  -->  00:03:38,160
very similar to what we have for ratio's because they have the names up there and the values in the

49

00:03:38,160  -->  00:03:39,040
cells themselves.

50

00:03:39,060  -->  00:03:41,230
And it's easier to analyze that way.

51

00:03:41,640  -->  00:03:52,200
So in order to do that we're going to do the next procedure so we just copy the name of your parameter

52

00:03:52,950  -->  00:03:58,510
and place it into the top of the cell so we're going to populate up here.

53

00:03:58,570  -->  00:04:05,730
We're not going to just type in the name of the parents and we will type in their parameter equals name

54

00:04:05,730  -->  00:04:09,740
of parameter and why we need to do that.

55

00:04:09,750  -->  00:04:12,610
I will explain in a minute.

56

00:04:12,690  -->  00:04:15,900
Same thing for this take profit.

57

00:04:16,650  -->  00:04:18,980
So we're going to type that in.

58

00:04:19,080  -->  00:04:27,120
So we've populated the top row with these equal parameter name Eco's Param name and some just going

59

00:04:27,120  -->  00:04:34,560
to show you a very efficient way of getting these values out of the cells or just keeping the values

60

00:04:34,560  -->  00:04:37,150
in the cells and getting rid of the name of the parameter.

61

00:04:37,200  -->  00:04:44,070
So just highlight the role that you want to do that for go to dadda and here select text to columns

62

00:04:44,610  -->  00:04:52,260
and indexical them select delimited then unselect tab and select other and then other just put an equal

63

00:04:52,260  -->  00:04:55,370
sign and click next.

64

00:04:55,500  -->  00:05:02,830
And then when you've got this first column select is selected do not import Culham skip that will skip

65

00:05:02,820  -->  00:05:07,620
this column and then with this general column just keep it as general.

66

00:05:07,620  -->  00:05:08,840
It's all good.

67

00:05:08,860  -->  00:05:14,430
And as you can see what that will do is it will split your column at the equal sign and that's why we

68

00:05:14,430  -->  00:05:20,710
were putting the equal sign in for the Herro as well so that it would be able to split as well and we

69

00:05:20,700  -->  00:05:22,590
get rid of this Barbul keep this part.

70

00:05:22,600  -->  00:05:24,560
So now we're going to click Finish.

71

00:05:24,780  -->  00:05:29,340
And as you can see here we have many people who are at the top and the values down the bottom.

72

00:05:29,380  -->  00:05:33,420
So now we're going to do that for the rest of the columns.

73

00:05:33,430  -->  00:05:39,310
All right so I've done that same procedure first the columns it took less than a minute.

74

00:05:39,620  -->  00:05:48,960
And now we have all of our optimization results separated and we can very easily analyze them in Excel

75

00:05:48,970  -->  00:05:49,470
.

76

00:05:49,480  -->  00:05:56,020
So what are some examples of analysis would be we could first of all we could add it filter up here

77

00:05:56,020  -->  00:05:56,200
.

78

00:05:56,400  -->  00:06:00,760
So in the same daughter ribbon just click filter and that as a filter.

79

00:06:00,750  -->  00:06:07,840
And here we can now easily not like what we were able to do back in the intro for we could we could

80

00:06:07,870  -->  00:06:15,120
sort by told trades largest to smallest So that's a maximal smallest the largest or sort of a profit

81

00:06:15,120  -->  00:06:22,180
factor but that was the limitation to what we were able to do is actually going to make this a bit more

82

00:06:22,180  -->  00:06:27,470
appealing visually.

83

00:06:28,690  -->  00:06:34,770
Put that in the center so that there was a limitation on what we were able to do but now we can do much

84

00:06:34,770  -->  00:06:35,770
much more.

85

00:06:36,100  -->  00:06:43,210
And especially if you're you've got basic Excel skills you'll find that you can do quite a lot of cool

86

00:06:43,200  -->  00:06:43,940
stuff.

87

00:06:44,190  -->  00:06:54,060
For example if I want to now sort by the parameters Let's say I want to sort by stop loss.

88

00:06:54,250  -->  00:06:55,530
Now I can do that right.

89

00:06:55,530  -->  00:07:02,430
I can sort from the lowest to the largest of the largest the lowest or if say I want to only look at

90

00:07:02,440  -->  00:07:03,670
certain limits.

91

00:07:03,690  -->  00:07:11,050
I want to look at four and five in my analysis and then I also want to look at take profits that were

92

00:07:11,310  -->  00:07:14,840
the lower take profits I want to see 10 15 20 25.

93

00:07:15,040  -->  00:07:16,680
I don't want to see anything above that.

94

00:07:16,960  -->  00:07:22,540
And I've got them there and now I want to order about profit large the largest to smallest and I can

95

00:07:22,530  -->  00:07:29,110
see the large profit here then say for example we don't want to do anything with these because these

96

00:07:29,110  -->  00:07:35,380
were not optimized so metric for always puts the pyramid as it did optimize in the first place.

97

00:07:35,380  -->  00:07:40,050
And that way you can do that for example.

98

00:07:40,120  -->  00:07:46,770
Now if I want to see all parameters with profit factor say here if we go to conditional formatting and

99

00:07:46,770  -->  00:07:56,190
we do color scale we do color scale like that we'll see a color scale showing the most profitable and

100

00:07:56,190  -->  00:08:02,170
the least profitable results or favorable results in terms of profit factors are the least are over

101

00:08:02,160  -->  00:08:05,690
here and you can see how they gradually increase like that.

102

00:08:05,710  -->  00:08:13,780
And because it's ordered by profit but that was ordered by total or let's get rid of the mid limit limitation

103

00:08:14,130  -->  00:08:23,320
and that's ordered by total trade say largest to smallest and you can say for here we also add a color

104

00:08:23,310  -->  00:08:23,790
scale.

105

00:08:23,790  -->  00:08:33,340
But in this in this case we say let's use a blue and red color scale you can see that there are some

106

00:08:33,510  -->  00:08:35,540
negative ones here.

107

00:08:35,940  -->  00:08:41,460
And then there's a chunk of good green profit factors.

108

00:08:41,470  -->  00:08:44,770
And then as this drops off you see a mix.

109

00:08:44,760  -->  00:08:51,300
So even with a low number of total trades is a high number of profit factor or high value of profit

110

00:08:51,310  -->  00:08:53,790
factor and then very very low trade.

111

00:08:53,790  -->  00:08:59,430
You see this anomaly that they are proud they are very high profit factors at 31 trades.

112

00:08:59,470  -->  00:09:07,780
So you kind of can do very interesting visual analytics here and you can create charts and just basically

113

00:09:07,770  -->  00:09:09,890
do any of that Excel analysis.

114

00:09:09,900  -->  00:09:21,180
You are familiar with or have knowledge of how to do and that can significantly speed up the process

115

00:09:21,180  -->  00:09:23,770
of analyzing optimization results.

116

00:09:23,760  -->  00:09:29,070
So that's all for today in the next term I'll show you one specific example of how to benefit from this

117

00:09:29,080  -->  00:09:35,100
and that's how to calculate the recovery factor and that's a parameter that is very important in trading

118

00:09:35,110  -->  00:09:35,130
.

119

00:09:35,130  -->  00:09:39,540
But it is actually not represented in any of the meditator four reports.

120

00:09:39,820  -->  00:09:41,360
So we'll look at that next time.

121

00:09:41,400  -->  00:09:47,520
And until I see you on that Tauriel happy training.
