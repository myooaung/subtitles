00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:03,390
Hello welcome to the course on testing and optimization.

2

00:00:03,390  -->  00:00:06,950
I'm super excited that you decided to join in this course.

3

00:00:06,960  -->  00:00:11,960
You will learn a lot and you will have heaps of fun along the way.

4

00:00:12,060  -->  00:00:16,390
And this story is designed to give you a quick overview of the structure of the course.

5

00:00:16,400  -->  00:00:18,320
You can navigate it better.

6

00:00:18,330  -->  00:00:20,070
All right so let's jump straight into it.

7

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:26,310
So here at the top we've got the promotional video that's the one you saw when you were enrolling in

8

00:00:26,310  -->  00:00:26,980
the course.

9

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:32,730
And then right away we've got the introduction section which is the section we're in right now so here

10

00:00:32,830  -->  00:00:39,300
we've got the overview tutorial which is this one we've got the disclaimer so very important to check

11

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:46,110
out the disclaimer so you understand what this course does show you and what it DOESN'T SHOW YOU SO

12

00:00:46,110  -->  00:00:52,350
DIFFERENT check out the disclaimer How To Get In fact don't proceed with the Congress unless you agree

13

00:00:52,350  -->  00:00:53,570
to the disclaimer.

14

00:00:53,790  -->  00:00:56,320
Next how to get the most out of the scores.

15

00:00:56,370  -->  00:01:02,280
A quick to tutorial on how to get the most value or discourse and choosing a broker so saw just threw

16

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:09,090
in a quick tutorial to text Tauriel on how to select your for expert.

17

00:01:09,120  -->  00:01:15,620
Basically what who my preferred mortgage broker is because I'm sure you're curious about that.

18

00:01:15,780  -->  00:01:17,720
The next section is Section 2.

19

00:01:17,850  -->  00:01:22,890
Theorie So here we've got a couple of tutorials so this is some theory that we have to go through in

20

00:01:22,890  -->  00:01:27,060
order to prepare ourselves for the rest of the course so we're on the same page.

21

00:01:27,060  -->  00:01:33,720
So here we talk about first of all I'll show you how installment a traitor for then we've got how to

22

00:01:33,780  -->  00:01:39,320
navigate the strategy should test so we took a back test forward test optimization so all of those things

23

00:01:39,320  -->  00:01:41,240
are theoretical side of everything.

24

00:01:41,310  -->  00:01:44,940
And then we got a quiz so make sure to do the quizzes in this course.

25

00:01:44,960  -->  00:01:46,140
They are very useful.

26

00:01:46,140  -->  00:01:52,050
They will help you assess your knowledge and also some of the questions are just trick questions so

27

00:01:52,380  -->  00:01:57,940
they'll definitely help you or they will allow you to have a lot of fun along the way.

28

00:01:57,930  -->  00:02:00,860
Those quizzes are quite interesting sometimes.

29

00:02:00,870  -->  00:02:01,450
All right.

30

00:02:01,470  -->  00:02:04,500
Preparation So this section is after we know the theory.

31

00:02:04,500  -->  00:02:07,350
Now we have to get everything set up.

32

00:02:07,350  -->  00:02:13,630
So here you've got the simple system training system so I actually share with you here you can download

33

00:02:13,640  -->  00:02:20,880
a share if you are a robot that I develop but bear in mind this robot is specifically developed for

34

00:02:20,970  -->  00:02:22,190
training purposes.

35

00:02:22,290  -->  00:02:29,260
In my 4 x courses so do not use this training robot on a real live account.

36

00:02:29,280  -->  00:02:35,120
This is only for you to practice the concepts that we talking about in this course.

37

00:02:35,160  -->  00:02:36,710
So make sure to keep that in mind.

38

00:02:36,720  -->  00:02:41,880
And I will mention that once again once when we get to the simple system and you will also see that

39

00:02:41,940  -->  00:02:45,710
on the disclaimer on the page we can download.

40

00:02:45,840  -->  00:02:49,480
So you get the simple system trading system here.

41

00:02:49,590  -->  00:02:56,580
Then I go through some additional modifications that I've made since very early to launch the Course

42

00:02:56,670  -->  00:02:58,180
students have.

43

00:02:58,590  -->  00:03:03,130
You know we're always interested to see how to work for trailing stop loss or you know what five digits

44

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:04,200
is four digits.

45

00:03:04,200  -->  00:03:06,250
So we've made some modifications there.

46

00:03:06,510  -->  00:03:08,340
So we've got a couple of trolls and.

47

00:03:08,670  -->  00:03:13,950
Then I show you how to download and important daughter and him editor for that we're going to the quiz

48

00:03:13,960  -->  00:03:14,000
.

49

00:03:14,040  -->  00:03:16,470
And then finally we get to the fun stuff.

50

00:03:16,470  -->  00:03:24,030
So Section 4 is where we start our optimization a demo and real testing so here we'll show you how to

51

00:03:24,030  -->  00:03:30,870
run back testing and optimization so we'll be using a simple system as an example of a robot that we

52

00:03:30,870  -->  00:03:31,800
will be optimizing.

53

00:03:31,800  -->  00:03:36,240
But basically all these concepts and this is the whole point of the course so that you learn these concepts

54

00:03:36,240  -->  00:03:41,700
and then you're able to apply them in a similar fashion to any other expert Yser out there that you

55

00:03:41,700  -->  00:03:43,020
are evaluating.

56

00:03:43,020  -->  00:03:46,960
So we talk about backtesting authorization precise optimization forward.

57

00:03:46,980  -->  00:03:51,840
So we're actually doing the practical side of things we're running all these optimizations and tests

58

00:03:52,260  -->  00:03:52,830
.

59

00:03:52,930  -->  00:03:55,830
Then I show you how to enable automated trading.

60

00:03:56,010  -->  00:03:57,700
And then we do live demo.

61

00:03:57,720  -->  00:04:00,790
So the live demo tests are going to run for four weeks.

62

00:04:00,900  -->  00:04:04,670
I'll be checking every single week to show you how the results are going.

63

00:04:04,770  -->  00:04:12,900
And you're welcome to also run your own live demo tests on your demo account and there at the end we

64

00:04:12,900  -->  00:04:18,650
will evaluate which expert advisers have succeeded through the demo tests which have not.

65

00:04:18,720  -->  00:04:24,360
Then I will move onto the real test so this is the part where we kind of split because I will be running

66

00:04:24,390  -->  00:04:26,820
real tests on my account.

67

00:04:26,850  -->  00:04:33,720
I will show you how I will be running a small real test on real accounts but with small funds so because

68

00:04:33,720  -->  00:04:39,420
these are tests after all at this stage you will be able to just observe how I'm doing real tests and

69

00:04:39,660  -->  00:04:45,840
learn how to what the differences are between demo tests and real test so basically I'll be using my

70

00:04:45,900  -->  00:04:53,370
live real account as a guinea pig to show you how a real tests can compare to demo tests and then we'll

71

00:04:53,370  -->  00:04:55,950
wrap up the tests and then we're going to the quiz.

72

00:04:55,980  -->  00:05:02,850
And finally at the end of the Course I've thrown in some additional bonus lectures on optimization tips

73

00:05:02,850  -->  00:05:09,750
and tricks so these are some tips and tricks and hacks that I use to make my optimizations more efficient

74

00:05:09,840  -->  00:05:11,760
and more effective.

75

00:05:11,760  -->  00:05:16,800
And here you will learn quite a lot of them so we'll talk about the recovery factor export results into

76

00:05:16,830  -->  00:05:17,790
Excel.

77

00:05:17,800  -->  00:05:19,250
The genetic algorithms there.

78

00:05:19,410  -->  00:05:21,420
We've also got a very interesting tutorial.

79

00:05:21,480  -->  00:05:27,360
So one I added recently is called that could quadruple genetic algorithm walk through and it's got a

80

00:05:27,360  -->  00:05:29,790
live example there so make sure to check that one out.

81

00:05:29,790  -->  00:05:36,210
He's got a very detailed and intuitive in my view a very intuitive explanation of the genetic algorithm

82

00:05:36,210  -->  00:05:36,580
.

83

00:05:36,640  -->  00:05:38,430
There was talk about rerolling optimization.

84

00:05:38,430  -->  00:05:39,800
So another quiz here.

85

00:05:39,900  -->  00:05:45,300
And finally the course conclusion where we will sum up everything that we learned and I'll wish you

86

00:05:45,870  -->  00:05:46,740
well on your way.

87

00:05:46,740  -->  00:05:53,010
So as you can see it's a quite a large course a lots of lectures a lot of fun in these lectures as well

88

00:05:53,010  -->  00:05:53,150
.

89

00:05:53,210  -->  00:05:57,650
A lot of practical applications and I can't wait to see on the first tutorial.

90

00:05:57,720  -->  00:05:59,800
Let's dive straight into it.

91

00:05:59,820  -->  00:06:01,510
And until then happy trading
