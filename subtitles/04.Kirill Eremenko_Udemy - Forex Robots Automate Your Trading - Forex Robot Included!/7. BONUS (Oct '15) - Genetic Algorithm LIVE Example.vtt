00:00:00.990  -->  00:00:07.380
Hello and welcome back to the course on testing and optimization This is Carol Manco and I'm adding

2

00:00:07.380  -->  00:00:11.500
this bonus video to the course in October 2015.

3

00:00:11.760  -->  00:00:16.110
I hope you're going really well off the course so far you're enjoying the videos and having lots of

4

00:00:16.110  -->  00:00:16.780
fun.

5

00:00:16.980  -->  00:00:23.440
And what I wanted to share today is a use case for the genetic algorithm in meditative form.

6

00:00:23.670  -->  00:00:29.160
Now we've already talked about the genetic algorithm and we know how it works but how can we use it

7

00:00:29.220  -->  00:00:35.180
to really really boost our algorithmic trading system optimization process.

8

00:00:35.310  -->  00:00:41.790
So today I'll show you one of the ways I use the algorithmic genetic algorithm in miniature form.

9

00:00:41.850  -->  00:00:43.990
So what am I got here in front of me.

10

00:00:44.130  -->  00:00:51.450
Well here I've got some optimization which I was running overnight and if I go to the settings this

11

00:00:51.450  -->  00:00:58.920
expert adviser actually has a lot of parameters and I was optimizing over 20 of them and the number

12

00:00:58.920  -->  00:01:03.190
of combinations for that optimization is indicated over here.

13

00:01:03.270  -->  00:01:05.460
So you can see that it's not.

14

00:01:05.500  -->  00:01:07.560
This is thousands this is millions.

15

00:01:07.590  -->  00:01:09.230
This is billions.

16

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:10.460
This is trillions.

17

00:01:10.470  -->  00:01:17.940
This is quadrillions and this is a quintillion So there's a quintillion over a quintillion all possible

18

00:01:17.940  -->  00:01:20.880
combination of the parameters that I'm optimizing.

19

00:01:20.970  -->  00:01:27.990
And as you can imagine you would need a supercomputer to get through all of these in brute force and

20

00:01:28.470  -->  00:01:32.550
even after you'd get all through all of them you would still have so much resultset then you would need

21

00:01:32.790  -->  00:01:37.980
another optimization to optimize the results of the first optimization.

22

00:01:38.040  -->  00:01:40.640
So that would be pretty insane.

23

00:01:40.770  -->  00:01:42.960
And this is where the genetic algorithm comes in handy.

24

00:01:42.960  -->  00:01:50.340
So as you can see the genetic algorithm really reduces the number of iterations it has to go through

25

00:01:50.370  -->  00:01:53.890
and I am able to still optimize on the every tick model.

26

00:01:54.120  -->  00:02:00.000
And now if I go to the optimization graph what have I done here will I've actually run four separate

27

00:02:00.060  -->  00:02:02.880
optimizations for the same expert adviser.

28

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:05.910
But every single time I've used the genetic algorithm.

29

00:02:05.910  -->  00:02:07.620
And what does that allow me to do.

30

00:02:07.740  -->  00:02:10.920
Well let me let me explain a picture actually.

31

00:02:11.430  -->  00:02:15.530
So why do I run four separate genetic algorithms at the same time.

32

00:02:15.540  -->  00:02:17.730
Why don't I just limit myself to one.

33

00:02:17.730  -->  00:02:22.560
Well let's say in a multidimensional space.

34

00:02:22.560  -->  00:02:27.660
These are all of the parameters that are all of the sets of parameters that the supervisor can have

35

00:02:27.660  -->  00:02:28.450
the ones that were up to us.

36

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:34.100
I know this is a bit of this is my drawing so I'm very proud of it.

37

00:02:34.260  -->  00:02:41.430
I know it's a bit it looks a bit unprofessional I would say but let's benefit that's the best I could

38

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:43.490
do in pain too if a mouse.

39

00:02:43.590  -->  00:02:48.930
Anyway so these are this is a multidimensional space where we have all of the parameters that the sexpert

40

00:02:48.960  -->  00:02:49.910
of us can possibly have.

41

00:02:50.040  -->  00:02:51.960
So how does the generic algorithm work.

42

00:02:51.960  -->  00:02:53.080
So it starts somewhere.

43

00:02:53.100  -->  00:02:57.330
Let's say one of them that say that top one that we just looked at on the right is so-so here.

44

00:02:57.330  -->  00:02:57.530
Right.

45

00:02:57.540  -->  00:03:00.050
And then it goes OK.

46

00:03:00.750  -->  00:03:03.750
Let's let me randomly try this parameter.

47

00:03:03.760  -->  00:03:05.670
OK that is better so I'm going to go this way.

48

00:03:05.680  -->  00:03:07.120
I'm going to go this way I'm going to go this way.

49

00:03:07.140  -->  00:03:10.920
OK that wasn't good so I'm going to I'm actually going to go this way this way this way this way this

50

00:03:10.920  -->  00:03:17.610
way and it gets somewhere and through those 10000 sets that it runs it gets somewhere and it's like

51

00:03:17.640  -->  00:03:19.690
OK so that's probably the best one.

52

00:03:19.690  -->  00:03:20.850
That's the second best one.

53

00:03:20.850  -->  00:03:22.080
That's the third best one and so on.

54

00:03:22.080  -->  00:03:24.410
So you have some sets to choose from.

55

00:03:24.420  -->  00:03:25.210
Then you go.

56

00:03:25.410  -->  00:03:30.780
So but the thing with the generic algorithm here is that it's limited so because it originally randomly

57

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:36.390
chose to go this way and then this way and this way this is this way it's never going to actually look

58

00:03:36.390  -->  00:03:40.410
through these sets or here or you'll never actually see these ones because they're too far away.

59

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:45.210
Think of it in terms of evolution like the human species right.

60

00:03:45.210  -->  00:03:46.600
It went this way this way this way.

61

00:03:46.600  -->  00:03:52.830
Like maybe those Neanderthals or parallel there was homo sapiens and eventually we ended up of homo

62

00:03:52.830  -->  00:03:53.220
sapiens.

63

00:03:53.220  -->  00:03:56.350
But you would never see a human evolve into a giraffe.

64

00:03:56.370  -->  00:03:56.640
Right.

65

00:03:56.640  -->  00:04:02.130
So if you go to a giraffe here or a human evolve into a tree or you know saw some other form of life

66

00:04:02.140  -->  00:04:08.490
we're here because completely completely different revolutionary pathways and it's too far away to ever

67

00:04:08.490  -->  00:04:08.760
happen.

68

00:04:08.760  -->  00:04:14.540
But you know maybe what you looking for in this particular case is a giraffe not a human.

69

00:04:14.700  -->  00:04:21.060
So that's why I'm running for you like I'm not going to get everything obviously because there's way

70

00:04:21.060  -->  00:04:26.460
too many these Quintilian but we're for I'm quadrupling my chances of getting what I want.

71

00:04:26.460  -->  00:04:32.400
So let's say the second one will run from here it will randomly start here and it'll go here we go here

72

00:04:32.400  -->  00:04:37.050
to go here and go here and it all intellectually can go this way this way this way this way this way

73

00:04:37.230  -->  00:04:38.860
this way or this way he'll come here.

74

00:04:38.970  -->  00:04:39.980
So then I'll say OK.

75

00:04:39.990  -->  00:04:43.650
So this is actually the best set and maybe this is the second best.

76

00:04:43.650  -->  00:04:46.460
This is the third best best and so on.

77

00:04:47.250  -->  00:04:51.570
Let's have a look another one and then maybe this one will start here and then it will go like that

78

00:04:51.590  -->  00:04:51.630
.

79

00:04:51.650  -->  00:04:53.560
I like that like that like that.

80

00:04:53.580  -->  00:04:54.620
I like that like that.

81

00:04:54.660  -->  00:04:55.010
I don't know.

82

00:04:55.010  -->  00:04:55.810
Somewhere.

83

00:04:55.950  -->  00:04:58.790
Maybe it'll end up back here and they'll say this was the best set.

84

00:04:58.800  -->  00:05:03.570
This was the second best third best kind of you get the picture so I'll just roll the fourth one for

85

00:05:03.570  -->  00:05:04.460
completeness sake.

86

00:05:04.560  -->  00:05:09.210
So maybe it started here then went this way this way this way this way this way this way and then it

87

00:05:09.210  -->  00:05:14.700
actually went on the same pathway and it found this one to be the best second best and maybe third best

88

00:05:14.700  -->  00:05:14.760
.

89

00:05:14.760  -->  00:05:15.940
Right.

90

00:05:16.050  -->  00:05:23.160
So by having four genetic algorithms running at the same time I'm really improving increasing the chances

91

00:05:23.160  -->  00:05:30.550
of finding diverse parameters so this one one genetic algorithm which you'll find is it generally Once

92

00:05:30.560  -->  00:05:33.800
it finds a profitable way like it sees that.

93

00:05:33.800  -->  00:05:36.170
OK so maybe stop loss of thirty six is profitable.

94

00:05:36.170  -->  00:05:38.030
I'm going to stick to stop loss of.

95

00:05:38.150  -->  00:05:42.040
It will rarely jump away from personal growth through 755.

96

00:05:42.200  -->  00:05:45.980
But then you'll see that there is six kind of a local extrem.

97

00:05:46.040  -->  00:05:48.630
It's a local maximum and I'll stick to it.

98

00:05:49.060  -->  00:05:55.310
And in the end everything that this genetic algorithm was optimizing will or more of the parameters

99

00:05:55.310  -->  00:06:01.480
will be with a stop loss of 36 whereas maybe you're not interested or you're more you know you want

100

00:06:01.480  -->  00:06:02.590
a higher Stop-Loss.

101

00:06:02.750  -->  00:06:08.960
That's why when you run for maybe this genetic algorithm will actually find a stop loss of 72 or 84

102

00:06:08.960  -->  00:06:09.650
or whatever.

103

00:06:09.770  -->  00:06:15.710
And that way you will be optimizing around a 4 which can also be a local extremum ad but they will never

104

00:06:15.710  -->  00:06:22.370
cross because this is a local extremum and this is a local extremum a local maximum for the stop all

105

00:06:22.400  -->  00:06:27.450
it's it yields the profit a maximum of profit.

106

00:06:27.540  -->  00:06:32.060
Around that stop loss and this stop loss yields and Maximov profit are on that supply.

107

00:06:32.060  -->  00:06:38.570
So if you visualize the graph or let's say Stop-Loss since we're talking about it that's a let's draw

108

00:06:38.620  -->  00:06:43.100
in another color so probably let's do what have we not done yet.

109

00:06:43.100  -->  00:06:43.870
Orange right.

110

00:06:43.910  -->  00:06:52.700
So if you got this is your profit and I apologize for the very very ugly joinings that's your profit

111

00:06:52.870  -->  00:06:54.090
and that's your stop loss.

112

00:06:54.250  -->  00:06:59.080
Maybe you've got your stop loss like around what did we say.

113

00:06:59.210  -->  00:07:00.920
Thirty six right.

114

00:07:00.920  -->  00:07:02.240
That's your profit goes up.

115

00:07:02.240  -->  00:07:05.510
And then it's like like it's pretty low pretty low.

116

00:07:05.500  -->  00:07:06.860
And then all right.

117

00:07:06.860  -->  00:07:11.830
So let's say you're 36 here you're 84 is over there.

118

00:07:11.960  -->  00:07:17.750
So that genetic algorithm the green on what it found was at 36 is good and it tried to go left to try

119

00:07:17.750  -->  00:07:22.380
to go this way try to go that way but it found that 36 is really good and we're going to stick with

120

00:07:22.380  -->  00:07:22.990
86.

121

00:07:23.150  -->  00:07:27.800
And what the other one followed the red one was it found that 84 is actually really good because it

122

00:07:27.800  -->  00:07:31.720
randomly started closer to 84 and it couldn't find anything better.

123

00:07:31.730  -->  00:07:37.720
Around 84 so it'll stick to 84 and that's how the genetic algorithm works so if you just launch one

124

00:07:37.730  -->  00:07:44.000
you might find yourself stuck at one of these local extremisms for profit and not being able to find

125

00:07:44.000  -->  00:07:44.850
other parameters.

126

00:07:44.990  -->  00:07:50.160
That's why personally I prefer to launch a couple of genetic algorithms at the same time.

127

00:07:50.240  -->  00:07:55.430
In this case you saw four of them running that's what I normally do because for me I've calculated for

128

00:07:55.510  -->  00:08:03.910
maximizes my utilization of my machine my computer so I can launch it overnight and because I don't

129

00:08:03.920  -->  00:08:08.080
need the computer it can all completely be dedicated to optimization.

130

00:08:08.090  -->  00:08:13.880
And that way all of the research resources are utilized if I launch five.

131

00:08:14.030  -->  00:08:20.390
Kind of like they're sharing and the optimization won't be complete by morning or or the computer will

132

00:08:20.380  -->  00:08:21.650
crash.

133

00:08:21.640  -->  00:08:23.650
So one of the one of the two things will happen.

134

00:08:23.810  -->  00:08:31.760
So there you go that is why I run for genetic algorithms at the same time and that is one of the use

135

00:08:31.750  -->  00:08:33.570
cases for genetic algorithms.

136

00:08:33.670  -->  00:08:36.110
And just to you know have a look at the results.

137

00:08:36.380  -->  00:08:42.100
You can see here that the starting balls was 10000 and you can see that the genetic algorithm did a

138

00:08:42.110  -->  00:08:42.850
great job.

139

00:08:42.880  -->  00:08:46.450
It it increased from like some some of them went down.

140

00:08:46.660  -->  00:08:51.340
So what we saw in that lovely picture that I drew some of them went down and then went up.

141

00:08:51.350  -->  00:08:53.520
But generally you can see this curve is going up.

142

00:08:53.510  -->  00:08:56.720
So this is the final balance on the count.

143

00:08:56.840  -->  00:09:05.570
And you can see that overall it is like it got me two results where I can be earning 17000 or you can

144

00:09:05.570  -->  00:09:08.710
be earning $7000 and this is the period of 36 six days.

145

00:09:08.720  -->  00:09:10.400
Right so 36 days.

146

00:09:10.390  -->  00:09:16.300
And this expert Yser conducts maybe about Ideally I wanted to conduct over 100 trades in 36 days but

147

00:09:16.310  -->  00:09:21.050
that's a completely different story you know that's my preferences and you know statistical significance

148

00:09:21.050  -->  00:09:22.110
and things like that.

149

00:09:22.220  -->  00:09:27.350
What we're talking about here is genetic algorithm and you can see that in this case it got up to $7200

150

00:09:27.350  -->  00:09:29.910
a profiteer six thousand eight hundred.

151

00:09:30.010  -->  00:09:35.480
Here is about six maybe about $7000 a profit here is about 6000.

152

00:09:35.480  -->  00:09:37.180
What is it about another 7000.

153

00:09:37.340  -->  00:09:44.270
And you know then I will go into the results and I will look through all of these parameters and look

154

00:09:44.270  -->  00:09:47.390
through all of them and I'll be like OK so what am I interested in.

155

00:09:47.380  -->  00:09:49.610
All right so my interest in maximum profit they are.

156

00:09:49.630  -->  00:09:51.530
So they go seven thousand five hundred.

157

00:09:51.620  -->  00:09:51.830
Right.

158

00:09:51.830  -->  00:09:52.730
That's the total trade.

159

00:09:52.750  -->  00:09:56.780
Those of you who know me well know that probably you might go for total trades right.

160

00:09:56.780  -->  00:09:58.560
I will go for total trade I'll be OK.

161

00:09:58.580  -->  00:10:01.510
So even there's less profit here and a higher drawdown.

162

00:10:01.610  -->  00:10:06.850
But I can see that there's more total trade so I will still investigate that one because for me it is

163

00:10:06.860  -->  00:10:08.380
more statistically significant.

164

00:10:08.480  -->  00:10:11.250
But once again that's a whole different story.

165

00:10:11.340  -->  00:10:18.620
The the main the main takeaway from here is that the generic algorithm works works pretty well.

166

00:10:18.630  -->  00:10:23.570
And but if you don't want to get stuck in a local extremum of one of the or multiple of your parameters

167

00:10:23.810  -->  00:10:29.780
if you don't explore a biro just like a diverse range of options then a way to solve that problem is

168

00:10:29.780  -->  00:10:35.490
to look at several genetic algorithms running in peril and make machines make sure that they don't crash

169

00:10:35.500  -->  00:10:36.450
your machine.

170

00:10:36.500  -->  00:10:38.740
So there we go that's all for us for today.

171

00:10:38.960  -->  00:10:41.830
Hope you're enjoying the course and hope you continue enjoying the course.

172

00:10:41.870  -->  00:10:44.270
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

173

00:10:44.300  -->  00:10:45.980
Until then happy trading
