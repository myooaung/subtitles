00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:02,820
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:02,820  -->  00:00:06,770
And welcome back to the course on backtesting and optimization.

3

00:00:06,780  -->  00:00:12,090
And today we've got a new version of simple system out and I wanted to share it with you and tell you

4

00:00:12,090  -->  00:00:12,840
what it's all about.

5

00:00:12,840  -->  00:00:18,690
So if you go to the original page where you download simple system for example dot com slash simple

6

00:00:18,900  -->  00:00:25,370
hyphen system and scroll down you'll see that the latest version now is not 5 point 0 or even 7.

7

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:26,940
It's eight point nine.

8

00:00:27,330  -->  00:00:31,830
And if you go down to the download section you will be able to get the new version here.

9

00:00:31,980  -->  00:00:34,590
So there's a few details about what's new.

10

00:00:34,590  -->  00:00:40,440
But I wanted to bring to your attention the most important new adjustment or a new model that I have

11

00:00:40,440  -->  00:00:41,030
added to it.

12

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:43,040
So let's go ahead and look at that.

13

00:00:43,590  -->  00:00:50,610
And here I've got a four digit Broecker account open and I've got the simple system in strategy tester

14

00:00:50,610  -->  00:00:51,390
at the bottom.

15

00:00:51,390  -->  00:00:57,090
Now a lot of the stuff we haven't talked about yet at this stage of the course you will get to see it

16

00:00:57,240  -->  00:01:04,170
further through the course but bear with me just let's focus on the parameters of this new expert advisor

17

00:01:04,170  -->  00:01:04,560
.

18

00:01:04,590  -->  00:01:10,830
So in this simple system version eight point nine you can see that you're able to enter the variables

19

00:01:10,830  -->  00:01:16,140
over here so they start out with a limit take profits stop loss and so on.

20

00:01:16,260  -->  00:01:22,680
And also you'll see that there's a new parameter which was added in Version 7 which is trail value.

21

00:01:22,770  -->  00:01:27,300
But nevertheless after you've done your optimization backtesting which we'll talk about further.

22

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:32,480
Of course you'll have a set of parameters that you're ready to use with this expert adviser and let's

23

00:01:32,490  -->  00:01:36,230
for instance run this expert advisor and see what results we get.

24

00:01:36,240  -->  00:01:42,780
So I'm running on the period of the last three months so from in February March and from April 2015

25

00:01:42,780  -->  00:01:45,180
to July 2015.

26

00:01:45,360  -->  00:01:51,570
And so if I run that you will see that there our graph and this is a result result that or a set of

27

00:01:51,570  -->  00:01:53,910
parameters are pretty much got off the top of my head.

28

00:01:53,930  -->  00:01:55,580
It's already shown some good results.

29

00:01:55,710  -->  00:02:00,760
Further Of course you will see how to get even better results with this expert adviser.

30

00:02:00,900  -->  00:02:04,840
But for now we're going to focus on is our type of account.

31

00:02:04,840  -->  00:02:09,740
So this broker this account is a four digit account and you can see that here in the market watch me

32

00:02:09,780  -->  00:02:16,080
window you can see that all of the prices are 4 digits or for the yen currency pairs.

33

00:02:16,080  -->  00:02:17,280
There are two digits.

34

00:02:17,340  -->  00:02:22,920
Now what happens when you move over to a five digit broker or if you even if you start off a five digit

35

00:02:22,920  -->  00:02:23,640
account right away.

36

00:02:23,640  -->  00:02:31,170
So let's open one up here I've got as you can see here is a different account and here I've got five

37

00:02:31,170  -->  00:02:35,740
digits in all of my currency pairs and three digits in the yen currency pairs.

38

00:02:35,850  -->  00:02:37,290
And this is a different broker.

39

00:02:37,290  -->  00:02:43,830
This is roba for X dollars for X for you so here you can see the difference right away there's an extra

40

00:02:43,830  -->  00:02:45,810
digit in all of the currency pairs.

41

00:02:46,020  -->  00:02:55,380
And this has always been a under-water stone that has tripped up a lot of algorithmic trading traders

42

00:02:55,410  -->  00:03:03,570
because once you move on to you New onto this five digit type of account your expert adviser might not

43

00:03:03,570  -->  00:03:04,630
be able to handle it.

44

00:03:04,770  -->  00:03:10,590
And here if we enter the same exact parameters so I'll just open these to this window first so if I

45

00:03:10,590  -->  00:03:15,130
go to setting's expert adviser parameters here they are.

46

00:03:15,390  -->  00:03:21,540
And if I go to my five digit window or five digit account and go to the parameters you will see that

47

00:03:21,540  -->  00:03:26,010
they're pretty much the same except for a change of startHour because there is a time shift between

48

00:03:26,010  -->  00:03:30,740
the two brokers and once again that's something we also cover in this course.

49

00:03:30,930  -->  00:03:36,270
But for now what we're looking at is that the main parameters take profits stop loss minute people who

50

00:03:36,270  -->  00:03:40,470
are in exactly the same as in the four digit account.

51

00:03:40,470  -->  00:03:43,680
Now let's go ahead and run this and see what we get.

52

00:03:43,680  -->  00:03:50,190
So if we were on this now on the same time period same currency pair same timeframe and we look at the

53

00:03:50,200  -->  00:03:53,700
result and it's a complete loss.

54

00:03:53,730  -->  00:03:59,880
So why does that happen why when we move from a four digit account to 5 digit account why do we get

55

00:04:00,150  -->  00:04:01,680
this change.

56

00:04:01,680  -->  00:04:03,060
Drastic change in results.

57

00:04:03,060  -->  00:04:10,410
So here you can see this is the original graph the end result of all back tests and this result of a

58

00:04:10,410  -->  00:04:12,520
back test is completely negative.

59

00:04:12,660  -->  00:04:20,400
But also what you can see is that on this chart the stop loss or the stop losses like for instance here

60

00:04:20,400  -->  00:04:27,880
that's a stop loss and take profits for instance that that looks like a take profit over there.

61

00:04:27,930  -->  00:04:30,600
They're much greater than the ones on this chart.

62

00:04:31,020  -->  00:04:35,820
And what that is telling us is that their experience Wiser's not correctly recognizing the parameters

63

00:04:35,830  -->  00:04:37,270
we're inputting.

64

00:04:37,500  -->  00:04:47,370
That is because expert Wiser's think in terms of points rather than Pipp So here we're putting 4 1960

65

00:04:47,370  -->  00:04:49,850
just as we were in the four digit account.

66

00:04:49,860  -->  00:05:00,030
But in the 5 digit account is recognized as 4 points so four of those last of the last decimal of the

67

00:05:00,030  -->  00:05:00,720
currency pair.

68

00:05:00,710  -->  00:05:07,170
So what we normally would have to do to correct this behavior is to change all these parameters and

69

00:05:07,350  -->  00:05:08,400
multiply them by 10.

70

00:05:08,400  -->  00:05:09,620
So if you go ahead and do that.

71

00:05:09,690  -->  00:05:16,200
So all of the parameters relating to points including all Trel value is not used here so we don't have

72

00:05:16,200  -->  00:05:20,850
to multiply but we would have to multiply it if we were using it.

73

00:05:20,850  -->  00:05:26,970
So if we are now an expert advisor you will see that we're getting pretty much the same Charsadda exactly

74

00:05:26,970  -->  00:05:34,670
the same but that is due to differences in quotations and historical data between the two brokers.

75

00:05:35,010  -->  00:05:39,510
But once again we're not focusing on that what we're focusing on is now that we have corrected the behavior

76

00:05:39,510  -->  00:05:43,990
of the wise and is recognizing our parameters properly.

77

00:05:44,010  -->  00:05:49,780
Now that is kind of a headache to always remember to multiply your parameters by 10.

78

00:05:50,100  -->  00:05:55,770
And if you worked with expert advisors between four digit and five digit brokers before you will know

79

00:05:56,610  -->  00:06:03,750
how you sometimes you might forget to do it or sometimes you know you'd always have to remember to do

80

00:06:03,750  -->  00:06:06,810
it for all of your expert advice if you don't want to be doing that all the time.

81

00:06:06,810  -->  00:06:11,840
So a smart expert advises have these things coded in them.

82

00:06:11,850  -->  00:06:18,480
And finally simple system has become one of those areas and you can see I've added a module which is

83

00:06:18,480  -->  00:06:20,340
called Auro handle five digits.

84

00:06:20,370  -->  00:06:28,770
And now we'll just turn everything back to the original values of the parameters so for 1960.

85

00:06:28,770  -->  00:06:35,730
And if I change the handle digit from false to true you will see that nothing changes here but the behavior

86

00:06:35,730  -->  00:06:40,770
of the expert was all changed so first off we will keep it at false and we'll have a look and see that

87

00:06:40,770  -->  00:06:43,110
it could be behaving incorrectly.

88

00:06:43,320  -->  00:06:46,320
And now we will change it to True and see what happens.

89

00:06:46,320  -->  00:06:47,920
So I'm going to change it to true.

90

00:06:48,060  -->  00:06:49,740
OK start.

91

00:06:50,150  -->  00:06:54,060
And as you can see the expert advice has adjusted its behavior.

92

00:06:54,090  -->  00:06:59,180
It recognizes that it is working on a five digit account.

93

00:06:59,310  -->  00:07:01,710
Moreover this is actually a very smart module.

94

00:07:01,710  -->  00:07:07,350
It doesn't only just bluntly multiply everything by 10 or something like that.

95

00:07:07,350  -->  00:07:09,330
Like other expert devices would have.

96

00:07:09,330  -->  00:07:16,110
This one is a smart one so you can keep it on true even on a four digit account like we're going back

97

00:07:16,110  -->  00:07:17,720
to the four digit account now.

98

00:07:18,030  -->  00:07:22,860
And if I switch it on here so if I go down you can see it's actually switched on so for a four digit

99

00:07:22,860  -->  00:07:25,810
account if it's off you'll get a good result.

100

00:07:25,830  -->  00:07:29,500
You'll get the parameters recognized properly recognize properly.

101

00:07:29,730  -->  00:07:38,280
And if we switch it on you will still get the same results so there won't be any unnecessary multiplication

102

00:07:38,280  -->  00:07:44,430
by 10 or adjusting of parameters because the expert adviser actually knows how to recognize a four digit

103

00:07:44,520  -->  00:07:46,690
account from a five digit account.

104

00:07:47,100  -->  00:07:54,410
So all you have to do is keep this parameter or this module on and be careful it is on by default in

105

00:07:54,420  -->  00:07:57,800
this expert advice so that is very important for you to be aware of.

106

00:07:57,900  -->  00:08:03,570
You keep it on by default and then you can always from now and specify all the parameters in four digit

107

00:08:03,600  -->  00:08:06,320
mode you don't have to manually multiply by 10.

108

00:08:06,390  -->  00:08:12,840
And moreover you should be careful because if you already have a saved set of parameters for your 5

109

00:08:12,840  -->  00:08:17,570
digit account so if I go back to the 5 digit account here.

110

00:08:17,880  -->  00:08:22,660
So let's say for instance you already have some primers saved for a five digit account.

111

00:08:22,770  -->  00:08:28,520
If you load them into this new expert advice they will probably be already multiplied by 10.

112

00:08:28,620  -->  00:08:33,820
And also you will have this automatically set to true so that will mean that if you're launching expert

113

00:08:33,960  -->  00:08:38,150
like that you will double up and your stop loss and take profit will be out of whack.

114

00:08:38,160  -->  00:08:40,370
So be careful of that.

115

00:08:40,410  -->  00:08:49,410
Make sure if you move on to version eight point nine or simple system that you either re reset your

116

00:08:49,710  -->  00:08:57,990
variables in four digit mode or you switch off this new module by default the new module is always on

117

00:08:57,990  -->  00:08:58,610
.

118

00:08:58,620  -->  00:09:01,910
So that's the main change in system simple system.

119

00:09:01,910  -->  00:09:03,080
Eight point nine.

120

00:09:03,090  -->  00:09:09,990
Now when you're trading on a five digit account you can not worry about multiplying all of your parameters

121

00:09:09,990  -->  00:09:13,370
by 10 because the expert Yser can do that for you.

122

00:09:13,470  -->  00:09:16,440
And that module is on by default.

123

00:09:16,440  -->  00:09:17,490
Hope that it was helpful.

124

00:09:17,490  -->  00:09:21,090
Hope you're enjoying simple system let me know in the common section of what you think.

125

00:09:21,090  -->  00:09:29,250
If you have any sort of recommendations for using this expert adviser going forward or any ideas for

126

00:09:29,880  -->  00:09:34,990
new modules for expert advisor this this idea actually came from one of the students.

127

00:09:35,100  -->  00:09:39,830
He also wanted this for five digit recognition so always open to new suggestions.

128

00:09:39,840  -->  00:09:41,580
And I look for see you throughout the course.

129

00:09:41,730  -->  00:09:43,170
Until then happy trading
