00:00:07.890  -->  00:00:10.210
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:10.240  -->  00:00:16.680
And welcome to the third tutorial and of course on testing and optimization meditator for the produce

3

00:00:16.680  -->  00:00:20.400
tutorial we learn how to navigate the strategy tester window.

4

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:23.460
And today we're going to be talking about backtesting.

5

00:00:23.460  -->  00:00:30.000
So what is a back test and what is the process of backtesting it was the PTA defines backtesting as

6

00:00:30.000  -->  00:00:35.560
the process of testing and trading strategy and prior time periods instead of applying a strategy for

7

00:00:35.560  -->  00:00:38.420
the time period forward which could take years.

8

00:00:38.460  -->  00:00:44.190
A trader can do a simulation of his or her training strategy on relevant past data in order to gauge

9

00:00:44.190  -->  00:00:45.400
its effectiveness.

10

00:00:45.420  -->  00:00:47.170
So what does that mean reality.

11

00:00:47.330  -->  00:00:53.440
Let's draw a timeline and let's put a cross on the timeline to a present today.

12

00:00:53.550  -->  00:01:01.170
And you think to the left of the of the cross is the past and the dashed line to the right is the future

13

00:01:01.890  -->  00:01:07.980
for us to evaluate the effectiveness of a trading strategy we would have to launch it today and then

14

00:01:07.980  -->  00:01:15.540
wait a sufficient number of time for the strategy to accumulate a certain number of trades that would

15

00:01:15.540  -->  00:01:21.390
allow us to say whether the strategy is effective or not depending on the strategy it could take from

16

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:26.440
several weeks to several months or possibly even a year.

17

00:01:26.580  -->  00:01:33.370
Therefore we can use backtesting to significantly limit the amount of time that we require to evaluate

18

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:34.890
effectiveness of our strategy.

19

00:01:34.890  -->  00:01:37.680
Backtesting involves selecting two points in the past.

20

00:01:37.680  -->  00:01:44.670
Point A and Point B and then using the data between these two points to run a simulated test of our

21

00:01:44.670  -->  00:01:51.600
trading strategy and based on that test we can evaluate whether our trading strategy would have been

22

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:54.620
effective if it were launched in the past.

23

00:01:54.990  -->  00:02:00.250
And based on that evaluation we can decide for ourselves whether we want to launch it today or not.

24

00:02:00.270  -->  00:02:08.100
And that way we really can speed up the process of evaluation of training strategies and save ourselves

25

00:02:08.100  -->  00:02:09.260
a lot of time.

26

00:02:09.270  -->  00:02:15.030
There are a few special cases of back tests for example you could select only one point in the past

27

00:02:15.090  -->  00:02:21.780
and then run the back test all the way up to today or you could select the point in the past as the

28

00:02:21.780  -->  00:02:25.280
very first point from which you have data.

29

00:02:25.440  -->  00:02:31.260
And that way you'll have a full back test which includes the whole of the data set that's available

30

00:02:31.260  -->  00:02:31.780
to you.

31

00:02:32.130  -->  00:02:38.250
And choosing these points the starting point and the ending point really depends on the trading strategy

32

00:02:38.260  -->  00:02:38.620
.

33

00:02:39.030  -->  00:02:45.390
For example for training strategies working on high timeframes you might want to use several months

34

00:02:45.390  -->  00:02:52.170
or years of data and for training strategies working on lower timeframes such as the five minutes or

35

00:02:52.170  -->  00:02:57.720
15 minutes timeframe maybe a month or even several weeks of data would be sufficient for a back test

36

00:02:57.740  -->  00:02:57.920
.

37

00:02:58.080  -->  00:03:04.740
So let's go to Medtner for now and just run our very first back test here.

38

00:03:04.740  -->  00:03:12.750
You can select any of the two expert advisors available to select any chart any period.

39

00:03:13.020  -->  00:03:18.380
I recommend selecting control points at this stage just to speed things up.

40

00:03:18.690  -->  00:03:22.410
You can choose the dates here these are the two points in time.

41

00:03:22.470  -->  00:03:28.050
I'm not going to choose any dates and that way the test will run on the full data set that's available

42

00:03:28.050  -->  00:03:35.120
to me will click visual mode so we can see how this is progressing and then we'll just click start over

43

00:03:35.120  -->  00:03:42.300
here as you continue chart has appeared and a simulation has begun.

44

00:03:42.300  -->  00:03:49.220
So a trader for takes on that responsibility of running the simulation for you.

45

00:03:49.410  -->  00:03:54.820
And this as you can see the date here is 30th April 2014.

46

00:03:55.040  -->  00:04:02.460
And today's It is already august 2014 but better trader 4 is behaving as if this is happening real time

47

00:04:02.460  -->  00:04:02.670
.

48

00:04:02.670  -->  00:04:08.940
And as you can see that allows you to control the speed here you can like set the speed to slow and

49

00:04:08.940  -->  00:04:17.970
therefore everything is happening much or you can set the speed too much faster and therefore you're

50

00:04:17.970  -->  00:04:26.850
condensing this time that actually happened within days so every bar here you see is actually a an hour

51

00:04:26.850  -->  00:04:26.920
.

52

00:04:26.980  -->  00:04:27.550
You go.

53

00:04:27.570  -->  00:04:34.620
We have our first trade that was opened and there was a buy order which which created a loss.

54

00:04:34.740  -->  00:04:43.560
So as I was saying every bar here is a hour but it's happening in a matter of less than a second.

55

00:04:43.680  -->  00:04:46.990
And that that's how you can actually save time and back.

56

00:04:47.790  -->  00:04:53.730
Now you can see what's what's happening and this might be a profitable by ordre here that's about be

57

00:04:53.880  -->  00:04:57.140
closed hopefully.

58

00:04:58.380  -->  00:04:58.810
There we go.

59

00:04:58.810  -->  00:05:01.920
There was a profitable buy order if you go to the graph.

60

00:05:01.920  -->  00:05:08.340
The graph shows you how your balance is changing with time.

61

00:05:08.340  -->  00:05:10.950
So this is actually turn out of time of every trade.

62

00:05:10.950  -->  00:05:17.740
So we started with $10000 and you can see here how your balance is going up and down.

63

00:05:17.940  -->  00:05:24.060
Journal shows you some journals on what the expert wise is doing.

64

00:05:24.060  -->  00:05:30.420
Results actually lists every single trade that's been opened it's closed open or closed and so on and

65

00:05:30.420  -->  00:05:35.250
you can see the profit that every trade is bringing you the reports on trading the report will be ready

66

00:05:35.250  -->  00:05:41.520
at the end and at the bottom here of the green lines is the volume so as soon as they are two at least

67

00:05:41.520  -->  00:05:44.640
two trades with different volumes this line will appear and we'll show you.

68

00:05:44.790  -->  00:05:52.350
So this was point one loss and the all the previous ones were point to lots and that is built into the

69

00:05:52.350  -->  00:05:53.260
trade strategy.

70

00:05:53.310  -->  00:05:55.770
So I'll just speed this up to the maximum.

71

00:05:55.770  -->  00:06:01.470
And as you can see it's finished the test finishes very quickly when you speed up to the maximum.

72

00:06:02.040  -->  00:06:02.610
And there you go.

73

00:06:02.610  -->  00:06:09.060
So that was your first back test obviously because this prepackaged expert adviser and it has been optimized

74

00:06:09.070  -->  00:06:09.250
.

75

00:06:09.420  -->  00:06:18.540
It created a loss on the account but that is something that we'll discuss in other tutorials and we'll

76

00:06:18.540  -->  00:06:23.140
look at profitable expert advisors through this course going forward.

77

00:06:23.340  -->  00:06:28.350
So that that's that hopefully you enjoyed this tutorial and possibly learn something new.

78

00:06:28.380  -->  00:06:34.830
I would like to invite you to visit my website at WW dot for example dot com where you can find this

and many more other free tutorials and I look forward to seeing you next time.

80

00:06:39.990  -->  00:06:42.120
