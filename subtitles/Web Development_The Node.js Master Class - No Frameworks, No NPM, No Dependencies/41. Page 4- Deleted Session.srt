00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,210
in this lecture,

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,250
we're going to set up the ability for the users to log out after they've locked in.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,190
Unlike creating an account,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,840
logging Out doesn't need a page of its own.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,710
But we do need to create a page to send users to after they've successfully logged out.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,450
And so,

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,590
rather than being a log out page is going to be a you have been locked out page that is

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,370
going to be called session deleted,

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:34,250
as you can see in our server router session slash deleted his handlers dot session deleted

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:42,850
so we can go to our handlers and create that new one using the last one as a base.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:51,050
So we're going to say that session has been deleted.

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,610
That's going to be handlers.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,750
Session deleted.

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,030
Still,

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,650
only going to accept to get the title was going to be logged out.

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:16,660
The description is going to be You have been logged out of your account and the body class

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,170
session deleted the template.

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,050
We want to get his session deleted and everything else could be the same.

19
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,250
Now we can create that template.

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,450
Templates slash session deleted dot html,

21
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,020
like the others are just walking through what we written here.

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,250
Title was logged out.

23
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,780
We tell them you've been logged out of your account and there's just a call to action but

24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,750
saying Log in again.

25
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:55,130
Now we have to make some modifications app dot Js To bind any log out button so that it can

26
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,770
trigger an actual log out and buy logged out.

27
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:06,020
We need to send a request with the http method delete to a P I slash tokens to actually get

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,090
rid of that token,

29
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,290
and then we want to delete it from our local storage and front and library.

30
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:20,470
But first we need to update our header so that the law go but and has a specific I D that

31
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,440
we can bind to.

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,180
Now that that set up,

33
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,650
we can update this file.

34
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,520
It's walking through what's happening here.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,870
A session delish Inform Handler has been created.

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,570
A log user out function has been created apt out,

37
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,600
log user out,

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:43,400
which actually sends the delete that I mentioned a moment ago and then redirects users to

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,710
the session slash deleted page that we just created.

40
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,830
We also have added a app dot bind log out button function,

41
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,170
which is going to automatically bind the log up and in the menu so that any time it's

42
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,860
clicked,

43
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,210
the app dot love user out function gets called now that logging in and logging out should

44
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,980
be working.

45
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:12,230
We can also demo the fact that the menu should be expanding and contracting based on the

46
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,500
state of the user.

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,400
So let's go ahead and start the app up and try this all out,

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,950
going to refresh the log in page,

49
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,950
get rid of this console and then log in like I did a moment ago.

50
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,670
As you can see now,

51
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,790
I am logged out and the only things that I can see on the menu are home.

52
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,350
Sign up and log in.

53
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,700
That's what we want.

54
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:51,980
I'm looking in with four and 51234569 and this is a password.

55
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,880
Now I'm logged in and I'm taken to the checks all page.

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,750
But if I return to the home page,

57
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm still logged in the checks.

58
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,660
All page doesn't exist,

59
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,200
and so we can't see much there.

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,590
But the home page exists,

61
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,270
and we can see that my links appear have changed.

62
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,720
I now have home dashboard account settings and log out the log out.

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,000
But it's something I can click.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,160
So I click it and I'm sent to the You have been logged out page,

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,900
which means that I clicked the log out but in a post was made to delete my token,

66
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,680
and my token was actually deleted from the server.

67
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,200
And then I got rid of a client side as well.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,850
If we try to log out the active token,

69
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,790
you can see that it doesn't exist.

70
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:50,080
So logging out and logging in as well as the disappearing in reappearing menu items all

71
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,350
seem to be working fine so we can move on to the next lecture.
