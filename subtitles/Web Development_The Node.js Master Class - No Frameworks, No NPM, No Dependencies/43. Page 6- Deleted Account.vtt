00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
now that users can create an account,

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.410
view the settings of their account and update those settings,

3
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.030
we need to allow them to delete their account as well.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.530
That is another route that we've already added to the server account slash Deleted.

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.640
Which maps to handlers dot account lead it.

6
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.650
So I'm gonna go to the handlers file and once again,

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:32.090
copy this and go ahead in place and account deleted page below this one.

8
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.720
Just like the session deleted page.

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.970
This page is not a designated page for you to delete your account.

10
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.530
It is the page you are taken to after you have deleted your account.

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.290
We're also going to modify the account edit page to provide 1/3 form that will allow the

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.500
users to delete their account.

13
00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.960
So we want to say that this page is account has been deleted and that its name is account

14
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.650
deleted.

15
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.650
The title is going to be account deleted,

16
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.770
and we will need a meta description.

17
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.080
So head dot description because this is a public page,

18
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.750
the description will be your account has been deleted and the body class is account deleted

19
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.750
.

20
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.960
Lastly,

21
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.500
the template that should be fetched is account diluted.

22
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.800
So let's go ahead and create that template.

23
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:49.050
Touch templates slash account deleted dot html and we can see it in here inside of it.

24
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.850
We're just going to pace from or get Hub.

25
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.200
It has a header,

26
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.600
a sub header and a link telling the user you can go here to sign up again.

27
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.410
Now,

28
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.160
as mentioned,

29
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.350
we also need to update this account edit page to include another form.

30
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.300
So we're gonna pace that in here and you can see there's 1/3 form now called Account at It

31
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.950
three,

32
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.550
which actually sends a delete to a P I slash users.

33
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.550
We also need to update app dot Js a little.

34
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.890
And now we have done so The owning,

35
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.990
meaningful update that we did hear waas setting a form success call back to automatically

36
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.070
redirect the user to the account slash deleted page.

37
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.240
If they successfully submit the form account,

38
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.920
Edit three,

39
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.050
which is the one that deletes their account.

40
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.150
I'm going to start this silver back up.

41
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:56.580
I'm going to go ahead and log in again with that user we've been using and then navigate to

42
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.880
the account settings page.

43
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.780
Now we can see the two forms that we were used to.

44
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.140
That's what was 1/3 form for.

45
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.180
Delete your account.

46
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.730
We're giving them a warning.

47
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.300
This action cannot be undone.

48
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.410
Don't Clinton this button on accident.

49
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.150
But we're going to click it anyway.

50
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
And now her account is gone.

51
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.190
If we attempt to log in again,

52
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.570
we hit an error message.

53
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.570
Could not find the specified user.

54
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.520
If we go to our data,

55
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.460
we can see that for 151234569 doesn't exist anymore.

56
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.740
And if you remember on our back and lectures,

57
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.820
we've already set it up so that if this user had any checks associated with their account,

58
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.840
those would automatically have been purged out of the system as well or a P I handles all

59
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.200
that.

60
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.970
So account deletion seems to be working.

61
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.000
Since the account is totally gone,

62
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.650
I can go ahead and sign up again with the same user.

63
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:15.540
4151234569 And once again,

64
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.320
we're back into the account account.

65
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.580
Deletion seems to be working fine so we can move on to the next lecture.
