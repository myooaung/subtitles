00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
in this short lecture,

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.670
we're just going to fill out the index page so that it presents a blurb and some links that

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.820
allow user to access their account or sign in or sign up or what have you?

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.720
The first thing that we need to do is update the handler for index.

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.640
So that includes some riel metadata.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.750
So we want to set the title in the head to up time monitoring made simple.

7
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.030
And you consider to whatever you want the description,

8
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.060
the meta description.

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:50.780
I'm going to say we offer free simple up time monitoring for HDP shouldn't ps sites of all

10
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.660
kinds.

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.050
When your site goes down,

12
00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:04.370
we'll send you a text to let you know we won't be using the body title anymore.

13
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.420
That was just an example so that you could see how template ing worked within the index

14
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.050
template.

15
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.000
But we will be using the body class set to index.

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.470
As I mentioned before.

17
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.230
Our CSS file already includes the CSS that will need for this page and so we don't need to

18
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.140
add any more.

19
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.740
We just need to update the actual template here.

20
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.500
I'm gonna update this h one to say up time monitoring.

21
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.500
I'm gonna add an age to that,

22
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.050
says made simple.

23
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.630
That's kind of the slogan of this application.

24
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.650
Now I want to add a blurb in the middle of the page.

25
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.040
I'm just going to say it's a game for the class blurb and this blur was just going to say

26
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.160
the same thing that we said in the meta description.

27
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.150
So I'm just going to copy that from here.

28
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.390
Now we want to put it called Action that are gonna be Wrapped in a day of So that they

29
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.350
could be centered.

30
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.950
And so the day of the Wrapped in is called C T a rapper,

31
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:17.850
and we have to see T A's that are both links both a tags with classes.

32
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.140
One of them is going to link to account slash create,

33
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.750
which is where you should go.

34
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.750
If you want to sign up,

35
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:38.700
it's going to say get started and we're gonna have another link right next to it.

36
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.150
That's a C T a and blue,

37
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.050
and it's going to link to a session.

38
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.150
Slash create and it will be called lock in.

39
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.990
With CSS already in place,

40
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.450
we can start this up and see what it looks like.

41
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.590
So that is the home page of our application.

42
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.150
Just to spread this out a bit and push the footer down,

43
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.250
I'm going to add some Lauren Ipsum text here.

44
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.350
Say that again.

45
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.980
Now it's important point.

46
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.530
Since we are reading in these templates at the moment of the http request,

47
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.300
we don't need to restart the server in order to be able to reload the page and see the new

48
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.330
template there being read off the file system at the moment of the HDP request.

49
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.370
So there we go.

50
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.280
Now it's looking more like a normal website.

51
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.660
We can click here to get started.

52
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.970
Click here again and later on this menu will be changed so that someone who's viewing it

53
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.690
and is locked out will only see sign up and log it.

54
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.710
So that's all we need to do for the index file for the root of our website.

55
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.650
And now we can move on to the next lecture
