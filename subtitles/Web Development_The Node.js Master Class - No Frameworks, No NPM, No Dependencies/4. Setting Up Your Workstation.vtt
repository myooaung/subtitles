00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790
In order to complete this course,

2
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.240
you will need a few things.

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.640
A text editor access to the terminal node,

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.760
version eight and some of the example code.

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.500
Let's go over those in detail.

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.340
First,

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.250
a text editor,

8
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.690
The text editor is to compose and edit your code.

9
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.290
I recommend using a mid range,

10
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:26.720
no frills free editor like Sublime or Adam rather than a fully featured I d like Eclipse or

11
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.640
a bare bones editor like them.

12
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.350
With a mid range option,

13
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.380
you get a free piece of software that highlights air code,

14
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.860
lets you find files easily and doesn't do much else.

15
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.100
That's all you really need.

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.280
Access to the terminal.

17
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.470
This includes admin privileges.

18
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.730
They should go without saying I only mention it because if you're on a school or work

19
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.320
computer,

20
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.420
you may not know the administrator password,

21
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.310
and they may have locked your user out of the terminal anyway.

22
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.370
And so you might not be able to access the shell in a way that would allow you to complete

23
00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.900
this course.

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.050
You also need node version eight LTs,

25
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.930
which stands for a long term stable release.

26
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.350
Go to know J s dot org's and download and install it.

27
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.560
They have downloads for Mac PC and many Lennox distributions.

28
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.850
When you visit the home page,

29
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.580
you'll see that there are many other recent versions of note available.

30
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.640
We're choosing to teach from the LTs because that is the version that note has promised to

31
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.390
support for a given period of time.

32
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.960
If you take a look at this chart,

33
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.130
you can see that note eight is and is going to remain the stable supported version for some

34
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.080
time to come.

35
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.540
If you're watching this years in the future,

36
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.810
that might not be the case,

37
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.810
but we'll put out another version of this course when the LTs changes.

38
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.380
Though higher versions may be tempting to use,

39
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.750
like No.

40
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780
Nine might be tempting to use,

41
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.950
and it might seem stable.

42
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.930
I highly encourage you,

43
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.120
generally speaking,

44
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.380
to build your software on the LTs versions of distributions,

45
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.850
not betas or unstable or on supported releases.

46
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.330
Lastly,

47
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.550
as I mentioned in earlier lecture,

48
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.700
you might want to download the examples for these lectures so you can see all the code.

49
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.250
Right now,

50
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.840
each lecture has its own code base that you can download or calling from get hub or from

51
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.920
the course site and each lectures code base is a snapshot in time of how the code looked at

52
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.380
the end of that lecture.

53
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.210
So if you want to see exactly what the code look like after we added logging to the A p I.

54
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.210
But before we moved on to the next step,

55
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.950
for example,

56
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.050
you can go and get that exact level of code.

57
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.070
Okay,

58
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.300
so go ahead and take a moment to download text editor,

59
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.620
download no Js and install them on your machine.

60
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.670
Then you can continue on with the next section when you're done.
