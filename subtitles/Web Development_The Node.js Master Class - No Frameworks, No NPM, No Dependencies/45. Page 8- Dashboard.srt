1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
now that we have users creating checks through the G Y.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,610
We want to set up the dashboard page,

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,310
also known as the check slash all page,

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,060
so that we can list out all of their existing checks.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,530
After we do this,

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,250
we're going to allow users to edit their existing checks and delete their existing checks.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,250
But for now,

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,090
we first need to list them out so that they can click on them so we can see that check

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,690
slash all make a the dashboard page matched to handlers dot checklist.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,240
And that is a slight typo I should have said checks list.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,570
So we're going to go to the handlers file and create that hammer.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,380
Now this is the dashboard view checks.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,170
I'm going to copy this down.

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,050
Call it checks Missed.

15
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,870
Again.

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,820
The data method is get the title.

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,850
This time is just going to be dashboard and the body classes checks list.

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,680
The template it should be fetching is checks.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,150
Let's everything else can remain the same.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:23,350
Now let's create that template Touch templates slash checks list html Open it up.

21
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,150
We're gonna pay set in here.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:32,600
You can see this is pretty bare bones This is a title and a message telling them that they

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,140
can create up to five checks.

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,990
But then there is the beginnings of a table,

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,300
which list out in Table Header is the method protocol,

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,120
your L estate in details of checks.

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,160
But then we don't actually see the checks listed.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,220
That is because in the clients,

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,360
I.

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,590
J.

31
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,110
S,

32
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,690
we are going to write some JavaScript that allows us to programmatically add rose to this

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:01,860
table If the user has checks and will write that in a function that will load after the

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,300
specific page loads,

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,980
that start of function will also hide this.

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,620
Create a check blurb.

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,570
If the user already has five checks,

38
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,310
if they have no checks,

39
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,090
it will show them this blurb.

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,120
You have no checks.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,840
Please create one.

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:25,170
Let's go ahead and update that APB Js file and we can go to the checks list functions.

43
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,870
And here we see the logic that is Onley loaded on the checks list page.

44
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,810
There is a whole bunch of logic in here about pulling in the existing checks of the user

45
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:44,230
has using a get to a P I slash checks and then programmatically adding rose Tr's and sells

46
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,860
TDs to the table to list out all the checks that the user might have.

47
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,730
And here we see the logic that if they have less than five checks,

48
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,450
we can go ahead and show them he created check call to action button,

49
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,240
and if they don't have any checks,

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,500
we can show them the You don't have any checks message.

51
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,550
And he created Check Goto action.

52
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,450
Now that all that logic is in place and the CSS has been updated as well,

53
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:18,610
we can go ahead and restart the application and navigate to that page to see if our

54
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,540
currently logged in user has any checks so well,

55
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,250
we load this and there we see the check that we created earlier.

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,850
It's a put to twitter dot com with HDP its current status up,

57
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,550
and we can click here to view,

58
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,600
edit or delete it.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,810
But that won't lead to a working page yet because we haven't created the edit a check page

60
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,130
yet.

61
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,840
We can,

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,350
however,

63
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,980
create a new check which will take us back to the form,

64
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:54,450
and I'll create one for facebook dot com with some random parameters.

65
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,530
Create that check and as you can see I was now sent back to the dashboard,

66
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,850
and the check that I just created is included in this list here,

67
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,030
since it was just created and no one has checked it yet.

68
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,290
The state is currently unknown.

69
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,330
After its check.

70
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,090
The first time,

71
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,870
the state will either be up or down.

72
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,890
So this dashboard,

73
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,380
which is where you're taking to immediately upon walking in,

74
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,050
seems to be working fine.

75
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,150
If we didn't have any checks here,

76
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,960
we would see the message here saying you don't have any checks.

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,690
Please create one.

78
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,600
We can still navigate to the account settings page and all that.

79
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,240
But the dashboard is the main launching point for the real meat of the application.

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,560
So now we can move on to next lecture and finish up that last template.
