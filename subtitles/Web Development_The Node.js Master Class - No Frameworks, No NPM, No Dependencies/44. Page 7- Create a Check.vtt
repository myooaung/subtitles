00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
now that we've 100 all the housekeeping of creating an account,

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.250
logging in and out,

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.030
editing your account into leading your account,

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.550
we can actually move on to the meat of the application,

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.690
which begins with actually creating a check that we'd like to set up the created new check

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.290
page.

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.430
And we already have a server route in place for that called checks slash create,

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.860
which maps to handlers dot checks create.

9
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.560
So we're gonna take the familiar steps,

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.590
just like we did last time of copying the previous handler and then doing some slight

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.100
modifications to it to create the checks.

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.910
Create page,

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.710
say,

14
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:58.550
create a new check it's called checks Create the title is going to be creating a new check

15
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.550
.

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:07.310
We don't need a meta description because this is a protected page that you could only see

17
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.940
if you were logged in and the body class is checks create the template will be the same

18
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.350
name checks create.

19
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.840
Now we're going to create the template,

20
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.460
touch templates,

21
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.110
slash checks,

22
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.920
create dot html,

23
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.490
open it up and let's go ahead and paste.

24
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.990
In this very large template,

25
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.790
we have a header and a sub header as before we've added a new feature,

26
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.840
which is a back button which really just links back to the dashboard page,

27
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.960
which is check slash all that.

28
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.170
We have a form called checks create,

29
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.340
which allows a user to select a protocol from a drop down.

30
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.210
Tell us what the U.

31
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.390
R.

32
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.680
L is in a normal input and then check the boxes for all of the success codes that they want

33
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.570
to 100 through 500.

34
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.860
We then give them another drop down for the HDP method and one last drop down for the time

35
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.670
out seconds.

36
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.110
Lastly,

37
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.010
we have the submit button down there.

38
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.630
So since this is the first time that we are handling check boxes and select drop downs,

39
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.260
we need to update app dot Js to be able to read those type of inputs before the payload is

40
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.050
set off.

41
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.810
All right,

42
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.010
now we've done that,

43
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.960
as you can see and we've also added a success handler for checks create that redirects the

44
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.380
user to checks all after they have created a new check.

45
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.180
So if you successfully submit a new check and the foreign validates and we get a 200 back,

46
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.590
we will go ahead and redirect you to the dashboard,

47
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.660
which is just a list of all your checks,

48
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.690
including the one that you just created.

49
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.630
CSS is updated as well.

50
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.950
So now we should be able to start up.

51
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.210
The APP should be able to go over here,

52
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.530
log in with that user we've been using.

53
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:18.210
I'm going to navigate away from the check slash all page to what our new route is,

54
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:26.890
which you can see is checks slash create and you can see this new form.

55
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.110
Let's go ahead and select that.

56
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.940
We want this for twitter dot com.

57
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.350
We want thes success codes.

58
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.860
Http is put and the time out is two seconds gonna submit that.

59
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.710
As you can see,

60
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.940
we were redirected to check slash all,

61
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.050
which means we must have gotten a 200 back from the server.

62
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.650
If we navigate to our data,

63
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.530
we can see that one of these checks has actually been created by our new user,

64
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.380
the one that ends in nine.

65
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.250
These other four checks were created by the user that ends in eight,

66
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.350
which is what we did earlier.

67
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.570
But this one is new and it was just created by us when we did that example,

68
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.900
you can see that it set twitter dot com put these different success codes,

69
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.650
etcetera.

70
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.340
So created check seems to be working fine,

71
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.660
and we can go ahead and move on to the next election.
