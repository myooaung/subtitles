00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
when you started this course 80 something lectures ago,

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.890
you might have never seen the no documentation before.

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.440
But at this point,

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.830
after building a rest ful AP,

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.940
I building a Web client front end building a command line application,

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.410
adding testing and debugging to your application,

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.650
adding performance optimization to your application and then exploring the rest of the

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.450
modules available in the no documentation.

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.850
These docks should seem highly familiar to you.

10
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.100
If you started this lecture,

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.750
Siri's with imposter syndrome that should be gone.

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.880
You are one of very few DNO developers who are at least familiar,

13
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.590
if not deeply experienced.

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.510
In the full node,

15
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.250
a p I.

16
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.280
I'd encourage you to take a moment to visit the no Js documentation and read through it,

17
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.880
or at least skim it.

18
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.360
And as I mentioned,

19
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.020
you will be very familiar with each one of these sections.

20
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.690
We just pick a few at random.

21
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.420
You've already written tests using the Assertion Testing Library.

22
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.140
You've already created hashes using crypto you've already created and bound to your own

23
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.230
custom events.

24
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.330
You have used performance hooks you've created see allies using the breed line.

25
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.740
You've used timers,

26
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.330
you've used SSL.

27
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.070
You've used everything here or at least become familiar with it and why you wouldn't want

28
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.590
to use it.

29
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.980
I want to thank you for coming along with me on this journey through No Js.

30
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.380
I hope it's been a worthwhile experience for you.

31
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.910
If you have a moment to write a review and leave it on the course website,

32
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.380
that would be highly appreciated and two other points.

33
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.980
One.

34
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.850
The code base on Get Hub is open to pull requests.

35
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.050
If there's something that you think should be changed if there's a typo that you found,

36
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.390
if I misused a function or anything else that you would like to see change,

37
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.650
