00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
in this lecture,

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.950
we'd like to build out a response to the exit Command.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.270
As you can see,

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:16.070
our current responder simply says you asked for exit if we start up the app,

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.310
we can see this in effect.

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.200
If we entered the word exit,

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.990
it just tells us what we asked for.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.790
We want to modify this responder to actually kill this entire process.

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:41.140
So I'm going to get rid of this console log and change it to process Don exit and then pass

10
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.270
it.

11
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.820
Zero.

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.070
We talked about this command a moment before because it's the same that we're using down

13
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.660
here when we bind to the event that the user has tried to close to see Ally.

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.560
As I mentioned,

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.750
when we put that in,

16
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.870
we're using process,

17
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.970
which is the same global that we used to get the note.

18
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.300
Environmental variables were calling for the exit function that it has built in,

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.320
and we're passing an exit code.

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.800
Zero by convention tends to mean there was no issue.

21
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.880
Any other code will have application specific meaning.

22
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.060
But generally speaking,

23
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.330
a non zero code,

24
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.460
it's a problem or is an error.

25
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.260
Zero is fine,

26
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.650
so let's start the app back up.

27
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:28.090
Enter the exit command and you can see were returned to the command.

28
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.450
Prompt.

29
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.650
We can start the at back up again,

30
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.050
exit command again and were brought back.

31
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.430
So as you can see,

32
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.750
exit does pretty much the same thing as if we pressed control,

33
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.170
see,

34
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.850
or whatever your shortcut would be on your terminal to kill the currently running

35
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.450
application.

36
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.550
So this is a very small lecture.

37
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.730
That's all we had to do in the next lecture.

38
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.050
We can move on to filling in the response to the user,

39
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.950
asking for help.

40
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.850
So let's move on to the next lecture.
