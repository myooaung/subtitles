1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
now,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,960
the next thing we're going to want to get out of this request before we process it are the

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,110
headers that the user might have sent.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,230
So in between getting the http method and sending the response,

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,000
let's go ahead and insert what we want to do next,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,740
which is get the headers as an object.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,910
Luckily,

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,530
this,

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,340
like the previous example,

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,450
is also very simple.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,320
We want Teoh define a headers variable,

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:43,650
and its value is just going to be request R E Q wreck dot petters wreck dot headers.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,200
Now let's go ahead and log that out.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,090
I'm going to erase the rest of what we had loved previously because we already know that

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:02,750
that's working request received with these headers.

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,470
Okay,

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,210
so now we're logging out which headers we are receiving.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,600
I'm gonna go ahead and save this file,

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,850
start the act back up,

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,140
but at this point,

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,880
we need to add headers.

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,250
This request so curl were kind of outgrowing Carl at this point,

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,190
some to close that tab and switch over here to postman.

24
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:35,540
Postman is an http request library that's really useful for debugging ap eyes.

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,440
When you're building them,

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,670
it lets you form requests and the headers you want to say and at the body you want to send

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,350
really easily.

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,270
Okay,

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:50,620
so I'm going to say that we want to send a request to local host 3000 and we want to add

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,480
some headers.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,700
Food is gonna equal bar fares,

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:05,810
is gonna equal buzz and apples are going to equal oranges and red is going to equal book.

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,770
Okay,

34
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,790
so that's a whole bunch of headers sent at that request and groups we don't want to do

35
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,120
local host 30,000.

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,180
We want to do local host 3000 So I'm going to send that request.

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,060
We see that down here,

38
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,680
we can see the response that we've got back was still just raw text coming back.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,550
It's hello world,

40
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,150
but if we go back to the terminal,

41
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,550
we can see all of these headers that got sent along with the request.

42
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,180
Some of these we didn't add in Postman,

43
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,310
they were added for us.

44
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,910
But some of these we configured ourselves.

45
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,700
For example,

46
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,080
we set food tow bar.

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,000
We set red to blue apples to oranges and fizz toe bus.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,290
So now the application is understanding all the headers that it seeing as part of these

49
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:54,950
requests,

50
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,550
and it is locking them out for us.

51
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,950
I can kill this app now and move on to the next section.
