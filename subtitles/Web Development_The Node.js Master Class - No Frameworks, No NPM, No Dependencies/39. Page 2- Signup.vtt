00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
in this lecture,

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.950
we're going to be building out the logic for the account creation page,

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.160
also known as the Sign up page.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.950
So far,

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.680
the only page that we've created has been the index page,

6
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.470
the home page,

7
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.650
and that didn't need any client side JavaScript.

8
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.650
But the account creation page will because it will be a form.

9
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.070
And when a user submits the form or need to bundle up the inputs and send that to the A P I

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.200
using our APP client request function.

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.880
Now,

12
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.850
as we can see on the index page,

13
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.980
which links to the get started or sign up page,

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.650
the account creation page is located at account slash create in a previous lecture.

15
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.550
We have already set up a handler and a route for it,

16
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.200
but now we actually have to go fill out that handler.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.270
So I'm gonna open up the handlers file,

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.540
weaken just below the index handler,

19
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.670
start creating the create account peddler.

20
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.550
It's going to be handlers dot account create,

21
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:18.570
and it's going to be set up much like the index.

22
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.640
And so I'm actually just going to take all the logic that was in the index and paste it in

23
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.810
here and that will modify it for our needs.

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.390
Just like the index page will be rejecting any request that isn't a get and then we'll need

25
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.250
to prepare some data for interpellation.

26
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.890
The head title,

27
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.530
rather than being this line,

28
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:52.120
is going to be create an account and the description will be much shorter.

29
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.500
Will be sign up is easy and only takes a few seconds.

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.590
Lastly,

31
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.150
the body class is going to be account create.

32
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.590
We're going to follow the same logic to read in the template,

33
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.300
so we will be calling helpers that get template.

34
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.010
But obviously,

35
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.500
rather than calling the index template,

36
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.610
we want to call one called account,

37
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.690
create passing the template data that we defined above and then add on the universal

38
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.270
templates when we need to.

39
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.530
All this other logic is going to be the same as it was on the index page.

40
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.300
So that's all the modifications to this handler that we need to make.

41
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.470
But of course,

42
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.750
we actually need to create this template.

43
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.360
So I'm going to touch templates,

44
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.380
slash account,

45
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.160
create dot html and open up this file at the top.

46
00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:03.350
We're gonna have in H one create your account and then in H two,

47
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.300
sign up is easy and only takes a few seconds.

48
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.570
And now we are going to actually have a form that allows the user to fill out the first

49
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.780
name,

50
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.280
last name,

51
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.070
phone number,

52
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:26.130
password and a check box for terms of service agreement and then submitting before we're

53
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.050
gonna put it all inside of a dead called form rapper.

54
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.020
And now I'm not going to waste a bunch of your time writing this form from scratch.

55
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.630
As part of this video,

56
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.830
I'm just going to paste it in.

57
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.040
If you want to look at this code again,

58
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.820
you can go to our get hub where it's all there.

59
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.400
But since this isn't a front,

60
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.610
of course there's no reason toe walk through all these inputs and there you have it.

61
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.690
This is the full form.

62
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.890
It's ideas account create.

63
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.560
It's going to post to a P I slash users,

64
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.200
and we filled out a whole bunch of inputs that allow the user to know which inputs air

65
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.270
which and some scaffolding that can hold an error if we need to present an heir to the user

66
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.260
after they submit the form and all that.

67
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.680
But in order for this to work and not send a really form post to a P I slash users,

68
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.800
we're going to need to stop this form from submitting after the user clicks the submit

69
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.460
button and then bundle up the inputs ourselves and send it off to the Jase on a P I.

70
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.580
In order to do that,

71
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.180
we're going to modify app dot Js.

72
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.960
But again,

73
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.650
since this isn't a friend and lecture,

74
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.800
I'm not going to code this all up as part of this video.

75
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.520
I'm just going to paste it in from Iraq,

76
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.050
get help,

77
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.540
Okay.

78
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.990
And here it all is.

79
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.370
As you can see,

80
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.150
we have added some new logic here.

81
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.050
We've added a buying forms function which is going to stop the form from submitting and

82
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:12.540
then turn all the inputs from the form into a payload and send that payload off to the A p

83
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.760
I.

84
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.490
There's also a form response processor which has a to do in it.

85
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.390
Now that allows you to specify what should happen when a success messages received after

86
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.000
submitting specific forms.

87
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.460
So in our case,

88
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.620
this is the only form we have.

89
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.340
So we say if,

90
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.710
for my d equals account,

91
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.540
create do something in reality,

92
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.250
What we want to do after the account gets created after the sign of a successful is love

93
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.150
the user in.

94
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.150
But we'll wait to fill this out after we finished all the session logging in and longing

95
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.950
out wiring because we can just piggyback on that to fill in this section of the form.

96
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:57.330
The APP also now calls its own initialization function which gets fired after the window on

97
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.520
load event and all that does so far is called the bind forms function.

98
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:12.750
I'm going to add a temporary console log here that says the account create form waas

99
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.790
successfully submitted.

100
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.650
And now let's start the app up and look at that form.

101
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.370
Fill it out and submitted and see if we can see this console get logged.

102
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.910
So I'm gonna refresh this now we can actually go to the get started page and we can see

103
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.110
this form exists.

104
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.050
I'm gonna open up the console for after we submit it.

105
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:43.320
I'm gonna leave these inputs pretty much unchanged.

106
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.850
John Smith,

107
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:50.670
four on 51234569 which is a number we haven't used yet.

108
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:58.830
And then I'm going to say this is a password And yes,

109
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.080
I agree to the terms of service.

110
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.960
I submit the form.

111
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.710
What just happened?

112
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.030
We can see that we got the success message.

113
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.750
But if we look in the network,

114
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:16.990
we can see that there was a post to local host 3000 slash AP I slash users.

115
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.260
And if we look further,

116
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.460
we could see that we sent along a payload.

117
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.130
John Smith.

118
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.470
This phone number,

119
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.790
that password and toss agreement equals true.

120
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.250
So that payload was successfully sent.

121
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.760
We received a 200 from the A P I.

122
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.650
And if we go back to our data folder,

123
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.650
we can see that that user exists now.

124
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.750
Except,

125
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.330
of course,

126
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.470
his password is now hashed inside of our data file.

127
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.590
So the account creation form front end is working fine.

128
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.090
I'm going to get rid of this console log and before move on.

129
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:04.850
It's worth noting there was some new CSS added as part of this lecture,

130
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:10.700
but just like the JavaScript front end in app dot Js is not worth diving into because this

131
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.870
isn't a friend and course,

132
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.250
but it is available on big it up.

133
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.850
Now we can move on to the next lecture
