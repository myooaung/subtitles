1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
this course has two prerequisites.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,450
One experience with JavaScript to experience in the terminal or shell.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,380
If you've never written a line of JavaScript,

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,040
this course is definitely not for you.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,820
I will not be covering JavaScript itself,

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,910
and I'll make very few attempts to explain my usage of various functions and patterns.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,980
This course is a master class is definitely not where you want to start your journey into

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,130
JavaScript at Recommend causing these lectures,

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,460
taking an intro to Js course and then returning here later.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,600
As for a sin tax goes,

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,540
will be using whatever syntax.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,560
Best illustrates are examples.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,700
Sometimes that's es six.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,690
Sometimes it's not.

15
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,830
Sometimes there's promises.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,130
Sometimes there's callbacks.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,890
In the end,

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,340
it doesn't really matter if you don't have at least a passing familiarity with s six

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,140
conventions,

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,160
you may want to go learn that,

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,960
but I'm sure you'll still be able to understand the examples.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,090
Even if the syntax is brand new to you,

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,050
the vast majority of the code will be written in normal es five.

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,020
Now,

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,850
if you've never programmed in no Js specifically because you've only done front and

26
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,440
javascript,

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,090
for example,

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,950
that's okay.

29
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,560
This course is going to teach you everything you need to know about known.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,010
You don't need to take any other no Js course prior to this one.

31
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,480
That being said,

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,480
this is a difficult and taxing course intended to elevate your existing skills.

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,000
This probably won't be the most fun way to learn.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,450
Node,

35
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,530
for starters,

36
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,230
were just going to be too thorough.

37
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,370
We're going to teach a lots of things that note.

38
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,550
Beginners just don't need to know.

39
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,840
Also,

40
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,550
since you've never used frameworks like express or Popular in PM libraries,

41
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,750
you may very well not appreciate the whole point of this course,

42
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,850
which is to depart from those things.

43
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,880
But that's your choice.

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,260
If your front and JavaScript Dev and want to take this course as your intro to no Js,

45
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,160
you'll do fine.

46
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,590
You'll just graduate from this course at a much higher level than you might have intended.

47
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,130
Also,

48
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,090
as I mentioned,

49
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,590
you're going to need to be comfortable in the shell.

50
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,370
I'm not going to be walking through how toe change directories create an empty file,

51
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,070
move files from one location to another,

52
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,950
add things to your path or anything else like that.

53
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,490
You're expected to know your way around the terminal.

54
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,190
If you don't,

55
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,700
there are plenty of resource is out there for you to learn.

56
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,150
We don't need to cover those here.

57
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,650
That's it.

58
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,190
If you know J s are comfortable in the terminal and preferably no,

59
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,090
a little node,

60
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,710
then this course is a good match for where you're at right now.
