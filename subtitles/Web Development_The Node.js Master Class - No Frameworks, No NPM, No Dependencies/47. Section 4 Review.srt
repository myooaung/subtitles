1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
All right,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,640
We've reached the end of the front end part of this course.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,390
Hopefully for all you back end Dev's that wasn't too tedious and lengthy.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:19,290
I try to move pretty quickly through the things that I don't think would matter very much

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,750
to a no Js Dev like the CSS and much of the Front and JavaScript.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,500
Although we did a bunch of no Js work setting up the new handlers,

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,280
modifying the server to be able to serve static assets like images and CSS and JavaScript

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,370
files and fabric cons from the file system,

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,350
we actually didn't use any new modules in this section.

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:51,290
We just continue to use a lot of the modules that we were already doing things like console

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,150
things like file system.

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,860
We used FS a lot when we were reading in the content of the templates.

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,880
We use it again when we were reading in the content of static assets in order to serve them

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:05,880
.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,920
And reading in these assets meant we were in some ways using buffers.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,050
And so although we didn't need to require the buffer module,

17
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,930
we were creating and using buffers quite a bit,

18
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:25,220
and we were also using path quite a bit in order to normalize the paths to our public

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:32,240
directories in order to figure out how to read and those static assets and normalize paths

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,720
to our templates for dinner,

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,480
etcetera.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,050
And,

23
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,700
of course,

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,150
we used many Global's and some other modules that we didnt explicitly need to require in

25
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,140
the next section,

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,330
in which will be building a command line application were actually going to jump in to a

27
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:54,450
bunch of new node modules that we haven't seen yet in order to build out that command line

28
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,240
interface.

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,610
So without further do,

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,760
we can move on to the next section,

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,750
which is building a CLI.
