00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
all right.

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.220
The next thing we want to do is when her request comes in,

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.530
we want to figure out which HDP method the user is requesting.

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.910
If you think back to the requirements of this AP,

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.810
I remember,

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.200
we want to allow the requests methods of post get put and elite.

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
And we also want to allow head,

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.550
which all talk about more.

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.190
But for now,

10
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.860
we just need to figure out and log out what the actual method is.

11
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.700
So underneath,

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.640
getting the path.

13
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.940
But before we send the response or log,

14
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.050
their requests were going to get the http method.

15
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.920
All right.

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.060
Now,

17
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.150
how are we going to do that?

18
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.920
Luckily,

19
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.230
the method is one of the objects available on this request object.

20
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.580
Remember that this request object is new for every single incoming request.

21
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.500
So what we're going to do is say that far method equals wreck dot method,

22
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.020
But for us,

23
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.200
we want to be really careful with capitalization for reasons we're going to later.

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.750
And so let's just push everything down,

25
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.340
Teoh.

26
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.510
Lower case for now.

27
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.980
That's gonna be the method.

28
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.380
Teoh,

29
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.600
make sure that we're getting it.

30
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.350
Let's go ahead and modify what were logging out say that the request received on this path

31
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.900
with this method.

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.860
So now when the request comes in,

33
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.650
it'll log out both the path and the method.

34
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.520
Let's go ahead and start the application and clear out this curl terminal and send a new

35
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.950
Carl.

36
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.660
You can see that it was received with get by default.

37
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.500
This Carl application is just sending a get request.

38
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.780
And for us that get is pushed down to lower case.

39
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.300
You could just as easily push everything upto upper case to make sure that it is always

40
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.110
capitalized.

41
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.440
But whatever you do,

42
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.250
just make sure that you're consistent about it.

43
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.830
Okay,

44
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.880
So that is really simply how you get the method from an incoming http request.

45
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.550
Now we're going to move on to the next section.
