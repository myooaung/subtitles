00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Now that we have account creation,

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.050
a k a sign up working,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.390
there is a possibility that a user could be created,

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.590
and now we need to be able to sign in and out.

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.090
We also want to modify the account creation function so that after users are created,

6
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.450
their automatically signed in the first time on their behalf,

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.020
as opposed to making them create an account and then submit a sign inform.

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.610
So we want to create the session creation page,

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.020
a k a sign in or log in page,

10
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.530
and that makes a modifications to account creation in order to set up the session.

11
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.190
Creation.

12
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.390
The log in Handler.

13
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.660
We just need to reference what we called the session creation in the router in a previous

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.210
lecture.

15
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.190
So we're saying Session and slash create is going to be handlers dot session create.

16
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.740
So let's go to our handlers and below where we set up account creation.

17
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.320
Let's do session creation.

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.020
I'm gonna copy the account creation function since,

19
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.280
like the index,

20
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.970
this will be very similar.

21
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:22.020
So create new session and we should name it Handlers session create again.

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.070
It's going to reject any requests that isn't get and the head title is going to be Log in

23
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.650
to your account.

24
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:43.530
The description is going to say please enter your phone number and password to access your

25
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.150
account,

26
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.190
and the body class is going to be session create.

27
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.760
We're going to use get template is normal,

28
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.270
but obviously we want the session create template rather than account create.

29
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.270
Then we're gonna add on the universal header and footer so nothing else really needs to

30
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.860
change.

31
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.440
Now we need to actually create the session,

32
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.620
create template.

33
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.650
So I'm gonna call touch templates,

34
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.320
slash session,

35
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.200
create dot html And now we can open this and start filling it in.

36
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.130
As in the previous lecture,

37
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.690
there's no reason to go into the HTML in detail,

38
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.710
so I'm just going to paste it in here.

39
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.810
As you can see,

40
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.220
there's an H one and h to log into your account and to your phone number.

41
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.230
And then there is a form whose idea session create and posts to a P I slash tokens.

42
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.870
And in order to get this to work correctly,

43
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.400
we need to add some logic to apthe gso update this file here and now you can see there are

44
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.880
a few new things.

45
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.590
Buying forms has been improved a little bit,

46
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.550
too.

47
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.610
Have some air handling of the top and Onley try to bind forms.

48
00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.290
If there actually is a form on the page and some helper functions have been added that

49
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.150
allow you to get the current session token and then set whether or not a user is logged in

50
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.840
on the body as a class,

51
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.720
we can also set the current session token or renew the current session token.

52
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.050
And now we create a loop that will always run once a minute that will try to renew the

53
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.450
token so that a user session doesn't expire.

54
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.840
Now you can see the form response processor for the for my de account create has been

55
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.590
modified to now automatically send a request to a P I slash tokens post.

56
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.720
So,

57
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.300
in other words,

58
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.500
logged the user in after their account was successfully created,

59
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.250
so they're automatically be logged in and taken to their dashboard.

60
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.780
Similarly,

61
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.570
after a successful logging in,

62
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.390
a user is automatically redirected to their dashboard,

63
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:09.900
we can save this restart the app node index dot Js and then try to use this new log in for

64
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.550
I'm going to go back to the home page and then click on law again to be taken to form when

65
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.590
the sign in with the credentials we just created a moment ago.

66
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:29.540
So for 15 1234569 This is a password as the password and log in.

67
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.620
Now it might look like an error,

68
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.160
but this is just because we were taken to a page that doesn't exist yet.

69
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.320
We're actually on the check slash all page,

70
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.450
which is three euro off the dashboard.

71
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.910
And if we go back here,

72
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.110
we can see that there is a session token newly created,

73
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.170
which is right here.

74
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.150
And this was created when we submitted that form.

75
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.820
So the session exists.

76
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.010
It's getting stored client side,

77
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.130
and everything seems to be working fine.

78
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.370
The next thing we need to dio is give the user the possibility to log out and actually

79
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.440
destroy this session.

80
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.950
So this is what would do in the next lecture so we can move on to their now
