1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,730
In the last lecture,

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,630
we used the net module to create raw TCP client and server.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,620
In this lecture,

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,020
we are going to do the same thing.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,690
But with the TLS module,

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:23,150
which is actually just a subset of the net module that adds on SSL TLS encryption to those

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,160
existing AP eyes and so we don't need to write a whole bunch of new things from scratch

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,480
here.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,080
I'm just going to copy what we wrote from Net client and Net server to two new files and

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,990
then we can modify those files just a little bit toe add in the SSL certificates.

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,490
It's era.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:52,910
So I'm going to copy miscellaneous net server that Js and in a copy it to miscellaneous TLS

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,720
dash server dot Js Likewise,

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,950
I'm going to copy miscellaneous net client dot Js and I'm a copied over to miscellaneous

15
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,480
TLS client dot Js.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,190
Now that these to exist,

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,450
I'm gonna open up TLS server first and we can start making some modifications here.

18
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:26,610
I'm to say that this is an example TLS server listens to port 6000 and sends the word poem

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,640
to clients rather than having the dependency of net.

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,170
I'm gonna have the dependency of TLS and require TLS.

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,190
This is gonna be very similar to what we did when we're using both http and https servers.

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,550
When we created the a p I,

23
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:49,310
we did very similar things with both servers except at https added on the ability to use

24
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,150
SL's,

25
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,620
TLS and NET have the same relationship as the HTT,

26
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,810
PS and HDP modules.

27
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,090
Since we need to pull in the certificates we need to use.

28
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:09,720
These modules were familiar with FS the final system and we're gonna need path to resolve

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,360
these paths.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,470
So now,

31
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,790
before recreate the server just like we did with https,

32
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,750
we need to add some server options in our case options.

33
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,850
We're going to equal a route to the key and a route to this certificate.

34
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,010
This is just like we didn't https,

35
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,950
so I'm actually going to go back to lib slash server.

36
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,900
Look up where we got the certificates last time and we're going to use the same

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,700
certificates.

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,680
So I'm just going to pace that in here key insert.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
And since,

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,560
like last time,

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,760
we are inside of a directory inside of the root folder,

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,830
we can leave these paths untouched last time.

43
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,160
We need to leave the lib directory to get the certificates.

44
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,470
Now we need to leave the miscellaneous directory to get the certificates.

45
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,810
But the past that we right here that we resolve with the path module are the same.

46
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,970
So I'm gonna leave those options as is Now we can create the server.

47
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,810
We're gonna call of our server,

48
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,570
but instead of net create server,

49
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,700
it's TLS create server and we need to pass it.

50
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,440
These options before we expect the call back to come back and that is it.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,920
Everything else about this server can remain the same.

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,210
It has the same exact behavior as the Nets server.

53
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,050
It's just that since we in Stan,

54
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,150
she hated it with the key and certificate it's going to allow for TLS as a cell connections

55
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,150
.

56
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,740
Now,

57
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,250
I'm gonna go over to the TLS client now and modify this file.

58
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,970
One thing to note,

59
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,240
though,

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,830
is since in this example we created thes certificates.

61
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,570
Locally,

62
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,770
they're considered a self signed certificate and when you have a self signed certificate,

63
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,830
it doesn't have the authority of a normal SSL certificate that you would get.

64
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:13,080
And so because of that we need to include the certificate with our connections when we're

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,170
creating our client.

66
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,270
This is only the case with self signed certificates.

67
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,840
If you're using a real SSL,

68
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,270
you're not gonna need to do this.

69
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,710
But for us,

70
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,170
we do.

71
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,150
So I'm actually going to go back to the TLS server,

72
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:33,580
grab the same dependencies that we just did and paste them here instead of net at the top.

73
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,450
I'm going to say that this is an example.

74
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,950
TLS client connects 2.6000 sends the word Ping.

75
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,740
Now back to the server.

76
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,650
I'm gonna grab these options that we used and paste them inside the client.

77
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,300
We don't need to know the key.

78
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,250
We just need to know the certificate.

79
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,750
So within options,

80
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,570
I'm going to define the certificate,

81
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,930
but I'm going to label it s C A certificate authority and next to here,

82
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm just going to read it.

83
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,500
No,

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:12,150
this is only required because we're using a self signed certificate.

85
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,730
Now that we have the options in place,

86
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,010
we can create the client instead of calling net create connection.

87
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,410
We're gonna call TLS connect and,

88
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,870
rather than passing Port 6000 were first going to write the port.

89
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:36,510
So we're gonna call 6000 and then we're going to pass in the object full of options that we

90
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,790
defined above after that,

91
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,730
sending the message is the same client dot right and in the outbound message.

92
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,410
When the server writes back,

93
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,040
everything else is the same,

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,510
so we can leave that there.

95
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,430
Now.

96
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,990
Let's open up two tabs in the console Startup.

97
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,870
The server with node Miscellaneous T.

98
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,220
Alas,

99
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,490
staff server dot Js Now that it's listening,

100
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,950
let's start at the client and have it make that request.

101
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:21,420
So we're gonna call node Miscellaneous D a last dash client dot Js Again we see the same

102
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,850
output that we got when we created the Net client and the Nets server I roping and they

103
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,090
said Pong in the TLS server.

104
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,580
I wrote Pong and they said,

105
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:30,910
Pig.

106
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,090
So that's how you create the same thing that you would do with net.

107
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,050
But you created with TLS.

108
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,780
So now we can close this out and move on to the next lecture
