00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
in this lecture,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,770
we're going to build out the more user info command now to review the syntax of this

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,220
command.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,350
Let's look at the man page that we built.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,250
I'm gonna start the app up and call help.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:24,160
We can see that the more user info command is supposed to be specified by the admin as more

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,870
user info and then two dashes and then a user I d on the assumption that they are using

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,000
this syntax correctly.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,020
We can actually look at the text that they sent in.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,520
Split this string in half on the two dash is and then we'll know that everything to the

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,200
right of the two dashes is the user I d.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,480
So let's build out command responder.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,410
That way I'm going to scroll down to where we fill it in the placeholder.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,480
For more user info,

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,580
get rid of this console dot log.

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:02,020
Now the first thing we need to do as I mentioned is get the I.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,450
D from the string that's being provided to us in the str variable.

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,750
So the first thing we'll do is split this string into an array,

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,150
so the array equals string split,

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,900
and we want to split on Dash Dash.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:29,710
So we're going to say that user I d equals the second element in the array as long as the

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,340
second element in the array,

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,350
as long as the second element in the array is a string with a length greater than zero.

24
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:48,850
So we're going to say that our one should equal a string and are one train length.

25
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,850
It's greater than zero.

26
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,030
If so,

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,350
we will use it.

28
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,060
We'll just trim it.

29
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,450
First order for two.

30
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,950
False Now,

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,420
of course,

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,200
we only want to continue if we have a truth.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,330
E variable defined otherwise will just ignore it.

34
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,980
Now that we have a user,

35
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,460
i d.

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,930
Let's look these air up using the data library,

37
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,950
we're going to do data read,

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,680
read from the user's collection by this use radi and then we're gonna expect back an air

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,650
and user data.

40
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,750
If there isn't in there and there is user data will continue.

41
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,740
Otherwise,

42
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,000
we will do nothing to the first thing that we need to do before returning the user.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,410
Data to the console is removed the hashed password because in our scenario,

44
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,700
even the admin using the CLI tool doesn't really have a good reason for needing to see the

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,010
hash password of the user,

46
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,850
and so we're going to delete that from the user data object before locking it out.

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:10,940
Then we want to print the Jason object of that user with text highlighting by default.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,490
When you log out a Jason object,

49
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,980
it's just going to come out whatever text color your console has set,

50
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,930
and it won't be pretty printed in any way.

51
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,880
When you log out large objects,

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,870
they're very hard to grok.

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,010
And so,

54
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,100
rather than do that,

55
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,410
we want to print out a vertical space.

56
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,050
And then,

57
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,100
rather than use consul dot log,

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:43,120
we're gonna use consul dot de IR and passed that the user data object and then also passed

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:51,250
consul dot the i r a configuration object telling it colors are true.

60
00:03:51,250 --> 00:04:00,850
Then another vertical space to see how this logged out Object looks that start up the APP.

61
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,730
First,

62
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,050
we're gonna ask it to list users.

63
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,800
Now that we have a user,

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,960
I d make a phone number.

65
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,070
We can ask it a follow up question.

66
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,320
More user info,

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,250
dash dash,

68
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,900
this phone number and it just printed out this object As you can see,

69
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,670
it's not just a long Jason String.

70
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:30,820
It's actually the Js object with text highlighting now that the more user info command is

71
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,270
working,

72
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,210
we can move on to the next lecture.
