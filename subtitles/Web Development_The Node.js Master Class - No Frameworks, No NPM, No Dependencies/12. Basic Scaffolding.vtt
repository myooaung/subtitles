00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
All right,

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.210
now let's choose somewhere for our app.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.880
Toe live.

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.250
Go ahead and navigate to the parent directory you want to use and create a folder for your

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.680
app.

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.430
Name it.

7
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.520
Whatever you like.

8
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.300
I'm naming mine app.

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:28.320
If you're using get,

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.520
you might want to start by adding a get ignored to your project.

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.410
I don't need one here,

12
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.080
but if you're gonna be committing to get hub,

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.150
it might be useful.

14
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.050
If you're dis coding locally,

15
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.860
it's probably not necessary.

16
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.270
All right,

17
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.400
now in your empty directory,

18
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.470
let's to create the first file and it will be the main file for the APP.

19
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.990
Let's call it index dot Js All right,

20
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.170
now we see that we have created it here and it is just totally empty.

21
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.490
This is the file we're going to call When we invoked the application to show how this works

22
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.490
.

23
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:21.950
Let's add a console log for hello world within that file and nothing else and save it.

24
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.480
And now from with them that directory on the command line,

25
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:36.560
we're going to run node index dot Js After we do,

26
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.770
we can see that message How the world of being logged to the terminal just to review what's

27
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.410
happening and how this works.

28
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.900
Let's go ahead and show all the files in this directory.

29
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.660
You can see that there's an index dot Js file that we created a minute ago inside of this

30
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.360
directory.

31
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.870
Inside of it is a single command console dot log Hello,

32
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.360
world.

33
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:10.350
We ran the command node index dot Js that called the note application and passed it the

34
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.710
name of this script index dot Js knowed red in this file.

35
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.580
Send the commands down to V eight.

36
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.210
V eight processed it.

37
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.790
The console ended up locking out the message and then there was nothing left for nodes

38
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.960
Event loop to do,

39
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.160
so it exited.

40
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.330
All right,

41
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.600
Now,

42
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.000
go ahead and get rid of this line and we're going to start building the rial application.
