00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.750
now that our users are able to be created and then log in and out of their account.

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.800
Next page we want to build is the edit,

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.410
your account or the Account Settings Page.

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.780
We've already set this up in our server on a previous lecture,

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.690
so let's look at the router weaken.

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.910
See that account slash edit maps to handlers dot account edit.

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.270
So I'm gonna open up the handlers page,

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.650
and we can fill out this handlers dot account edit function.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.840
So I once again I'm going to copy one of the existing ones.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.110
Though it's worth mentioning,

11
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.400
we're going to be missing some of the metadata in the template data because since this is a

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.610
protected page,

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.000
there's no real reason to put a meta description in the head.

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.940
There's no way that the Google bots or any other scraper could possibly scrape that meta

15
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.530
description,

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.050
so we want to say,

17
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.880
Hit it your account and the handler again is gonna be called account at it.

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.290
In the template data.

19
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.790
We want to say that the title,

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.610
which is still visible in the tab in the browser it's going to be account settings,

21
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.100
were going to get rid of the meta description as I mentioned,

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.700
and in the body class is going to be account at it.

23
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.810
Everything else can remain the same,

24
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.850
except that get template should be getting account at it as well.

25
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.560
Let's go ahead and create that template,

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.980
so I'm gonna call touch templates account.

27
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.210
Edit html.

28
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.450
Open that up and now we can fill this out.

29
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.650
This is what this is going to look like.

30
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.040
It's going to have a title account settings,

31
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.420
horizontal rule,

32
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.320
a sub header saying Edit your account details and then two separate forms.

33
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.620
Up until now,

34
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.750
no pages had more than one form.

35
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.080
This page does,

36
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.380
and they have two different i DS,

37
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.790
but they both put to the same place they put to a P I slash users.

38
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.170
We need to make some updates to app dot Js.

39
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.660
So I've done that here.

40
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.400
That was mostly related to allowing a page to have more than one form at a time.

41
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.300
We've also added some helpers for loading data on a page when the paint is loaded.

42
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.790
Until now,

43
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.270
rendering the sign up form,

44
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.780
rendering the log in form or rendering the index haven't required any data to be pulled in

45
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.020
and shown to the user.

46
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.470
But the account settings page is different because the form that holds your first name,

47
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.400
last name and phone number shouldn't be rendered blank.

48
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.780
We need to render the form and then load it up with any of your existing settings.

49
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.480
And so we are actually have a special load account edit page that gets called by this low

50
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.150
data on Page Helper.

51
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.800
Low Data on Page gets called as part of the initialization bootstrapping.

52
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.340
Besides that,

53
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.820
most of this file is fairly unchanged again.

54
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.000
There has been some CSS added,

55
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.880
but there's no reason to jump into that.

56
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.820
Okay,

57
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.090
let's start this app again.

58
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.410
Note index dot Js Now let's go back to our lab log in one more time.

59
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.190
I'm just gonna move this console out of the way.

60
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:45.930
Now we're at the check slash All page with still doesn't exist.

61
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.510
So we actually need to go back to the home page and then click on account set.

62
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.870
ICS now were taken to the account settings page.

63
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.420
You can see that the phone number is filled in,

64
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.580
but that is an immutable field.

65
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.450
First name and last name are both available to change and password can be changed.

66
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.380
So I'm gonna change my name from John to Johnny Smith,

67
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.250
Smithy,

68
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.810
and save those changes,

69
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.820
we can see the changes have been saved.

70
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.340
If we refresh this page,

71
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.600
they persist.

72
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.600
And I'm going to change my password to just the word password,

73
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.930
which,

74
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.470
of course,

75
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.560
you should never do.

76
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.810
But for this example,

77
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.150
I am,

78
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
And that has been saved as well.

79
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:38.020
All this kind of error handling and success messaging is now built in to the app dot Js and

80
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.650
it's styled by the CSS.

81
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.110
If we refresh the account settings,

82
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.240
page that message and goes away,

83
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.860
I can log out and log in again with the new password,

84
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.530
which is dressed password,

85
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.250
and I back in at the check slash all Pidge.

86
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.750
So everything seems to be working fine.

87
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.050
We can kill this server and move on to the next lecture.
