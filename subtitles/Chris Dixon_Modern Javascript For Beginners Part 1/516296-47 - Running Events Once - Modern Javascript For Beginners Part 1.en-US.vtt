00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.290
Welcome back. We're now going to take

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.460
a look at how we can run

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.265
a event only a single time.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:09.990
We'll jump into the current file

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.790
which is Running Events Once,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.100
and open this up inside the browser.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.100
This also has an attached events.js

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.020
file with the similar example

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.510
to what we looked at in the previous videos.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.570
We know from the star buttons at the top,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.670
we're going to loop through all of these,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.820
the forEach loop at the EventListener which will list now

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.465
for a click and then run our addToFavorite function.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.070
All it does is to create a simple alert with the text,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.825
which is either the ultimate vegan

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:41.135
or the spicy bean burger.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:42.770
A little earlier when we looked at

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.900
different ways to listen for events.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.700
I mentioned that there is a little more to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.790
addEventListener than what we're currently using it for.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.459
We just looked at one of the features previously,

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:54.680
which was to add an options object and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.350
set the capture phase to be equal to true.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.680
Along with this, another option we

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.495
have is to restrict the event,

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.745
the only ever be called once.

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:07.060
This is pretty simple, all we need to do is to change

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.665
this to be once and set this to true.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:13.060
Let's see what effect this has inside the browser.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, if we reload and click on one of the stars,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.855
we see the title of ultimate vegan.

00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:21.880
This all works completely fine but what

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.340
about if you try to click this a second time?

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.030
The second time round we don't

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.890
see the text of ultimate vegan,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.195
instead, we see the text of recipe clicked.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:33.980
This makes sense because we've set the event listener for

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.785
the title to only ever run once.

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:38.450
Therefore, it will refer back to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.310
the surrounding article since

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.120
the stars event is no longer active.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.140
This is a really great way to add

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.620
a single use event listener to only ever be called once.
