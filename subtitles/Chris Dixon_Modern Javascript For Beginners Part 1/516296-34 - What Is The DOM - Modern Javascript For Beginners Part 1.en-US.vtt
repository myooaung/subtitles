00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.950
Just before we jump into some code,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.160
it's really important to know about something which we're

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.825
going to look at in this section called the DOM.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.370
The DOM stands for,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.290
Document Object Model and it's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.590
a programming interface for our HTML pages.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.780
This may sound complex but it's not too

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.270
confusing once know know the basics.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.925
Taking a very basic and script buck version

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.140
of a web document,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.720
this is the basic element we have.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.380
All documents need to have this HTML wrapper and then

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.175
we have the head and body section one level inside.

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:38.260
To visualize how this would look in the DOM tree,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.620
this example would be something like this.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.255
Over on the right, the document is the top of the tree.

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:48.075
This is our web document or our web page.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:51.690
Then below it, we have the root HTML wrapper.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600
Below this, we have the head and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.360
the body sections which are both alongside each other.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.680
This is actually how we see when we see

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.665
them in our text editor.

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:02.090
Our DOM is constructed of all of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.095
these objects which mirror our HTML page.

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:07.070
One step further, add in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.050
a title element to the head section which

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.925
we always do and also a h1 element to the body.

00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:16.235
These all nested are structured exactly the same as

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.850
our web page as we see inside of our text editor.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.510
All of these objects in the DOM are clusters nodes.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.115
The h1 for example,

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:26.960
is an element node,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.565
an envelope of the heading,

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:29.855
and also the title.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.415
We have a text node,

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:34.435
which is the text content of each element.

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:36.830
Basically, the text which goes between

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.400
the opening and the closing tags.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.125
Elements can also have attributes too,

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:43.745
such as an h-graph,

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:45.725
a class, and an ID.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:47.465
These are also nodes too.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:49.730
These ones are called attribute nodes,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.105
just like we see here down at the bottom.

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:53.630
We have element nodes,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.995
we have text nodes,

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:57.505
and we also have attribute nodes too.

00:01:57.505 --> 00:01:59.000
We've came this file without

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.140
knowing anything about the DOM.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.345
This is all happening in the background.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:04.310
Why should we even care?

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.220
Well, the DOM provides a way for JavaScript

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.140
or other languages to connect to our HTML.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.650
It gives us access to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.270
the document tree so we can

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.385
make changes to it if we want to.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:18.290
This means we can use JavaScript to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.940
create new HTML elements.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.215
We can remove them,

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:23.045
we can change styling,

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:25.850
we can add or remove attributes and basically

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.150
do anything we want with our HTML elements.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.580
Although we write in JavaScript code,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.080
it uses the DOM to access these HTML elements.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.850
They work together to allow us to do this.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.820
We've already briefly looked at working with the DOM in

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.800
our earlier videos when we looked at

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.030
some examples such as

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.255
changing the text inside the browser.

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:49.430
We'll have a lot more to cover in this section too.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.950
Let's take a look at some code in the next video.
