00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.610
This video carries on from the last video,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.250
which is adding elements to the page.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.435
Previously, we replicated this section just here,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.190
using JavaScript by creating

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.560
all of the elements one by one.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.835
We then added these elements to the various containers,

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:23.205
and when we left off with this full section reference,

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:26.730
your reference list was the section wrapper.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.220
This is stored inside of a variable,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.530
and we can see this if we type this inside

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.335
the console. Open this up.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.540
We already have this added to the page we see,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.895
but this is inside of our HTML.

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:41.010
What we're going to do, so we don't get confused,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.130
is to comment out this section,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.190
refresh and now we're going to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.325
dynamically insert this using JavaScript.

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:51.095
Let's take a think about what we

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.960
actually want to do here,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.280
we have this body section about the top,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.980
and the section just here which you

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.260
created is a direct child of this body,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.035
as is the header and the image elements.

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:05.000
What we need to do is to first

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.210
begin by selecting the body,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.230
roll it down to our script, and

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.910
we can access this with document.body.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.235
Two common methods which you have available to use

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.069
is append and also prepend.

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.815
Prepend will add the new content at the beginning,

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.695
and append will add it to the very end.

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:28.030
Let's begin by taking a look at prepend.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.335
This is a method, so we open up the parentheses,

00:01:31.335 --> 00:01:34.380
now we want to add our section wrapper.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.890
Let's say this and refresh the browser,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.205
and this is added to the very beginning

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:42.215
of the body section.

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.750
We can also change this to be append and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.130
this new section will be

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.865
directly added to the end of the body.

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:51.035
Something else we can also do with append,

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:53.930
rather than adding a single element like this,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.325
is to add multiple elements to our page,

00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:00.290
and we can also add different types of content too.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.940
For example, we can add

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.205
a JavaScript like string of texts,

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.440
which is called a DOMString.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.155
Let's say any text inside here,

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:10.620
and then separate it by a comma,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.235
we can add multiple pieces of information,

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:17.080
such as multiple pieces of text or multiple elements,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.440
so let's also say we wanted to add an element,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.320
let's go for our button, also our imageElement.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.180
We can add in as many of these as we would like to.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.690
Now, save and refresh this.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.030
We can see our text,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.185
we can see our button,

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:40.010
our image, and the final DOMString at the very end.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.825
Similar to this, we also have

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:44.350
a method called appendChild.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.440
Let's give this a try. Now,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.670
if we save and then refresh this,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.625
we'll see an error straight away inside the console.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.350
We see this error because there is

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.730
some differences between how

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.325
append and appendChild handles

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:01.240
inserting elements or nodes.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.920
AppendChild can only be used at

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.195
a single node or a single text element.

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:09.085
If I have more than one to add,

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:11.570
the append method is the way to go.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.190
Also, as you see here,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.220
appendChild can not be used with DOMStrings,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.840
so we can not use it to insert

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.395
text nodes just like we did before.

00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:23.330
Also only the appendChild method

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.370
gives us back a return value,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.130
and this return value is a newly added node.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.130
With this in mind,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.080
back to our area which we were at before.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.600
The reason we have this area is for two reasons,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.225
it's because we're trying to add some DOMStrings,

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:39.620
and also the number of

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.650
elements which we are trying to add.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.795
If we reduce this down to one single element,

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:46.760
let's go for the buttonElement,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.270
we shouldn't now see a problem.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.835
The next method to cover is insert before.

00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:54.560
Insert before gives us a bit

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.175
more flexibility in where we want to place our new node,

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:01.940
fill up and let's take our header for example.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.980
For this, imagine we wanted to

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.810
place a new piece of content,

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.590
which is a new element between the heading and the nav,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.140
so on this line just here,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.960
the methods we've covered so far only place

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.040
elements at the beginning or at the end.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.955
As the insert before method sounds,

00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:22.305
it can be used to insert

00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:24.855
our new element before this nav,

00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:28.030
let's remove this first and then go down to our script.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.335
We first need to select the parent.

00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:34.005
In our case, the parent is the header,

00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:39.800
so document.querySelector, drop the header,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.750
and install this inside of a variable,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.920
and also since we want to

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.570
insert this element before the nav,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.215
we also need a reference to this too,

00:04:50.215 --> 00:04:54.520
so it is inside of a variable called nav.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.480
Set this equal to document.querySelector,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.180
and this time we'll select our nav.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.170
Now we have access to two elements,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.920
first of all, the header is the parent element,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.650
and the nav is the element where we want to insert

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.770
a new node just before, and for this,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.420
we select the parent which is

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.420
the header, the method name,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.435
which is insert before,

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:21.260
and then inside the brackets we need

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.045
to pass in it two things.

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:26.390
First, it's the element which you want to insert,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.950
and we're going to reuse any of

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.615
these elements from above.

00:05:29.615 --> 00:05:32.135
Let's go for the button elements,

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:35.435
and as the method name of insert before suggests,

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.830
we then need to add the name of

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.045
the element where we want to insert this button before,

00:05:40.045 --> 00:05:43.255
and in our case it's the navigation element.

00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:46.860
Let's try this out, refresh the browser.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.115
Now our button has been inserted before this navigation.

00:05:51.115 --> 00:05:54.170
This works by selecting a parent which is the header,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.855
and then adding a element inside.

00:05:56.855 --> 00:05:58.850
Another method which also works on

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.150
the parent, is replaceChild.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.720
As it sounds, it will replace

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.040
one of the elements inside of

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.010
the parent with a new one which we specify.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.990
Now let's comment this out, and we can also

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.880
use the header as our parent once more.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.645
The method name, which is replaceChild.

00:06:15.645 --> 00:06:18.450
ReplaceChild also takes in two values,

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.635
the first one is the new elements which we want add in.

00:06:21.635 --> 00:06:24.730
Again, let's go for the button as an example.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.465
Then the second value is the old element,

00:06:27.465 --> 00:06:28.920
which we want to replace.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.985
I'll use the nav for this example, refresh.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:34.115
Now the navigation has been removed

00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:37.030
and replaced with this new buttonElement.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.040
These are some different ways of adding new nodes or

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.650
elements to a web page using JavaScript,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.940
and to around this off,

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.125
I'm going to remove the sections here.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.750
Comment out this example,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.400
and we're going to append

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.675
the sectionWrapper back to the page,

00:06:52.675 --> 00:06:53.990
which was a new section which we

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.035
created in the last video.

00:06:56.035 --> 00:06:57.955
Good. This is now on the page,

00:06:57.955 --> 00:06:59.540
and in the upcoming video,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.000
we're going to discover how we can clone elements

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.650
and also how to remove them.
