00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.540
Understanding the theory side of

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.565
JavaScript is really important,

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:10.530
and we'll get to this very soon,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.300
but there is nothing like seeing

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.775
exactly what it can do right in front of you.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:17.550
To see some of the things JavaScript can do,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.530
we're going to open up a web page.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.485
Here, I'm on the Mozilla Developer Network.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:25.620
This is developer.mozilla.org.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.320
This will also work on any other web page,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.930
so you can choose a different one if you would like to.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.720
I'm not going to show you how JavaScript can be used to

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.095
control or make changes to any website.

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:39.110
Now, just a quick word before we

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.900
get any further in this video.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.530
There may be one or two things

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.725
which look complex or unfamiliar,

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:47.600
so if you're not used to coding or JavaScript,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.520
some of this may look a little bit intimidating,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.810
but just be aware,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.370
this is just to give you some guides

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.860
on what JavaScript can do.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.420
We don't expect you to remember any of this,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.190
and we will cover everything we've been

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.515
through as you progress through the course.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:02.840
Think of this as a little taster to get you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.815
excited with what JavaScript can do to a web page.

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.200
To see what JavaScript can do,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.310
I'm going to open up

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.605
the developer tools inside of Google Chrome,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.390
which is right-click, and then go down to Inspect.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.230
Let's just make this a little bit

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.775
bigger so it's more visible.

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:21.470
If you are using a different browser,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.040
such as Safari or Firefox or Edge,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.670
most of the developer tools are very similar,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.820
so you should be fine if you want to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.980
use a different browser too.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.195
But if you want things exactly the same,

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:34.600
I would follow along with Google Chrome.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.100
First thing we see here is this Elements tab,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.020
which has access to all of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.995
the HTML structure which makes up this web page.

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:44.600
We can either hover over any of these lines of code,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.610
and it will highlight over on the left

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.990
which section we are currently working on,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080
or we could also click on this arrow,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.384
which is the inspector,

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:53.750
and select any one of

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.060
these sections or elements on the page.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.680
For example, let's go for

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.065
this level 1 heading and click on this.

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:01.490
This will instantly highlight

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.520
this level 1 heading inside the code,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.610
and when it's selected,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.230
you will notice over on the right you have

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.145
this equals $0,

00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:12.000
and then we see this pop-up just below which says use

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.175
$0 inside the console to refer to these elements.

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:19.250
We can use $0 inside of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.020
this Console tab to select

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.985
any one of our elements or sections,

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:26.020
and then we can apply some JavaScript as well.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.910
Let's just confirm we have the right elements

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.155
selected with $0,

00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:33.085
and then we get back our level 1 heading.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.060
We have selected this element,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.710
but what can we do with it?

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.270
Well, the list is huge,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.345
and we're only going to scratch the surface here,

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:43.130
and we'll cover a lot more during this course.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.620
If we again select $0

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.480
to point to our level 1 heading, and then a dot,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.720
we can see below we have access to lots of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.185
different options which we can use on this element.

00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:57.305
A common one, which we will use plenty in this course,

00:02:57.305 --> 00:02:59.825
is something called inner text.

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.690
Inner text is a way to simply change

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.745
the contents in between the opening and the closing tag.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:10.715
It will have this text of resources for developers.

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:12.980
If we want to, we can set this equal to

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.625
any new string of text.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:17.610
Open up the quotations.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.050
We can use single quotations or double,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.190
even one is fine,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.910
and then we can set this text to be

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.160
anything else which you want to.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.215
Let's go for, I have changed,

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:30.920
and then immediately we get back

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.930
the newly returned text in the console,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.610
and we can also see the web page has updated too.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.435
Before we go any further,

00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:40.340
don't worry about doing any of these changes.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.400
This is not updating the live website.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.935
This is only inside of our own browser.

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:48.320
All we need to do is to simply refresh

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.700
the browser and this will be

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.325
reinstated back to the original version.

00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:53.915
Also, we're doing this,

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:56.930
we now reset our $0,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.725
and this will now return undefined.

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:01.460
We will look at undefined in

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.260
more detail throughout this course.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.570
But for now, we can think of it as simply

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.340
no element has been assigned to this $0.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.820
Just like before, we need to go back

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.515
into the Elements tab to select

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:13.790
any one of these sections or

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.180
elements which you want to work with.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.830
Let's go for one of these links up at the top.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.200
Again, use the arrow, and we can hover over any one

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.660
of these buttons. Click on this.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.705
We have this button with the ID of Feedback button,

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:30.455
which should now be assigned to $0.

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:32.675
Let's select this, and we see

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:35.300
our button is now returned.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.500
Again, $0 and then the dot will give us

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.760
access to a range of

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.910
features which we can apply to this element.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.355
One of those is the style property,

00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:49.415
and from here we can also add

00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:51.650
an additional style property which

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.385
we want to apply to this particular button.

00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:57.080
Just like with regular CSS,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.075
if you've used CSS in the past,

00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:01.460
all of the same style properties

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.270
are available to use inside the console.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.295
An example for this could be the text color,

00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:10.400
which we can set to any value which is

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.640
a valid CSS color. Hit ''Enter''.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.290
Nevertheless, immediately update inside the browser.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.095
Press up, and we can also add a second property.

00:05:22.095 --> 00:05:25.090
Let's go for the font family.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.350
Again, we can change this inside

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.695
the quotes to be a different font family of cursive.

00:05:32.695 --> 00:05:36.305
As expected, this will automatically update the browser.

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:40.400
Just one thing to note when working with styles is,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.420
here we see we have the color property set to hot pink,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.530
and this works just like a regular style sheet.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.210
However though, when we have two words such as

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.240
font and family, in regular CSS,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.445
we would keep this all lowercase

00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:57.700
and separate this with a hyphen,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.180
so we'll write it like this as

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.205
two words with the dash inside.

00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:03.139
But instead, when using JavaScript,

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.075
if we have two or more words,

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:08.390
we need to change this into what is called camelCase,

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.310
and each word after the first one

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.220
begins with a capital letter.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.670
That's pretty much the only thing

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.900
you need to remember at this stage.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.095
We have access to all of the same CSS properties,

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.520
but we need to type these out as

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.835
camelCase when using JavaScript.

00:06:21.835 --> 00:06:25.085
Another thing we're going to now look at is events.

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.380
Again, we have a dedicated events section

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.420
later on in the course.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.975
But for now, I just want to

00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:31.580
get you a little bit excited about what

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.110
JavaScript can do when interacting with the user.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.650
To see an example of this,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.980
we can ask the browser to listen out for a mouse event

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.850
such as when a mouse hovers over this particular element.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.605
We can again do this by selecting our button with $0,

00:06:48.605 --> 00:06:53.365
and then we can use an event called onmouseover.

00:06:53.365 --> 00:06:55.640
This will detect when the mouse

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.605
hovers over this particular element.

00:06:57.605 --> 00:07:01.700
Then we're go to trigger what is called a function.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.040
A function is like a task which is going to

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.495
run when the mouse hovers over this particular button.

00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:10.235
Don't worry if this looks unfamiliar,

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:12.785
we have a lot more detail on functions coming up.

00:07:12.785 --> 00:07:14.705
But for now, all we're going to do

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:17.510
is to select this particular element.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.365
Again, access the style property,

00:07:20.365 --> 00:07:23.390
and this time let's go for the background

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.240
to be equal to any color, such as orange.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.270
Hit ''Enter'', and this mouseover event

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.860
will now be activated.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.790
If we now put the mouse over this particular elements,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.900
the background is now changed to be orange.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.255
This is a way to quickly test things out in the browser.

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.755
But when it comes to writing

00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:45.955
real JavaScript code inside of our text editor,

00:07:45.955 --> 00:07:48.375
$0 won't work,

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:52.530
$0 only works inside the browser's developer tools.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.160
Instead, we need a way to access any of

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.805
these elements from the page from the outside.

00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.030
For example, back over to the element's page,

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.400
and what we're going to do is to

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.440
select a different section.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.480
Let's go for the main,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.900
which has the ID of content.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.915
Of course, we could access

00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:12.370
$0 since we are in the developer tools,

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.360
but we need to get used to accessing

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.330
these elements from a text editor.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.520
The way we do this is by starting

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.365
from the very top level,

00:08:21.365 --> 00:08:24.275
and this is by accessing the documents.

00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:25.940
We can see straight away that

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.325
the full page will be highlighted.

00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:32.215
This is because the document is this actual web page.

00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:35.960
Then once we've selected the full page just like this,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.210
we need a way to filter this page down

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.580
to the particular element which we want.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.100
JavaScript provides us with certain methods

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.940
which we can use to filter down this page.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.990
As we can see here with this auto complete,

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.480
we can select an element by the ID,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.130
by the class name,

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.720
and also by the element's name

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.990
too, but more than these later.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.815
I'm going to go for getElementById,

00:08:58.815 --> 00:09:01.340
and then inside of the brackets we can pass in

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.375
the ID of the element which we want to select.

00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:06.455
Looking at the Elements tab,

00:09:06.455 --> 00:09:09.350
we see this main section has the ID equal

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.760
to content as a string.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.470
Pass this in, and also note here

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.200
that this is also camelCase too.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.315
Just like the font family above,

00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:22.340
each and every word after the first

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.770
one begins with a capital letter.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.160
Hit ''Enter''.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.575
This then returns back our main with the ID of content.

00:09:29.575 --> 00:09:33.155
We are in the exact same position as when we use $0.

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:36.095
If we press up, we get the same line of code.

00:09:36.095 --> 00:09:38.285
We can then use dot to access any

00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:41.185
of the same features which we used before.

00:09:41.185 --> 00:09:43.710
For example, set the style,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:50.055
and then let's go for the CSS opacity equal to 0.3.

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:52.040
This isn't applied, we can still

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.900
do any other thing which we had before,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.490
such as the background.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.640
This equal to anything. Let's go for red.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.850
There we go.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.560
The background for the main section

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.705
has now been transformed to red.

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:08.560
Let's just refresh and reinstate

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.850
this back to its original state.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.510
JavaScript is not limited to

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.825
only changing the elements in our page.

00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:18.050
We can also use it to do so much more.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.140
We have access to date features,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.730
we can access timers,

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.425
and also some math functionality too.

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:26.590
Let's, for example, add up two numbers.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.460
We'll say 5 plus 11 is 16,

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.910
7 takeaway 2 is 5.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.670
We have loads of other math features too,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.030
so we can select the math object

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.370
and then dot, and then scroll through.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.280
We can see we have lots of different options,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.750
but a popular one is Math.random.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.450
Add the brackets just afterwards and hit ''Enter'',

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.505
and this will generate a random number

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:54.385
between zero and one.

00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:55.650
If we keep trying this,

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.140
we get a different value each time.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.950
This is just a little taste of what JavaScript can

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.855
do and how we can use it to interact with a web page.

00:11:04.855 --> 00:11:06.790
There is so much more to learn,

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.060
and we'll find out more of

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.430
these features as we progress through this course.
