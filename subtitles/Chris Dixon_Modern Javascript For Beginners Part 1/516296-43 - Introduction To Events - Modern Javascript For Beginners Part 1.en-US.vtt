00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.080
The upcoming videos are going to be focused on events.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.164
These are a really useful part of JavaScript.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:12.030
Events are like things which happen in the browser,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.860
such as a button click,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.780
a mouse passing over an image,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.775
a keyboard button was pressed.

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:19.800
When any of these events happen,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.425
it send a signal for us to do something.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.530
Often, well it's now for these events to happen

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.980
and then run some code such as a function.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.070
For example, you will probably have

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.990
filled out a form on a web page,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.405
such as a contact form,

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:36.085
and then hit Submit.

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:38.525
Well, when that form is submitted,

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:41.335
it also finds a submit event.

00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:44.540
We could attach a click event to an element such as

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.220
a button and this could run

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.075
a function each time this button is clicked.

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:51.575
Also, if you have ever visited

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:53.990
a webpage and then tried to leave,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.100
by moving the mouse up to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.425
the Close Browser button at the top,

00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:00.850
I want to then see a promotion of a pop-up on the screen.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.240
Well, this is all JavaScript Events

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.250
happening in the background.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.990
We could attach a mouseover event to an image which

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.190
maybe reveals more of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.130
the image as the pointer moves over it.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.700
As you can imagine, the possibilities are huge.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.100
Remember, JavaScript interacts with

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.140
our HTML through the DOM.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.270
Again, we're mixing a JavaScript

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.150
here with our HTML elements.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.460
With this in mind, we need to make use

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.015
of the DOMs event interface.

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:34.430
Most HTML elements can accept an event listener

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.895
being attached and there's multiple ways we can do this.

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:41.940
We will discover some of these in the upcoming video.
