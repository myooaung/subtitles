00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.585
The game is not functional in terms of the drag-and-drop.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:07.920
But to make it even better,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.840
we could keep track of the score and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.465
also reset the game at the end too.

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:14.890
First, let's begin by tackling the score.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.230
At the top of the script,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.105
we need a variable to store this,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:19.890
so I'll jump to the very top

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.930
and we'll create a variable using

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.385
that and we'll initialize a score with a value of zero.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:30.090
Inside of our index, jump into this page,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.470
we already have a score section over the top.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.430
We've got the score text inside the level three heading.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.200
Now we have a span with the ID of score,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.580
which we are going to update inside of our script and

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.400
a place to obtain the score is going to be

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.770
inside of a handle drop section.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.740
Jump inside here. This is going to be where we check if

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.090
the correct shape has been

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.705
dropped inside of the if statement.

00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:56.120
If this is true, just above our return statement will

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.560
access our score variable

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.915
and increase this by the value of one.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:02.060
We then need to update our span section,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.950
so appears inside the browser.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.470
We can do this by grabbing

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.180
document.querySelector as an ID of score.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.340
But I want to set the inner text

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.320
to equal to our score variable.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.600
We can copy these two lines,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.930
well function and then we

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.490
could do the opposite just below.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.140
If we remove the console log of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.440
incorrect and places outside the if statement,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.730
the only difference is we're going to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.995
deduct one from the score.

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:39.740
Let's try this, refresh the browser,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.900
and if you try one of the correct shapes,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.685
this increases the score.

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:46.405
Let's try a second number 2.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:49.560
This is all good and if we try an incorrect shape,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.080
drop this in the score is

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.020
deducted by the value of one each time.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.880
Also, if we refresh the browser

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.470
as soon as we begin the game,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.700
we also want to make sure that the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.910
current score is set to be zero.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.140
Since we already have our score to be

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.010
initialized as the value of zero.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.480
We can also copy this update and we can set

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.795
this just above our function, so refresh.

00:02:12.795 --> 00:02:14.970
This begins with the value zero.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.475
Try to drag a shape in,

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:19.145
and this is still updated correctly.

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:22.010
The next thing is this Play Button up at the very top.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.450
We only want to make sure that this is

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.860
visible once the game has ended.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.905
Currently, if we refresh the page,

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.560
we don't want to see the Play Again button because we

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.790
can already start the game by

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.730
dragging any of these shapes.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.980
We'll do outside of our functions at the top

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.250
of the page is we'll begin by grabbing our button.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.285
Document.querySelector passing in a button.

00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:50.140
This is the element we used for the section just here

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.950
and then we'll store this inside of a constant.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.640
Let's call this StartGameBtn.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.215
Initially, we need to access

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.030
our start game button and set

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.655
the display type to be equal to none.

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:12.810
The style property of display equal to none.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.120
This will hide all button at the very start of the game.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.760
Then we're going to create two new functions.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.290
One function is going to handle

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.730
what to do with the start of the game,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.055
and then a function to handle the end of the game.

00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:30.885
Function and game as you set these up for now.

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:33.200
Then a second function just below,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.640
which is for start game.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.040
Start with the end game function and open up

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.770
the curly braces and at the end of the game,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.300
we want to re-introduce

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.260
button so the user can restart the game.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.275
All we need to do is to copy this line here

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:53.630
where we set the display type and we'll replace

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.545
this by changing this to be in line.

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.600
Then inside of the start game function,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.825
we need to reset everything back to its original state.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.445
This includes the score.

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:06.665
This includes removing the Play Again button

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:09.485
and also moving these shapes back into position.

00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:12.450
We could do all this manually if you wanted to,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.630
or it will be a lot simpler if

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.375
we refresh the page to give it the same effect.

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:21.230
To do this, we need to access the Window Object,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.405
then select the current location,

00:04:23.405 --> 00:04:26.170
and then a method called reload.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.280
Now we've got our two functions,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.750
and actually we need to do is to actually

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.520
call them at the right times.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.395
The start game is pretty simple,

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:35.740
we just call it when the Play Again button is clicked.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.180
I have reference this inside of

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.090
start game button to access this,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.895
and then we'll listen for a click by attend

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:47.795
an event listener as in a click.

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:49.370
Then we'll run our function,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.630
which is start game.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.170
The end game is a little bit more tricky.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.770
If we go over to the index.html

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.270
and into the drag-section.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.060
Each time we successfully drag

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.590
one of these into the same shape,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.375
such as this one just here.

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.680
The div in the bottom section will then disappear.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.350
One by one, we're moving each one of these shapes.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.960
The game is basically over when the wrapper,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.930
which is the drag-section has

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.250
no more child elements left.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.300
The drag we'll first begin by

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.030
accessing our drag-section of the script.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.420
We'll do this inside of a handle drop. It has things out.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.285
We'll begin inside of a console log where we'll select

00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:37.860
our wrapper so document.querySelector.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.670
This has the class of drag-section and then

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.170
our elements have access to

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.559
a property by the number of child elements it contains,

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.050
which is called childElementCount.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.295
At the end.childElementCount.

00:05:55.295 --> 00:05:56.870
I'll just make this a little bit

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.565
bigger so it's more visible.

00:05:58.565 --> 00:06:01.745
Let's save this and test this out inside the browser.

00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:04.500
Open up the Developer Tools,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.750
jump into the console.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.240
Let's try this out, our console log is

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.490
run at the start of the drop function.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.130
As soon as we drop any one of these shapes into place,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.360
if you then run the function and give us the value of 10.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.560
Our second one should be nine and

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.170
the value is always one higher

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.435
than the amount we see on the screen.

00:06:26.435 --> 00:06:28.430
Currently, we have the value of nine,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.010
we see eight elements on the screen.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.480
The reason why is because we're

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.830
doing a console log of the top of

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.520
the function before we actually remove this element.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.260
Effectively, the game is over

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.350
when the current value is one.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.340
Instead of the console log,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.620
we can remove this and turn this into

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.930
an if statement at the very end

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.150
open up the curly braces and we'll

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.405
check if this value is equal to one.

00:06:53.405 --> 00:06:57.490
If it is, we'll then call our end game function.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.380
Let's try this out, what we now want to do is to

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.340
make sure that we get to the end of the game.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.895
Once we drop the last shape into place,

00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:06.950
we should now run the end game function,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.730
which will link it with access to the Play Again button.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.270
So refresh, and I'll go through

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.085
each one of these one by one,

00:07:13.085 --> 00:07:16.620
making sure that all of these are correct.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.450
That's one, and if we dropped the last one into place,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.450
we now see the Play Again button has appeared at the top.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.550
We also could remove this border down at the bottom,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.915
but this is okay for now.

00:07:32.915 --> 00:07:35.720
We can just take this is working, the play again.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.060
The Play Again function will now reload

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.530
our page and reinstate

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.005
everything back to the original state.

00:07:42.005 --> 00:07:44.900
If you want to do if the border down at the very bottom,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.065
we can do is also in the end game function,

00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:52.465
we can grab the drag-section with document.querySelector.

00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:54.200
Since this is a class,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.260
we use dot and grab the drag-section.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.650
But the style, the border

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.520
to be equal to the value of none.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.700
Let's try this one more time,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.900
access the start of the game.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.160
Complete this game by dragging

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.570
all the shapes up to the top.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.080
Plus one, there we go.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.900
Our game now ended in the board has

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.030
now been removed from the bottom of the page.
