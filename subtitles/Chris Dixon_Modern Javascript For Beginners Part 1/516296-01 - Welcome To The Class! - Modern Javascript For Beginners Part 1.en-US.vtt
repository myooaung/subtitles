00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.845
Hey. Welcome to this class.

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:09.300
As we all know, learning

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.520
any new skill can be challenging,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.890
and JavaScript is no exception.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.410
JavaScript has such a wide range of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.870
features and things that can be useful,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.850
and this can often leave beginners in

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.615
a difficult situation wondering where to even begin.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.945
This is why I've created this class.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.525
Working it from the very beginning,

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:32.445
I will show you what JavaScript is,

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:35.835
what it can do, and why we even use it at all.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.460
This class covers everything you need to know to become

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.335
a competent JavaScript developer.

00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:44.050
If you've not taken one of my classes before,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.920
my name is Chris, and I've been building

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.960
websites for over 20 years,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.580
and I've also been teaching

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.815
these skills for over seven years,

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.470
both video classes alongside

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.145
leading web development bootcamps too.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:59.635
This is Part 1 of 2,

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:01.520
and it will give you a great foundation in

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.120
JavaScript of all of the basics including arrays,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.585
functions, objects, events and the DOM,

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.090
web APIs, and all the details

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.115
which you need to know in-between.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.900
All these topics are covered in

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.910
a clear and structured way,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.225
all while building a practical projects as we go,

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:23.360
including real-world example use cases,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.495
and also some mini challenges too.

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:28.010
At the end, we also put all of these skills

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.040
together by building a work-in video player,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.650
including fully custom controls,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.395
but also a fun shape drop game too,

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.900
using the drag-and-drop API.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.255
It includes a project folder which we'll

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:43.610
add to as we progress throughout this class,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.080
and it will also develop as

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.905
a useful reference in the future too.

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:50.615
Thank you for your interest in this class,

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:53.550
and I'll see you in the first lesson.
