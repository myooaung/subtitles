00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.415
Welcome to the end of this section.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:06.880
As a little mini-challenge,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.080
I would like you to go ahead and

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.045
replicate what we can see on the screen just here.

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.635
We have some very basic HTML.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.240
The key part is openly top corner.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.699
What I would like you to do is to use JavaScript

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.800
to respond to the user's click on

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.630
this button and then it toggle between

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.500
the light and the dark mode and to do this,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.665
is actually not as difficult as it looks.

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:30.360
All we have if we go into the start files,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.280
is [inaudible] index page with all the texts,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.575
just like you see here,

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:36.270
we have our style sheets

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.050
and then currently inside the style sheet,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.700
we have the body section which sets

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.335
the default color to be light mode,

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:44.730
we have the light background color

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.870
and also the darker text.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.670
Then what I would like you to do is to listen out for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.410
a click event on the button

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.630
and then add the class of dark.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.190
This is going to do the opposite,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.050
we're going to set the lighter color for

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.370
the text and also the darker background color,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.240
give us a go using JavaScript,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.300
respond to the click at the dark mode class.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.565
Then also if you fill in confidence,

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:09.140
it would be good if you could add

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.815
an IF statement like we looked at in a previous video.

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:15.280
Also check if the dark mode is currently enabled,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.220
if it is, we then go in to remove

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.720
this class which will then

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.995
toggle back to the light state.

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:23.210
As a little guide to help with this

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.115
over the Mozilla website,

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:27.230
we can make use of a method called

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.900
contains and we can use this to

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.915
check if our elements contain a certain class.

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:34.865
In our case, we're going to check

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:36.590
all the classes which had been added to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.210
the body and then we'll check

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.085
if it contains the dark class.

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.550
If it does we'll then want to remove it.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.190
Give us a go, don't worry if

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.465
you get stuck along the way,

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:46.640
you can always refer back to

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.635
this video for some guidance.

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:50.835
Back inside of the index page,

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:52.905
let's jump up to the header section.

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:55.040
You can see here we have the initial button

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.660
which is the moon and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.925
then just below we have the HTML entity

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.345
which is going to be for the sun.

00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:04.020
With that in place, let's now go ahead with

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.720
my solution and if yours looks a little

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.060
bit different, it's completely fine.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.170
Jump into the script,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.165
inside of the script section,

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.210
the first thing we need to do is to grab

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.720
our button and store this inside the variable,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.225
with document.querySelector see in our button.

00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:26.360
This is a reference to our button

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.590
which we've just seen inside of

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.635
the HTML and we only have this single button,

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:33.870
this is fine like we've done many times of all,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.210
we then access our button element.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.595
We can then add an event listener

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:41.740
and this is going to listen out for a click event,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.450
this will trigger a function and let's call this function

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.320
toggleDarkMode which we can then set up just above.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.865
Back to our style sheets,

00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:02.595
let's just open this up and take a look inside.

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:04.900
As we've seen before, the body section has

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.510
the default light mode enabled,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.310
what we can then do is add

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.010
this dark class to the body which will then overrides

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.180
both the color and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.915
the background but just before we do this,

00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:18.250
we need to actually select

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.165
the body and store this inside of a constant,

00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:27.875
document.querySelector, that's in the body.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.770
Now we have a reference to this body,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.510
we can select this inside of

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.220
our function and we can use

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.710
this to add our new dark class,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.080
this was classlist,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.970
we use the add method,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.070
where we add the class of dark.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.620
Now, with this in place, we'll open up

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.030
our index page inside

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.930
the browser and this is our first step taken care of.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.890
We have the light mode enabled by

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.225
default and now if we click on the moon icon,

00:03:56.225 --> 00:03:58.040
this will end at the dark class

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.460
and also the corresponding colors.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.220
This is the simpler part,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.820
all we've done here is add a class but now we need a way

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.940
to figure out the opposite and remove this dark class.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.755
To do this, we can add an IF statement

00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:12.260
inside of our function and this is going to

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.180
check if the dark class has already been

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.155
applied before we add it just below.

00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:19.220
We can use the contains method

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.980
which we just looked at in the browser.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.810
What we need to do inside of the IF statement is to

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.065
check if the body contains this dark class.

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:28.850
We'll first just bold

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.860
check this inside of a console log,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.170
we can access the body,

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.170
the classlist and then use

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.790
the contains method to check if

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.440
this dark class has been applied.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.580
As you can see inside the documentation,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.625
this will return back a Boolean value of true or false,

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:49.535
we can then use this inside of the IF statement.

00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:52.220
This console log is at the top of the function,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.570
we'll check if this is true at

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.600
the beginning and then just after we add this,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.225
we'll check if this applies at the very end,

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:01.760
save this and over to the browser,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.045
jump into the developer tools,

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:06.900
reload and into the console.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.285
It doesn't like our empty IF statement,

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:11.400
we'll just remove this and

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.290
refresh and now if we toggle our button,

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.550
initially we see the value of false since

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.280
the first console log is at the top of our function

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.200
but then our second one is true

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.235
because we've added this dark class to our body.

00:05:24.235 --> 00:05:26.145
Great, now we know this works, we can remove

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:27.990
our console logs and we can now

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.465
apply this to our IF statements.

00:05:30.465 --> 00:05:33.015
Just like the logs, we'll check if the

00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:39.420
body.classlist contains the class of dark,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.570
if it does the code inside will

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.985
run and what code do we want to run exactly?

00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:46.820
Well, if we think about this we tried

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.190
to toggle the dark mode on and off,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.365
the dark mode is already applied,

00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:53.905
we want to remove this class from the body,

00:05:53.905 --> 00:05:56.475
we can do this by accessing the

00:05:56.475 --> 00:05:59.210
body.classlist and then use

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.905
the remove method which will remove our dark class,

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:06.330
save this and try this out inside the browser,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.070
the default is light mode.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.735
We now have the dark mode

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.480
but if we tried to click on this again,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.710
it doesn't yet return back to our light mode.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.200
The reason why, is because of inside of our function,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.970
whatever we do at the beginning of

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.340
this function will always still apply in

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.470
the dark mode class and the way

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.850
to get around this is inside of our IF statements.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.250
If we add the return keyword,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.975
if the IF statement is true and the code inside will run,

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:35.855
this return statement will break out of our function,

00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:38.440
the code just below will not run.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.330
Effectively, if the IF statement is triggered,

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.240
only this block of code will run.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.585
If it's not triggered,

00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:47.555
this section at the bottom will run instead.

00:06:47.555 --> 00:06:51.955
Try this one more time, refresh the browser.

00:06:51.955 --> 00:06:55.460
Our toggle button will now work correctly.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.290
The remaining steps was to change

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.925
this icon in the top corner,

00:06:58.925 --> 00:07:01.555
to change between the sun and the moon.

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:04.130
We already have access to our button,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.725
so we can select this inside of our function.

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:09.530
First, just above the return statements,

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.230
we'll access our button and we can change

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.550
the inner HTML to be equal to our HTML entity.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.500
In this IF statement, we are removing the dark mode,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.325
we then want to provide a reference

00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:24.910
of the moon then reselect it.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.060
Go to our index page,

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.270
grab the entity which is

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.715
the moon which is co-reactive, so select this,

00:07:32.715 --> 00:07:35.750
paste this in as a string and just below,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.160
we can also set the color of

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.585
these elements with the style property,

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:49.470
set the color equal to an RGB value of 62, 62, 62.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.080
Outside of the IF statement,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.290
we want to do the opposite,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.080
if we copy both of these lines,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.215
we just add it in the bottom of our function.

00:07:57.215 --> 00:07:58.910
The inner HTML is going to be

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.090
our moon icon which is this one in

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.855
the comment then you save it,

00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:08.325
add also the color,

00:08:08.325 --> 00:08:10.305
I'm going to go for aqua.

00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:14.535
We'll try this out, toggle to the dark mode.

00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:15.750
I'm looking then at re-enabled

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.430
the light mode with the sun icon,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.025
click on this and this will then reinstate the moon.

00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:23.170
We can then toggle back to the dark mode.
