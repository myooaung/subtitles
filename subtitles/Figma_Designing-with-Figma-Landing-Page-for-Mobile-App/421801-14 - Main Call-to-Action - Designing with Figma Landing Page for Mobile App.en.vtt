00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.705
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:10.440
In this lesson, we'll be designing the main call-to-action,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.670
and this is arguably

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.505
the most important section in the page because it can be a deal breaker.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:26.460
Visitors will use this section to buy the product or download the free version,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.210
but essentially, this is where the users are converting.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.500
Let's make sure we do this right,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.670
and let's get to it.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.580
A quick glance at the wire-frame shows us that, originally,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:53.685
I had planned to create the pricing area and the call-to-action separately,

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:58.115
but I think it's a much better idea to incorporate both of these

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:02.700
into a single section because it makes sense right.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.745
If I were to do them separately,

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:06.910
I would have two sets of buttons,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.855
but if I merge them,

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:11.915
I'm going to have a single set of buttons.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:16.320
It's much clearer that way.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.840
Also, this column of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.930
the pricing table is for the pro version or the paid version of the app,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.195
so we need to make this stand out somehow.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:35.105
All right, let's get to it.

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:42.140
We're going to start by typing the text that we'll use for the section heading.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.645
Let's actually go ahead and copy these, paste them in here.

00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:53.335
I think we're going to use the exact same styles that we used here.

00:01:53.335 --> 00:01:57.495
Let's do a copy paste.

00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:00.630
Copy properties, paste properties,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.125
and the same goes for this, copy and paste.

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:10.410
Let's align them to the center,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.570
and let's also align them to the central with each other.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.255
Let's shift A and add 32 pixels of distance between them.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:27.255
Okay. Great. Now, let's go ahead and add our pricing table.

00:02:27.255 --> 00:02:29.860
For this, here's what we'll do.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.000
We'll start by bringing in the logo.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.415
We'll go to brand assets, logo color,

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:43.760
and let's resize this logo so it's 48 pixels in height.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.480
We're going to use the colored version for the first column of the pricing table.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.660
Here, we basically need to display the word free to show the price of the plan,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.685
then the list of features,

00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:07.635
and the call-to-action, the button for download.

00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:11.735
That should be relatively easy to do.

00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:18.435
Let's grab this text and we're going to paste it here.

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:22.290
It's just going to say free.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.245
I'm going to zoom in a little bit so you can see what we're doing.

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:28.990
Again, this we'll align it to the center,

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.040
we'll align it with the logo.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.165
We'll shift A, these two to add auto layout,

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:38.900
and we'll set 32 pixels of distance between them.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.360
Next, let's add the list of features.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.475
For that, I'm going to grab a simple paragraph.

00:03:51.475 --> 00:03:53.395
Let's paste it in here,

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:59.290
and let's start typing in the features.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.180
Now, we'll align these in the middle.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.750
Font size, 18, line height,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.325
let's choose 32 pixels because I want these to be spaced out a little bit more,

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:17.980
and finally, what we need is one of those fancy buttons that we made.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.150
Copy that, paste it in.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.155
Now what we can do is we can select everything,

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:33.315
shifts A to add an auto layout.

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:36.105
Make sure to uncheck this bit.

00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:38.415
It's going to be vertical,

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:42.330
and we're going to do 64 pixels,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:51.030
horizontal, vertical, padding, and also 64 spacing between items.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.410
To this, we can actually add a fill color of white.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.750
Let's add a drop shadow,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.720
and let's also round off the corners.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.390
Eight pixels should do just fine.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:12.519
All right so now, this element should fit within four of these grid columns.

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:17.560
If it doesn't, we can simply resize

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.505
this element because this is what gives this entire frame its width.

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:26.590
If you don't understand that,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.990
here's a very simple explanation.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.680
This piece of text,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.140
this text box, has a width currently of 260 pixels.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.079
The frame that I created with auto layout,

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:49.670
which is this, has a horizontal padding of 64 pixels.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.350
Besides these 260, we need to add 64 to the left,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.495
64 to the right.

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:05.965
Whenever I re-size this text box,

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:10.345
my entire frame resizes along with it.

00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:13.455
It's quite simple actually.

00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:15.890
We can do that until we get to

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:23.039
the perfect width so that it fits within four grid columns.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:32.315
Now, let's duplicate this and create the column for the pro version.

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:38.675
Now, if you remember what I said previously about making this stand out,

00:06:38.675 --> 00:06:40.520
because this is, after all,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.110
for the pro version,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.140
there's a very simple way we can do that.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.545
Instead of using white fill,

00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:50.770
we can use our main gradient.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:59.780
Then we can simply select this logo and we can make

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:12.735
everything white, like so.

00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:17.930
Then I can select this entire element,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.630
and I can change the colors to white.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.590
Now, this description is not entirely accurate because we need to add a few things.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.975
The pro version has

00:07:37.975 --> 00:07:44.180
all the features in free plus multiple budgets,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.280
goal tracking, sync between devices,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.425
reports and sync with your bank.

00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:55.875
This, I'm going to make bold,

00:07:55.875 --> 00:08:01.500
and I'm going to be using my secondary color, which is this.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.220
I'm going to set it to a 100 percent.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.950
Let's not forget to change the price.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:20.200
This is going to be $9.99 per month.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.040
Let's also change the style of this button.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.295
I'm going to use these same secondary color

00:08:30.295 --> 00:08:36.945
for the background and for the text inside,

00:08:36.945 --> 00:08:38.610
I'm going to use gray,

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.075
maybe 80 percent, something like that.

00:08:42.075 --> 00:08:48.015
Cool. Now, let's group these up.

00:08:48.015 --> 00:08:53.895
Let's position these at 64 pixels from the text above.

00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:55.950
Let's group them up,

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.330
Command G. What do you think?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.580
Should we end here?

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.980
How does this look to you?

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:12.140
Personally, I think we could use with a bit more separation

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:18.215
from the section above and also a bit more emphasis on this section because after all,

00:09:18.215 --> 00:09:24.765
this is the most important section in the page, right?

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:28.830
To keep up with our motif here,

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.635
what I'm going to do is simply copy this angle, the stripe.

00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:37.210
I'm going to paste it in here.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.785
I'm just going to nudge it until I find the right balance,

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:54.820
and I'm also going to make it bigger, like so.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:03.100
I'm going to put it under our newly created group.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.635
Then I'm going to take this,

00:10:06.635 --> 00:10:11.400
I'm going to put it inside like so.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.840
I think that looks pretty good,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.980
maybe just a tad bigger.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.920
Yeah, that looks pretty good.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.230
Now, we just have to play around with the gradient's a little bit.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:40.495
Let's open up our plugin and let's do something with a nice shade of blue here,

00:10:40.495 --> 00:10:44.404
maybe something like that or like that.

00:10:44.404 --> 00:10:47.670
I don't want something that's too dark,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:54.200
but I don't want something that's too heavily colored either.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.680
I think maybe I'll leave it to that because it also

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.265
has some colors that can be found on this section here.

00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:07.920
That's good. Also, I'm going to duplicate it,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.720
rotate it a little bit.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:19.000
For it, we can even use a different set of colors,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.695
maybe something like this,

00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:23.515
or maybe something a little bit more subdued.

00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:28.550
We can even lower the opacity on this layer.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.975
I think that looks just about right.

00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:40.225
Of course, you can always go in and nibble at the details,

00:11:40.225 --> 00:11:43.870
get everything tuned in, just right,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:49.220
but for now, I think this is good enough.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.260
As the final thing,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.460
as we're always doing,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.280
select everything, Command G, to group everything.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:03.030
We're going to call this main C-T-A or call-to-action.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.550
Cool.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.220
All right, as you saw in this lesson,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.720
I veered away from our following the wire frame and instead,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.480
I created my own layout.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.255
That's totally okay to do.

00:12:30.255 --> 00:12:32.750
As I was saying in a previous lesson,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.955
the wire frame is there to guide you,

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:40.830
and it's there to serve as a guide for the contents really,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.080
not necessarily for the layout.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:49.115
This section here was a fine example of that.

00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:51.185
Now, as per usual,

00:12:51.185 --> 00:12:54.920
go ahead and create your own version of this main call-to-action,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.360
either by following the wire frame or do exactly what I did,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.415
or just come up with something new.

00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:03.605
It's entirely up to you.

00:13:03.605 --> 00:13:06.290
Now, once you do this,

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.460
you're ready for the final section of the page,

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.865
and that is the footer.

00:13:12.865 --> 00:13:15.880
That's coming up in the next lesson.
