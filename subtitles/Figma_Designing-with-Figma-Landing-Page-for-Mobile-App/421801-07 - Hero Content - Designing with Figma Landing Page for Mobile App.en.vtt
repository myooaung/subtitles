00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.525
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:10.800
In this lesson, we're going to finish designing the hero section.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.155
Previously, we created the structure for it with the grid,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.140
the logo, navigation, and background.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.340
Now, it's time to add the contents. Let's get started.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.315
The hero content, if we look at the wireframe,

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:36.359
is comprised of a media object which can be image,

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.590
video whatever, and a title,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.400
subtitle and that's uncalled option.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.840
We have this button,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.365
and this link which probably just takes to a pop up video, I imagine.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.090
To make things easier for us,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.350
let's select all of these elements.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.570
Actually, let's select this entire group where it says content,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.060
and I'm just going to paste it in here.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.975
Now, let's tackle the heading first.

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.225
Here's a quick tip for you.

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:18.245
If you want to select an element that's inside a group,

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:26.255
normally you'll need to select the group and then double-click to enter inside the group.

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:30.680
But if you want to do that without double clicking,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.965
you can hold down Command on Mac,

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:36.580
or Control on Windows.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.595
That will allow you to click and select

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:46.255
any element regardless of how deep it is in the layer structure.

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:52.415
For the heading, we're going to change its color to white.

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:55.320
Then we're going to go back to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.250
our typography and we're going to use the style of Heading 1.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.675
Now, you can glance over these values

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:11.560
and commit them to memory and then replicate them on the other side,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.285
or you can right-click, go to Copy/Paste,

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:19.940
Copy Properties, and then you can come back to main design,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.935
right-click, Copy/Paste, Paste Properties.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:28.050
That will change everything,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.575
the font family, weight,

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:33.935
the font size, the line height, all of it.

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:42.110
Now all we have to do is basically change the color back and let's bring up the grid,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.390
let's align this to the grid,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.780
and we're going to change the width of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.575
this element so that it spans on seven columns.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.870
We have 1, 2, 3,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.345
4, 5, 6, 7.

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:03.210
Next, let's target this bit.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:11.720
For this, let's go back to typography and select a style that would work best for us.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.455
In our case, we'll probably be using Heading 5.

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:19.320
Right click, Copy/Paste, Copy Properties,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.940
go back and Paste Properties.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.060
Now, this doesn't really work that well in medium,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.800
so let's switch back to regular.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.875
You can make these changes, no problem.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:41.075
Let's resize this as well and let's actually change to auto width.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:47.945
That means the text box will resize to the maximum width of the text inside it.

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:51.620
Let's switch its color to white,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.845
and let's use a more subdued tint,

00:03:55.845 --> 00:03:58.020
60 percent, let's say.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.860
Awesome. We're making great progress.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.215
Now, let's look at this button.

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:08.970
For this button, I want the text to say, download for free,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.820
but I would also like a nice arrow to sit right next to it.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.649
I'm going to show you an amazing way of creating buttons in Figma

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:28.520
that allows you to type any text you want in them and they'll resize automatically.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.035
That's with the help of our trusty friend auto layout.

00:04:35.035 --> 00:04:41.024
What I'm going to do is select the text itself,

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:47.130
and I'm actually going to move this outside,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.445
and I'm going to ungroup this.

00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:51.840
With the Text selected,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.440
press ''Shift+A'' to add auto layout,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.140
and I'm going to select 32 pixels,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.304
horizontal padding, 16 pixels,

00:05:00.304 --> 00:05:04.880
vertical padding, and 16 pixels spacing between items.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:12.630
Now what I can do is I can add a fill color and I'm going to add fill white 100 percent.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.355
I'm also going to add a 100 pixel corner radius.

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.350
Do you know why I did that?

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.625
Because if we're going to take a look at the project brief,

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:29.240
under design considerations, the client tells us that,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.455
"Hey, we like pill and ghost buttons."

00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:37.760
A pill button is the one with very rounded corners.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.135
It looks like an actual pill.

00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:48.875
With that done, I can select the text inside it and I can set it to my primary color.

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.824
Let's go to Colors,

00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:56.685
select my primary, let's come back and paste it in.

00:05:56.685 --> 00:05:59.690
Now as far as the text is concerned,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.655
we're going to use Brandon Grotesque.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:07.535
Let me actually zoom in here.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:11.334
We're going to use bold 18 pixels,

00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:14.400
24 for line height,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.965
and we should be good to go.

00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:22.520
Now, I'm also going to add a drop shadow to it.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.350
I'm going to select my frame,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.285
which I'm going to call Button,

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:32.100
and under effects, I'm going to choose Drop shadow.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.260
The same one that we used for these elements here.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.765
The last thing that we need to do here is to add a nice arrow.

00:06:41.765 --> 00:06:47.115
For that, I'm going to go to my app here,

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.035
I'm going to search for arrow,

00:06:49.035 --> 00:06:54.630
and we're going to choose the arrow right from the Microns set.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.025
So click and drag and drop it in.

00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:05.475
Here, we're going to keep it at 24 pixels and I'm going to hit ''Command+X.''

00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:11.465
I'm going to select this text and Command+V+V or Control+V for on Windows.

00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:18.915
This is going to paste it right next to that text inside my button frame.

00:07:18.915 --> 00:07:25.300
All I got to do now is change the color to the same color as the text.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.215
Here, I'm going to give you another pro tip.

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:31.180
When working in Figma,

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.510
and you want to change the color on multiple elements,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:40.660
you can select the parent element and when you see selection colors,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:47.090
this will basically give you the colors of every single element in that selection.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.160
If I want to change the color of this arrow to the color of this text,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.770
all I got to do is copy the color of the text,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.065
paste it in, and I'm good to go.

00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:04.770
Now our button is complete,

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.530
and because I'm using auto layout,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.139
I can change the text on this button,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.515
like so and the button will resize automatically.

00:08:17.515 --> 00:08:19.225
How cool is that?

00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:27.430
Of course, I can also change the padding and the distance between items.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:34.400
I can do this, and I can do this.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:43.620
I can do this. Well, that was a very large value, but you get the point.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:50.040
I get very fine control over how this looks like and it's super easy to use.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.045
Now, let's see about this video introduction link.

00:08:54.045 --> 00:08:59.340
For it, I'm going to be using my secondary color.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.995
Let's select that, copy it,

00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:05.790
paste it in, type face.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.670
We're going to use Brandon Grotesque again,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:14.220
18, 24 and Bold.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.855
The last thing to do is add a little icon to it as well,

00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:22.545
because I wanted to show the fact that,

00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:26.010
hey, if you click this link a video is going to play.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.760
So we need an icon that says play.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.100
We have this one or if we go to Ionicons,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.790
we will get this one.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.970
Drag and drop. I'm going to resize to 24,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:52.950
like so and I'm going to select the icon and the text.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.565
I'm going to press "Shift + A" to create an auto layout.

00:09:57.565 --> 00:09:59.930
Now, when doing this,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:05.135
you can align elements in a number of different ways.

00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:08.915
If the auto layout was horizontal,

00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:15.300
you can align elements at the top, center, or bottom.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.810
If your auto layout is set to vertical,

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:24.525
you can align elements left, center, and right.

00:10:24.525 --> 00:10:27.250
This is what it's doing.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:38.440
You can also choose to move up an element or move down.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.020
Of course, if the layout is in horizontal mode,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.665
you can move elements left and right.

00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:52.020
You can also use the keyboard shortcuts left, right, top, bottom.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.020
In my case, I'm going to choose to align

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:01.930
this icon in the middle and also this text in the middle.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.820
As for distance between items,

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.325
I'm going to choose 16 pixels.

00:11:08.325 --> 00:11:16.635
I'm going to make sure that I am using the same color on this icon.

00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:24.645
Now what you can do is you can group up these two elements with auto layout.

00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:31.515
You can press "Shift + A" and that's going to create another frame for both of them.

00:11:31.515 --> 00:11:37.200
It can set its spacing between items to 32.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.255
By default, this will align these elements in the middle.

00:11:42.255 --> 00:11:47.535
Now, I want the same distance between these three elements.

00:11:47.535 --> 00:11:52.215
What I can do is I can select all of them by holding down "Shift".

00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:56.400
I can do "Shift + A" to add auto-layout.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.970
I'm simply going to change the distance between them or the spacing between them to 32.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:11.520
Also, I'm going to make sure that all of these are aligned to the left. Like so.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.855
Now the last thing to do is to position this content at

00:12:15.855 --> 00:12:20.910
a respectable distance from the header.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.250
In our case it's 96 pixels,

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.385
which incidentally is a multiple of eight.

00:12:26.385 --> 00:12:29.355
I'm actually going to keep this positioning.

00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:32.114
But if you want to position it differently,

00:12:32.114 --> 00:12:38.115
you would use the up and down arrow keys.

00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:44.519
Cool. Now, this is the first part of the content.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:50.190
The last part is to add this media object.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.935
Here's how we'll go about that.

00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:55.560
We're going to start by creating

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.180
a simple shape and we're going to add a border radius of 8,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.880
a height of 240 pixels.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.765
What about the width?

00:13:06.765 --> 00:13:08.880
Well, for the width,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.750
you can go basically any width you want.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:18.120
But what I'd like to do is I like to use a 16 by 9 ratio.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.465
I have a cool little plugin for that.

00:13:21.465 --> 00:13:24.360
It's called Aspects.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:30.600
You can find this in the Figma plugins directory.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.080
Just search for aspects and you'll find it.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.260
This allows me to select an element,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.170
choose an aspect ratio,

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:45.195
and choose a property to resize based on that aspect ratio.

00:13:45.195 --> 00:13:47.970
In my case, I want to change the width because

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.060
the height is set at it's correct dimensions.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:59.055
I'm going to hit apply and this changed the width to 427 pixels.

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:06.405
Now I have a perfectly sized shape for a 16 by 9 ratio.

00:14:06.405 --> 00:14:14.835
With the selected, what I can do now is click it and under Fill,

00:14:14.835 --> 00:14:18.210
select "Image", choose "Image".

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.240
I can open my landing page starter kit,

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:29.895
go to Placeholder images and I can choose any of the images from this UI kit.

00:14:29.895 --> 00:14:36.480
Let's choose "Main". Here you have several options for how the image behaves.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.040
You can choose between Fill,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.605
Fit, Crop, and Tile.

00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:43.575
In my case, I'm just going to leave it on Fill.

00:14:43.575 --> 00:14:51.690
Then I'm going to select this and I'm going to add a drop shadow. Like so.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:57.570
Now what I want to do is create a nice grid out of these images.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.540
I'm going to select "Duplicate" and I'm going to position

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.975
this at 32 pixels from the other one.

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:07.200
Let's duplicate again, 32 pixels.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.350
Let's do that again.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.540
Let's do that again.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:22.665
Let's do a third column. Like so.

00:15:22.665 --> 00:15:28.530
Now, let's go ahead and add some fresh images here.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.800
Actually to make it more interesting, here's what we'll do,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.670
we'll delete the top images here.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:45.730
We're going to move these up like so.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:52.885
It just adds a little bit of a more visual interest.

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:55.405
Let's change the images now.

00:15:55.405 --> 00:16:00.490
When you have a rectangle shape with an image fill,

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:05.785
you can actually double-click it to open up the fill dialogue.

00:16:05.785 --> 00:16:07.780
So let's choose another image,

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:14.060
maybe this one and let's do the same for the rest.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.345
All right, so once you're happy with the result, here's what you do.

00:16:28.345 --> 00:16:32.590
You select all of these and you go right here where

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.300
it says components and select create component.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:43.210
Now, components and fig-ma allow you to reuse certain elements.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:53.965
Making any changes to the parent component will change the child components as well.

00:16:53.965 --> 00:16:59.620
If I were to duplicate this component in another page and I would make changes to

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:06.285
this master instance those changes will be reflected in the other pages as well.

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:09.735
Now that I have that turned into a component,

00:17:09.735 --> 00:17:13.435
I can select it and I can rotate it.

00:17:13.435 --> 00:17:21.415
We're going to use the same 16 degrees rotation that we used on these elements.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:24.460
Remember this number 16 degrees.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:30.970
We'll be using this quite often in the design of this page.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.075
Now it's rotated.

00:17:34.075 --> 00:17:36.670
I can move it in

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:44.575
its final position and this really is up to you and how you want it to look like.

00:17:44.575 --> 00:17:49.435
In my case I'm probably just going to leave it something like that

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:54.685
or something else I can do is the following.

00:17:54.685 --> 00:17:59.155
I can change the image here to the main image.

00:17:59.155 --> 00:18:03.805
I can choose to hide this image completely

00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:09.190
and I can even slide it in something like this and I can move it

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:14.020
down so that the text here kind of

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:21.985
interweaves with this image maybe a bit more like this.

00:18:21.985 --> 00:18:29.845
Again, this is a matter of personal preference but I think that will look pretty good.

00:18:29.845 --> 00:18:31.690
Go ahead and fiddle with this,

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.425
play around, see what looks best for you.

00:18:35.425 --> 00:18:39.055
Now speaking of what looks best,

00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:41.470
take a closer look at this shadow.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:48.010
See how it's cut off right here?

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:55.060
That's because when you're adding or when you're creating a frame with auto layout,

00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.520
it usually will check out this box where it says clip content

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:07.450
and that will basically clip any content that is outside the boundaries of that frame.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.469
In our case, the shadow is outside the boundaries.

00:19:11.469 --> 00:19:22.195
I can uncheck this and then we can go in even deeper and uncheck this box and now,

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:26.030
see how the shadow's showing up.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:34.690
This is something you can do when you see this happening.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.070
When an image that should be outside the bounds of

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.410
your frame doesn't show up usually this is the culprit right here.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:50.605
All right, there's one final small thing that we need to do here.

00:19:50.605 --> 00:20:00.460
Right here at the bottom we're going to add a little icon that will let users know that,

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.875
'hey, you can scroll down this page.'

00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:07.165
To create that start with a rectangle.

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:12.430
We're going to set its width to 24, it's height to 48,

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.520
its radius to 100,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.650
and we're actually going to remove

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.535
the fill color and we're going to add a stroke or a border,

00:20:21.535 --> 00:20:24.430
and the border is going to be white.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:30.310
It's going to be inside one pixel and then inside that

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:36.445
we're going to create a nice circle using the ellipse tool.

00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:41.980
When using the ellipse tool we can free hand it or we can hold down

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:47.830
shift and it's going to snap to the same width and height.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.325
Let's make this very small,

00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:53.545
six by six should do the trick.

00:20:53.545 --> 00:21:02.020
Fill white, and then just move it inside my little icon here.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.545
You can set it at eight pixels from the top.

00:21:05.545 --> 00:21:06.940
That should do the trick.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.420
Select both, command G to group them all together,

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.275
and name it scroll or whatever you want it to be.

00:21:14.275 --> 00:21:22.870
Now let's bring up the grid and let's align it to the grid. Like so.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.940
Obviously you don't have to align it to the grid if you feel It looks better

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:33.550
in a particular position like so you can do that-no problem.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.700
Just because we're using a grid it doesn't mean

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.345
that we have to align every single thing to it.

00:21:40.345 --> 00:21:45.710
That is the finished hero section.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.930
All right, now it's your turn to finish the hero section.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.405
If you've already done that, fantastic.

00:22:04.405 --> 00:22:05.965
If not, go ahead,

00:22:05.965 --> 00:22:11.560
watch this lesson again if you have to and complete this section.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.230
Now, you'll find that,

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.260
this is something very interesting I've been meaning to tell you,

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.465
you'll find that in most cases,

00:22:19.465 --> 00:22:25.465
the hero or the header part of a website is the most difficult one to make.

00:22:25.465 --> 00:22:27.310
I don't know why that is,

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:32.635
but usually once you get it done it's just smooth sailing from that point on.

00:22:32.635 --> 00:22:36.970
I think it's because after you complete

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:42.340
the header or the hero section you have a foundation to build on, right?

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.420
You have a starting point.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:50.845
So I think mentally it just makes it easier for you to get things going.

00:22:50.845 --> 00:22:53.485
We're now ready to move on.

00:22:53.485 --> 00:22:59.245
The next section on our list is the first section for features.

00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:03.110
We'll tackle that in the next lesson. See you there.
