00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.155
[MUSIC]Welcome back to the class.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:11.255
We've made great progress with this landing page design.

00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:16.530
We just have to design three more sections and we're done.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.985
In this lesson, we're going to create the testimonial sections.

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:23.320
Ready? Let's go.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.440
So let's check out the wire frame first to see what we're dealing with.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.295
Initially, my idea was to just

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:39.440
have a list of avatars here and when you click on an avatar,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.140
the testimonial itself would change.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.265
I think what we're going to keep things a lot simpler than that,

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:50.120
and just do a navigation with right arrow,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.095
left arrow and that's it.

00:00:53.095 --> 00:01:01.925
Let's go back here. Let's go to typography and grab this block quote that I have here,

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:06.145
paste that in, and let's bring in the grid.

00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:14.079
Let's properly align this to the grid and size it to be 10 columns,

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.250
right in the middle of the page.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.790
Let's also change the text color to grade 80 percent.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.220
To mark the fact that this is a section for testimonials,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.595
let's go ahead and add one of these, a quote.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:39.405
This will use Brandon grotesque.

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:47.435
Let's do a really big font size and let's make it bold and I think a little bit bigger,

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:49.535
something like a 110.

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:52.730
It doesn't really matter that we're not sticking exactly to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.540
the type scale right now because this is a decorative element.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.210
So a 110 and that should be okay.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.775
Let's change the color, actually,

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:08.190
let's use this one,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.549
but a little bit more subdued,

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.550
like 80 percent, something like that.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.480
That looks good, let's select both of these aligned to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.945
the center and we're going to align things like so.

00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:27.090
Then under the actual quote,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.750
we're going to put an avatar of the quote,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:39.545
author, name and perhaps position and then the arrow navigation.

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:45.300
40 avatar, we're going to grab the ellipse tool or

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.920
O on the keyboard and we're going to make an ellipse that's 64 by 64.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.465
That should do the trick.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:57.905
We don't need a very large avatar.

00:02:57.905 --> 00:03:02.360
We're going to position this at 32 pixels from

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.100
the blackboard above and we need to put a portrait in there.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.500
There are lots of different ways to do that.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.185
You can download a free image from the internet,

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:17.650
if you want to do a placeholder.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.960
If you're doing a real project,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.085
then you would put the picture of the person who actually gave you that testimonial.

00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:32.350
In my case, I just want a place holder image so I can open up a plugin called unsplash.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.785
This is for the unsplash website and I can search for a portrait.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:45.350
I can use that one and that's just going to fill in nicely like so.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.250
For the name and position,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.600
let's actually grab this type

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:02.900
of text style and let's actually do a shift a to add an auto Layout.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.060
Make sure you delete the default padding that are added.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.320
We're going to do 16 pixels of distance between items or spacing between items.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.620
We're going to make things vertical and I'm going to paste in

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.095
that element and then just change the color.

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:27.870
I'm going to use 80 percent gray.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.420
We're just going to say Mary Anne,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:42.585
Attorney, cool.

00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:45.635
Now let's take this alignment in the center.

00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:51.890
Make sure we position it 32 pixels from the actual quote and

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.990
then let's grab the left and right arrows.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:08.985
Paste this in. Like so duplicate it,

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:13.510
move it to the side, right-click, flip horizontal.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.870
Let's do a 10 percent opacity on this one.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.055
Actually let's do it on the layer itself, like so.

00:05:25.055 --> 00:05:30.800
This will show us how an inactive arrow looks like.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:41.180
Let's shift A these to add auto-layout and let's set 16 pixel distance between the two.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.945
We can go even higher than that 32 pixels,

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:50.795
because maybe in the future we want to add

00:05:50.795 --> 00:06:00.485
some fill to the space around them and we need to have the room for us to do that.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:09.135
I'm going to take these and I'm going to position them 72 pixels from the author.

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:13.035
Now take all of this,

00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:19.920
command G and let's call this testimonials.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.870
Make sure it's properly aligned in the middle and let's position it

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.455
at 240 pixels from the section above.

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:37.750
Now let's do another bird's eye view to check if everything looks good and it does.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:51.690
[MUSIC]

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.630
Did you see how simple it was to design this testimonial section?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.240
Obviously, there are many ways to do it.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.245
You can go with grids.

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:05.394
You can go with a different type of slider.

00:07:05.394 --> 00:07:09.085
It's really up to your imagination.

00:07:09.085 --> 00:07:17.825
Go ahead and create this or your own version of the testimonials and once you do that,

00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:19.475
we're ready to move on.

00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:24.755
The next item on our to-do list is

00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:31.715
probably the most important section of the page and that is the main call to action.

00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:37.850
It's quite a complex section because it contains a pricing table.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.765
Nothing we can't handle,

00:07:39.765 --> 00:07:44.010
but it can be a little bit tricky.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.120
Let's see how we can create that in the next lesson.
