00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.450
Hello and welcome to the first lesson of this class where I'll give you

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.250
a more in-depth look at what we'll be creating.We'll also go

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.315
over the class projects so you can see what you need to create

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:24.074
when taking this class.You will also learn why I chose this project,

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:30.235
how it might be beneficial for you and also what you need to do to get started.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:36.920
Let's begin.This is the final landing page

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.715
that will be creating.As I was saying in the introduction video,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:44.945
this is for a mobile budgeting app.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.475
Now this is of course,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:51.620
a fictional product.These images here are just placeholders,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.650
there demo images taken from a UI kit.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.890
But let me quickly walk you through what we have.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.970
At the very top,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.085
we start with a hero area that has a selection of screenshots from the app,

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:08.375
as well as our navigation and content.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:12.200
Scrolling down, we find the first section,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.220
four features, where each feature is displayed in this grid manner.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.020
Then we have a second section,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.070
four features. Moving on.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.810
We have a small call to action.That's followed by the third section four

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:39.970
features.Then we have a screenshot gallery that's followed by testimonials.Finally,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:49.050
we have the main call to action and pricing table.At the very end,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.585
we have a footer.

00:01:51.585 --> 00:02:00.275
This might look like it's a lot of work.But we'll take things step-by-step,

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:06.250
will break down this page into smaller, manageable chunks.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.000
We'll do one section at a time.You'll see that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.950
it's really not that complicated to create something like this.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.415
Alright, so now for the class project,

00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:30.740
your task will be to create a landing page starting from this wire-frame.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.015
I'll show you this in a little bit.

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:37.985
This is the same wire-frame that I'm starting from.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:43.360
You'll need to do the same to end up with this.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.760
Now, your final product doesn't have to look exactly the same as mine.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm going to show you one way to do it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.385
Obviously you can follow exactly what I do and end up with an identical result.

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:04.365
That's totally okay.

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:09.955
But I do encourage you to experiment a little bit and put your own spin on things.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:14.020
For example, you might want to use a different set of

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.220
colors or you might want to use a different set of typefaces,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.125
maybe arrange elements differently in the page.

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:28.010
I'm going to give you all the tools you need to do

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.270
that and I'm going to show you how to use those tools.But in the end,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:40.025
it's really up to you to determine how you want this final result to look like.Now,

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:43.070
let me show you how you can do that.First of all,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.400
I've put together a landing page starter kit.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.965
You'll need to download this first.

00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:50.930
Inside the starter kits,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.490
we have some brand assets which essentially are just two versions of

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.080
the placeholder logo that we'll be using.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.990
We also have some demo images that we'll be using.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.740
Then we have a project brief.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.660
The project brief is a PDF document and this resembles

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.125
something that you would receive from a client, right?

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:17.960
Our clients as a fictional one,

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.760
it's called Numm Inc..

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.385
Inside the project brief,

00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:27.060
we have some background on the client and the company.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.880
We have the taglines that we need to use for this project.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.810
I assumed that the client's marketing team put together

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.735
this document and they basically just gave us everything we need.

00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:48.360
What kind of taglines to use,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.665
what kind of titles, subtitles,

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:55.930
button text to use for the call to actions.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.110
Everything is here.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.845
Then they currently laid out some product features for us.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:07.250
You can see that the features are categorized.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.475
Then we have individual features.

00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:12.440
We can see the feature title,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.480
description and so on.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.890
Everything is here.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.835
Then we have pricing information for the product,

00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:25.760
some testimonials, and then the proposed page structure.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.500
Finally, at the end, some design considerations.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.365
What kind of colors does the client like?

00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:42.275
What kind of style can we use for the design?

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:46.450
Also, what kind of websites does the client like?

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.040
You can see they sent us three examples here.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.520
This is, again, typically the kind of document you would

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.960
receive from a client when doing a project like this.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:08.955
At any point, it can come back to this project brief and learn all the details you need.

00:06:08.955 --> 00:06:10.955
Now based on that project brief,

00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:14.795
I went ahead and designed this wire-frame.

00:06:14.795 --> 00:06:17.930
A wire-frame is basically a

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:24.695
sketch.It's a low fidelity representation of the final product.

00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:27.140
You don't have to take this literally.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.110
A wire-frame just serves as a starting point, as a guideline.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.490
It's there to show you what kind of content you need to add to your

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.615
page.It doesn't mean that the layout

00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:46.515
that we used in the wire-frame needs to be in the final product.

00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:50.375
For example, the layout for this hero section

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:54.665
just shows me an image on the right and the content on the left.

00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:58.085
But if we look at the final product,

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:03.320
we can see that we have an image on the right and the content on the left,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.860
but it doesn't resemble anything like this.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.995
Look at this section,

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:13.075
this is for the features.

00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:16.840
In the wireframe, I imagine that maybe we need to have

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.795
some image here on the left and then the features on the right,

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:22.900
but on the final result,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.240
we don't have that image on the left,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.160
anywhere, we just have a grid of icons.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.730
What about the other section for features?

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.195
Here's how it looks in the wireframe,

00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:37.140
and here's how it looks here.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:43.219
Here I added an image that wasn't here in the wireframe,

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:48.755
and I also chose to display these features like so.

00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:51.610
I hope you understand what I'm trying to say here.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.620
Use the wireframe as a guide for the content that you need to use,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.040
not the actual layout.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.000
In the starter kit,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.110
you will also find a resources.pdf file.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.935
In here, you'll find a complete list of resources

00:08:09.935 --> 00:08:13.925
that are used in the design like the logo,

00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:15.365
the images, the icons,

00:08:15.365 --> 00:08:19.475
illustrations, and also some useful links.

00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:25.400
Whenever you cannot find a resource that I use to

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.445
make sure to check back to this document and you'll definitely find a link there.

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:38.740
Now, how do you get started and get everything set up for the main lessons?

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.415
Well, first of all, you need to download this starter kit.

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:47.935
You will find a link to it in the class description.

00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:49.840
After you do that,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.590
go ahead and create a Figma account.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:58.565
Go to figma.com and if you don't have an account,

00:08:58.565 --> 00:09:02.825
click Sign up, and follow the instructions there.

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:04.525
If you do have an account,

00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:07.235
then simply go ahead and login.

00:09:07.235 --> 00:09:17.475
Step number 3 is to open the starter kit or the starter Figma file that I provided.

00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:20.205
Let me show you what that looks like.It's

00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:25.750
a relatively blank Figma file with four pages that I made for you.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.400
The first page is the wireframe,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.320
and you can use this to quickly check what you're doing.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.320
The second page is for colors,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.385
and I'll show you how to edit this once we get to the next lesson.

00:09:43.385 --> 00:09:46.310
Third page is for typography,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:53.765
and I went ahead and created these frames for you so you know what you need to fill in,

00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:57.510
and then we have one page for the main design.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:02.765
This is where we'll create the actual design for the landing page.

00:10:02.765 --> 00:10:08.995
Go ahead and open this file and you can start working directly in it.

00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:13.200
Now the fourth and final step is actually optional,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.215
you can download Figma for the desktop.

00:10:17.215 --> 00:10:18.340
As you can see right now,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.360
I have Figma opened in the browser and you can work like this,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.460
no problem, the result is exactly the same.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.555
But if it's more comfortable for you,

00:10:28.555 --> 00:10:32.135
you can download Figma for desktop.

00:10:32.135 --> 00:10:38.720
You can do that by going to figma.com/downloads and under Desktop App,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.480
choose the one that you want for Mac OS or Windows.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.140
After you do all of this,

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.110
you're ready to go.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.560
Now, you might be asking me, Adi,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.140
why this project, why a landing page?

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.235
The answer to that is very simple.

00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:01.165
For this class, I wanted you to learn,

00:11:01.165 --> 00:11:03.255
number 1, how to work in Figma,

00:11:03.255 --> 00:11:10.340
and number 2, the process of going from a client request to a finished product.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.575
A landing page is pretty simple.

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:16.940
It's just one page,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:23.310
you don't have to worry about complex elements that you would normally find on a website,

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:28.530
and it's quick and easy to do.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.805
I wanted this project to resemble a real life scenario.

00:11:34.805 --> 00:11:37.330
You start from a project brief,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.185
you start from a set of wireframes,

00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:43.270
these are things that you would normally get

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:49.325
or you would normally use when you're interacting with your client.

00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:56.335
The clients gives you all the information you need in the project brief,

00:11:56.335 --> 00:11:57.885
and based on that,

00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:01.640
you build the wireframe and based on the wireframe,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.285
you design the actual page.

00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:15.100
This is as close to a real life project that you can get in a class like this.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.065
Hopefully, you'll be able to use the information you learned

00:12:20.065 --> 00:12:25.270
here and apply it in future projects.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.205
Now, as you're taking this class,

00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:34.470
I strongly encourage you to post your results in the project gallery.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.970
I want to see your result.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.280
I want to see the projects that you're making.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:47.585
As I was saying, I would like you to experiment and to add your own spin on things.

00:12:47.585 --> 00:12:51.305
It's totally fine if you follow exactly what I do,

00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:52.940
go ahead and post that.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.375
But if you want,

00:12:56.375 --> 00:13:00.965
just feel free to add your own colors,

00:13:00.965 --> 00:13:04.210
your own typefaces, let me see

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:09.835
your own vision for creating this landing page based on that wireframe.

00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:12.120
So go ahead and post that in

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.715
the project gallery and I will give you feedback for it if you want.

00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:19.225
I would just love to see your results.

00:13:19.225 --> 00:13:24.690
Also post in the discussion tab if you have any questions or comments,

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.600
it doesn't matter how simple you think they might be,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.925
if there's something you want to ask me, go ahead and do that.

00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:38.230
I'll answer to each and every one of your questions.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.960
All right. Here's what you need to do at this point.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.740
Go ahead and set up,

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.640
like I showed you previously.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.400
Download the starter kits,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.895
create a Figma account,

00:14:00.895 --> 00:14:07.805
open the starter Figma file and also optionally install Figma on your computer.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:12.725
Once you do that, you'll be good to go for the main lessons.

00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:15.190
In the first main lesson,

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.495
will be the finding the color scheme.

00:14:18.495 --> 00:14:22.585
I am going to show you a few tools that will help you with that.

00:14:22.585 --> 00:14:25.200
That's coming up next.
