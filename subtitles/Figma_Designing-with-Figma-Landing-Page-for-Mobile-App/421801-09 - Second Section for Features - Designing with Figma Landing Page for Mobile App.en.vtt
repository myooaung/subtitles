00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.750
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.925
In this lesson, we're going to design

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.440
the second set of features or the second section for features,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.685
whatever you want to call it and we'll do it in a different way than the first one.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:27.015
Now, when you're designing a landing page like this or any kind of presentation website,

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:36.090
it's very important to vary the way you are displaying these features,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.320
and if you do that,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.760
you make sure you're keeping the user's interests alive.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.565
Imagine having to display 30 features in a page.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:58.025
Now if you take those 30 features and you've dumped them all into a list,

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.220
for example, it's just going to be plain boring.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.945
No one's going to read through that.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:05.795
Instead, if you take ten of them,

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:09.170
you display them maybe in a grid with some icons like we

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.770
did and then you take the other ten or another ten and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.110
you display them further down the page in a different way and then you

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.565
take the last ten and display them even further down the page,

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:25.370
maybe with some accompanying images or illustrations.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.580
Well, that is a much better approach because it's going to keep

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.515
the user engaged and the user is going to digest that content much easier.

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:41.660
So in this lesson,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.000
we're going to use a different layout for the second set of features. Let's begin.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.745
Let's take a look at the wireframe to see exactly what we need to do.

00:01:55.745 --> 00:02:01.970
So we have this feature category with

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.360
this description and then four features.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.725
Now in the wireframe,

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:14.030
I added this black box as a placeholder for an image.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.545
We can use an image here or we can simply use the text.

00:02:20.545 --> 00:02:23.010
It's really up to us.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.210
So here's what we're going to do.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.355
We're going to copy all of these,

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.510
all the text that is,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.060
and we're going to paste it in our main design like so.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.915
But actually before we do that,

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:43.740
let's do a little bit of clean up.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.350
I think it's really important that we work as cleanly as possible.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.595
So let's name these features or actually features one,

00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:59.270
and then you can go ahead and rename these groups as well.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.360
I'm not going to do that here because time is of the essence

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.860
but know that whenever you're creating a design,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.830
name your layers and groups

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.630
accordingly because it's just going to make your life much easier.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.750
Alright. So now, there are a couple of

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.425
common elements that these two sets of features share.

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:28.020
So we're also going to add a subtitle like so.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.655
So let me just bring that down.

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:36.515
The subtitle for this section is,

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:40.615
if I remember correctly, iOS magic.

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:46.430
Now, to save time, copy properties,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.925
paste properties, copy properties, and paste properties.

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:58.305
Cool. Now, let's make sure that

00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:07.985
this text is displayed on a maximum of five columns,

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:11.970
just like that, and this one as well and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.220
then let's select all of these shift A and select

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.865
32 pixels between them and also make sure to

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:31.805
uncheck clip content if you find some of the senders on the text here are cutoff.

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:40.450
Cool. Make sure everything is aligned to the left and we are ready to go.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.255
Now, I'm going to take all of this and position it

00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:53.360
240 pixels from the section above and now looking at this page,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.280
I realize that I actually forgot to do something.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.100
I forgot to add a very light background to the first few sections,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.350
to the first two sections, excuse me.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.855
So let me quickly fix that.

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:17.105
I'm going to start by creating a rectangle and I'm going to position that below.

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:28.190
Let's make that bigger like that, and like that.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.000
Let's resize this so that we have a padding here on

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.115
the bottom or space between the edge and these elements of 120 pixels.

00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:51.490
Now, here's another quick tip and a very helpful keyboard shortcut.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.490
Remember when I told you about the nudging tools,

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.700
where you can use the keyboard arrows to move an element left,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.100
right, top, and bottom?

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.865
Now, if you press command on a Mac or Control on Windows,

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:14.935
you can resize an element.

00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:23.065
So, for example, if I hold down command and I press the arrow down key,

00:06:23.065 --> 00:06:26.785
and pay close attention here,

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:30.725
I can actually resize this from the keyboard,

00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:34.515
and if I also hold down shift,

00:06:34.515 --> 00:06:38.230
I can resize it even faster.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.450
The same goes for width.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:49.320
So Command or Control and then left and right arrows allows me

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.630
to change the width of an element and again,

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.765
if I hold down shift,

00:06:56.765 --> 00:07:01.940
I can change these values in increments of ten compared to increments of

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.265
one with just the command or control key pressed.

00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:14.940
So that's how you can resize an element using your keyboard.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.255
So back to this bit.

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:23.555
We need to resize this so that we have 120 pixels of padding on the bottom,

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:29.025
just like that and now let's use a nice background color.

00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:31.755
I could use a gray,

00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:33.390
a very light gray,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:40.020
maybe gray ten from here or I can use the primary ten.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.510
So let's do that.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:50.450
So primary 10 percent and If I think that's a little bit too much,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.660
I can go even lower 5 percent and I think,

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.890
actually, that's the value that I'm going to keep it at,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.825
5 percent and this creates

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:08.945
a nice separation between this section here and this section here.

00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:15.200
So now let's select all of these and let's push them down again until

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:21.780
we get to 240 percent from this top element.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.235
Cool. Now let's style these elements.

00:08:26.235 --> 00:08:28.145
For all of these,

00:08:28.145 --> 00:08:32.390
we're going to be using the following styles,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:39.460
Brandon Grotesque, regular, and I'm going to use the exact same style that we have here.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:46.715
So copy paste, copy properties, paste properties.

00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:52.610
The only difference is I'm going to use 80 percent on the color

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:58.915
instead of 60 percent and also let's fix the capitalization here.

00:08:58.915 --> 00:09:07.550
So now, what I'm going to do is create card elements from these text elements.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.890
Really easy to do that, select an element,

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.085
shift A to add auto-layout,

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:18.710
and then select vertical 32,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:26.255
horizontal padding 64, vertical padding 0 here.

00:09:26.255 --> 00:09:31.710
We can add a fill as white and we can also add a drop shadow.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.385
So the drop shadow is going to be like this,

00:09:34.385 --> 00:09:39.405
30 for blur, 0 x, 20 y,

00:09:39.405 --> 00:09:44.340
and then we're going to use this color,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:52.305
our main gray 25 percent as the shadow color and also,

00:09:52.305 --> 00:09:55.979
let's add a border-radius of eight pixels.

00:09:55.979 --> 00:10:01.565
Now what I can do is I can set the text to align to the center,

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:07.130
and I can resize this so that it

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:13.675
spans three columns and also,

00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:22.190
we're going to resize this one until we get to the desired padding here on the left.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:27.655
Alright, so now it's just rinse and repeat for the other two elements.

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:32.870
So let's select all of them and align them to the center.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:41.430
Let's set their width to 216 pixels and then we'll do shift A, shift A,

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.330
shift A, select this frame,

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:52.950
copy properties, select these frames, paste properties.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:11:02.895
Pretty cool, right? Now, let's align these with our text.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:07.770
We're going to use a spacing of 64 between these elements,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.080
and let's position them like so.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:31.135
I'm going to use 32 pixels of spacing between these elements.

00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:33.849
Now that we see all of them together,

00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:36.880
we notice that this one is smaller than the rest.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.405
We need to set a fixed width for it.

00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:43.180
Since we have auto layout added,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.380
we need to switch the orientation to vertical so that we can

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:52.240
then select fixed width instead of auto width.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:12:00.000
Like so. Now I can resize this to any value I need.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.640
To make this a little bit more interesting,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.805
I'm going to select both of these and I'm going to push them down 32 pixels.

00:12:08.805 --> 00:12:15.895
Holding down Shift and pressing the down arrow key,

00:12:15.895 --> 00:12:20.635
1, 2, 3, I let go of Shift 1, 2.

00:12:20.635 --> 00:12:27.070
Now I have a 32 pixel gap from the top of this to the that the top of this.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.590
Now we can go ahead and group these up.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:35.990
We can go ahead and Shift A on this.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.360
Make sure to uncheck Clip content.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.440
This part is now done.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.315
To make this section a bit more interesting,

00:12:49.315 --> 00:12:51.985
we'll do two more things.

00:12:51.985 --> 00:12:54.985
One, is we're going to add some imagery.

00:12:54.985 --> 00:12:58.720
For that, I'm actually going to move

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:06.025
this entire section to the right and I'm going to go back to my starter kit,

00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:08.785
I'm going to select the Placeholder images and

00:13:08.785 --> 00:13:12.295
I'm going to select the iPad Pro and the iPhone 7.

00:13:12.295 --> 00:13:16.765
Drag and drop into my page.

00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:19.600
These are a little bit too big right now,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.580
so let's resize them.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.530
I'm going to resize this to about, I don't know, 700,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:32.620
and then I'm going to resize this phone to about half that value, to 350.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.590
I don't know the exact ratio

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:42.235
between these two elements but at a glance this looks about right.

00:13:42.235 --> 00:13:44.770
What I'm going to do now is,

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:51.410
put the iPhone on top of the iPad so they look something like this.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.430
Then I'm going to push this down, 10,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.435
20, 30, 1, 2, so 32 pixels.

00:14:01.435 --> 00:14:03.835
I'm going to select both of these,

00:14:03.835 --> 00:14:07.570
Command G to group them and then I'm going to

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.025
align the edge of the iPhone with the edge of this column.

00:14:12.025 --> 00:14:16.930
The idea is to leave this column here blank.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.735
I'll select these two,

00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:24.470
select this, align top.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.530
Finally, the last thing I want to do is select

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:35.785
this image of the iPad and add drop shadow.

00:14:35.785 --> 00:14:39.140
Select the iPhone and do the same.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.605
This just creates a little bit of depth.

00:14:44.605 --> 00:14:47.980
Pretty cool. Now finally,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:53.330
what I want to do is add some stripes here.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.050
If you're wondering how I got the inspiration for

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:04.180
this design with the angles and stuff, well,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:12.220
I had a look at the project brief where the client told us that,

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:18.475
hey, here are a few websites that we like and one of them is Stripe.

00:15:18.475 --> 00:15:22.420
If you haven't seen the Stripe website,

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.865
well, it's very cool.

00:15:24.865 --> 00:15:27.820
It looks something like this.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.830
You can see that I got a lot of inspiration from here with the bold colors,

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:39.445
with the angles, with how this image section here is presented.

00:15:39.445 --> 00:15:47.440
Because I started using this diagonal or this angled approach,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:55.300
I'm going to use it in the rest of the page.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:03.280
I'm going to start by creating a rectangle about this big.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.780
I'm going to set its rotation to 16 degrees.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.935
Then I'm going to position it somewhere around here so that it

00:16:11.935 --> 00:16:17.330
passes just through the list of features.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:24.380
I'm going to bring it under this frame, like so.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.495
I'm going to add a gradient to it.

00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:30.895
To add a gradient,

00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:33.070
we can do it in two different ways.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.140
We can select it, go to fill,

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.540
select Linear, Radial, an Angular,

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:45.310
a Diamond gradient, whatever but linear is usually what you would go for.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:51.800
Then pick the colors manually.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:57.670
I actually have a great resource for you and that's called WebGradients.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.075
You can find it at webgradients.com.

00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:08.020
It basically shows you a list of premade gradients. Pretty cool, right?

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:16.450
You can see the start and finish colors and you can even copy CSS code for it.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:26.365
What's nice about this website is that it also offers a plug-in for Figma.

00:17:26.365 --> 00:17:30.010
That plugin is called WebGradients.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:34.150
Go ahead and install it just like any other plug-in.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.450
All you have to do is select the shape that you want to use

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.960
the gradient on and then click on this list.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:49.550
The plug-in automatically fills in the gradient for you. How cool is that?

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.080
It's really up to your preference,

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.240
what kind of gradients you want to use here.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.435
I'm going to choose this one, Rainy Ashville.

00:17:58.435 --> 00:18:01.420
I'm going to position this here for now.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.730
I'm going to change its layer opacity to 10 percent.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.770
I'm doing that because I'm going to add another gradient.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:17.620
I'm going to change its angle to maybe 12 degrees.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.580
Move it up, something like this.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.415
For that I'm going to use a darker gradient,

00:18:24.415 --> 00:18:28.855
maybe something with different colors. Something like that.

00:18:28.855 --> 00:18:33.080
You can play around with the opacity on this one.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.720
Let's go a little bit higher, 20 percent.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.000
Let's go with 20 percent on this one as well.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:48.430
It's just a detail or these two stripes,

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.970
but I think they make all the difference.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:58.000
They look just fabulous with the rest of the elements.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.110
Then select everything, Command G to group everything up,

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:10.310
and we'll call these Features 2.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.070
The second section for features is done.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.940
Now it's your turn to put your own spin on it.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.670
You can do that in so many different ways.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.180
You can use different gradients for those two stripes.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.305
You can swap the image with the written content.

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:46.090
You can use a different style for those white cards.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.280
It can do lots of things.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.205
Go ahead and experiment and make sure to post

00:19:51.205 --> 00:19:56.635
your project in the project gallery so we can all have a look.

00:19:56.635 --> 00:20:02.530
With that said, we are now ready to move on to the next section.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.960
After a quick glance over the wire-frame,

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.135
we can see that that section is a small cold action.

00:20:10.135 --> 00:20:14.210
We'll do that in the next lesson. I'll see you there.
