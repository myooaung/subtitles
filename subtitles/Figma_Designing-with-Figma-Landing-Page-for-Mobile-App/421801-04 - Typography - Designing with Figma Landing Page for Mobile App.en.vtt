00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.690
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.195
In this lesson, we're going to tackle the typography for our learning page.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:13.620
Now, what does that mean?

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.360
Well, it means choosing the right typefaces and all of

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.720
the other text properties to make sure that everything looks nice and neat.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.520
That means font sizes,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.055
line heights, font weights,

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:30.990
and so on and so forth.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.910
I'm also going to be showing you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.645
some very helpful tools that are going to make your job a lot easier,

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:43.530
and we'll also discuss typographic scales,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830
and I'm going to give you an introduction to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.715
the eight point grid system we'll be using throughout this design process.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:58.085
Let's begin. We begin

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:05.215
here in the starter Figma file under Typography,

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:10.130
where I've created a few frames, for defining typefaces,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.995
the type scale, the heading styles,

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:16.330
the style for the block quotes, and the paragraphs.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.620
This is enough to get you going.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.685
Let's move on to defining the headings.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:30.120
To do that, we'll start by taking a look at the project brief.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.860
Right at the end, under design considerations,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:42.470
the client asks us to make the landing page modern, professional, yet playful.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.070
How does that translate to the typography?

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.630
Well, the playful part,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.105
we can actually get from the colors.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.205
When we make it colorful,

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:56.905
we make it playful.

00:01:56.905 --> 00:02:00.975
But this bit, make it modern and professional.

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:05.375
We can totally do that with the help of typography.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.865
When starting a project like this,

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:15.245
it's always a good idea to visit the websites that you use to get your font files.

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:16.700
There are a lot of them.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.515
I use two of them,

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:22.535
mainly Adobe Fonts and Google Fonts.

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:27.450
Now, Google Fonts is free and Adobe Fonts,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.155
well, you need to have an Adobe subscription to get access to these.

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:35.360
But I will say this,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.680
Adobe has much higher quality typefaces than Google.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.085
You can still find great typefaces here,

00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:47.630
but usually I reach out for Adobe Fonts,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.675
because they just are a little bit more refined,

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:57.700
and the collection here is actually much bigger than what you would find on Google Fonts.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.860
Because I have an Adobe subscription,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.300
it just makes sense for me to use their fonts.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.520
Now, because the client asked us to make the landing page look modern,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.690
we're going to use a sans serif typeface.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.270
What is a sans serif typeface?

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.870
Well, let me give you an example.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.620
I'm going to open up Roboto here.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.530
Actually, I'm just going to make this really big so you can see the difference.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.380
A sans serif is a typeface that doesn't have the serifs on the letters.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.870
I think actually I should start with a serif typeface,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.430
so you can see the difference.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.320
This is a Serif typeface.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.640
See these decorations here,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.060
and also here, and also here?

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.605
These are called serifs.

00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:08.310
Serifs are usually found on older typefaces.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:17.570
The more modern typefaces are sans serif or without serif.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.760
Just like this one. See here,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.475
we don't have those decorations anymore.

00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:29.215
We can't find them here or here or here.

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:33.230
These are cleaner and more modern.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.000
Now, I won't go over serif versus sans serif in this class,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.575
that's beyond the scope.

00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:45.380
But if at some point a client asks you,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.230
"Okay, we want a modern looking website."

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.545
Then as far as typography is concerned,

00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:55.685
you need to use sans serif typefaces.

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:57.170
Now, in my case,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.045
after doing a little bit of digging around on Adobe Fonts,

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:06.420
I've settled for Brandon Grotesque.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.115
This is a typeface that fits both criteria,

00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:13.535
it's modern, it's sans serif,

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:17.170
and it's also very professional looking,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.230
and it also has all of these styles.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:29.620
We have styles or weights ranging from thin to light to regular to black.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.384
This is the one that we're going to use for the headings and some of the other elements.

00:05:36.384 --> 00:05:40.720
Now, when it comes to the body text,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.195
we're going to be using Tisa Sans Pro or FF Tisa Sans as it's called

00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:52.105
here.This is a typeface that's similar to Brandon Grotesque,

00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:55.615
but obviously it has its own differences.

00:05:55.615 --> 00:06:03.680
I'm using two typefaces because while Brandon Grotesque is great for headings,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.830
so it's great and large font sizes.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.520
It doesn't do that well on smaller body text.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.960
For that reason I'm using FF Tisa Sans or Tisa Sans Pro.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.675
This will work great on smaller text sizes like for example 18,

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.670
when we're doing the body text,

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.640
this will perform beautifully.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.890
Now, these are my choices.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.240
Your choices might vary and I strongly suggest

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.445
you do a little bit of digging around either on Adobe Fonts or Google Fonts,

00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:45.724
and find the typeface that you think look best,

00:06:45.724 --> 00:06:48.080
and go ahead and use those.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.625
In my case, I have both of these fonts installed on my system.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:59.400
All I got to do now is go in here in Figma and reference them.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.850
I'm going to say Brandon Grotesque,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.700
and I'm going to go right here under text,

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.205
and I'm going to select Brandon Grotesque.

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:11.100
Let's make this bold,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.535
and let's use a bigger font size, maybe like 55.

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.125
What I usually do,

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:20.480
and let me just move these out of the way.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.835
I usually duplicate these values and I just highlight

00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:32.600
or present all the weights for this typeface.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.470
This is regular, this is medium,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.090
bold, and this is black.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.280
This just gives me an idea of how the typeface

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.670
looks like without having to change a piece of text manually.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.980
For example, if I'm in main design,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.160
I can just come into typography and I can say, okay,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.500
so this is what the lightest version of it looks like,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.180
or this is how the heaviest version of it looks like.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.460
Let's go ahead and do the same for the body texts,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.800
we're using Tisa Sans Pro,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.440
and I'm going to do exactly the same here.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.390
This has a couple of versions as well.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.820
Starting from thin, light,

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.405
or actually these are impaired way around,

00:08:21.405 --> 00:08:24.190
regular and then medium,

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.630
bold, extra bold, and black.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.010
All right. So now we have our typefaces ready to go.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.365
By the way, to zoom in like this,

00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:44.510
you can hold command on Mac and just use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:51.740
or on Windows, you can use control and the mouse wheel to do the same thing.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.010
Since we're on the topic of zooming in and out,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:00.270
let me show you two other keyboard shortcuts I use all the time.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.445
Shift zero will always zoom to 100 percent,

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:09.240
regardless of Mac or Windows.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.750
Shift 1 will zoom to fit,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.130
so it's going to take all of your frames and it's going to

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.395
fit them in the visible portion of your canvas.

00:09:20.395 --> 00:09:27.700
If you select an element or a frame and you press Shift 2,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.475
it's going to zoom to selection.

00:09:30.475 --> 00:09:36.285
These are three keyboard shortcuts that I use all the time.

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:41.070
Again, Shift 0 will zoom to 100 percent,

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.840
Shift 1 zoom to fit,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.720
Shift 2 zoom to selection.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.770
Holding down the Command on Mac or control on Windows will

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:58.095
basically allow you to use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:05.680
Pretty cool. Now, let's move on to the type scale.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.635
Now, what is a typographic scale?

00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:14.950
Well, the easiest way to explain is to show you.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.570
Here we have a website that I use all the time it's called types-cale.com,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:25.000
and here what you do is basically you set your base font size.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.770
You select a scale and that will give you a list of

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:35.335
font sizes that you need to use to create this harmonious scale.

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:39.925
If I were to change the ratio here,

00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:43.195
you will see that the scale changes as well.

00:10:43.195 --> 00:10:44.470
By using this tool,

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.730
you can say, "Okay,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.015
this is what I'm going to use for heading one,

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:54.040
heading two, three, four, five and six.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.205
This is what I use for smaller text.

00:10:57.205 --> 00:10:59.650
By using this tool,

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:05.500
I make sure that my typography is always spot on because without it,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:12.430
you don't really know what kind of font sizes to use.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.725
I mean, you start with,

00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:19.210
let's say the base font size for the body text,

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.490
which is usually 16 pixels.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.070
But what about after that?

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.145
What do you use for the H1 or the H3?

00:11:29.145 --> 00:11:30.780
Do you use 20 pixels,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.700
or do you use 21 pixels?

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.280
Or maybe you use whatever you think looks best?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:45.595
That can work but having a tool like this that tells you exactly what kind of,

00:11:45.595 --> 00:11:51.970
or what font sizes to use based on a scale is critical.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.405
The way this works is actually very simple.

00:11:55.405 --> 00:12:01.825
Let me open a calculator and explain the principle behind this.

00:12:01.825 --> 00:12:06.805
Type scale base works based on a ratio.

00:12:06.805 --> 00:12:09.340
We start with the base value,

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.650
which is 16 pixels.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:15.280
That base value, we multiply by the scale,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.435
which in our case is 1.414,

00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:26.205
and that gives us the result, 22.624.

00:12:26.205 --> 00:12:28.620
Now for the next item on the scale,

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:35.380
we take that value, 22.624 or 22.62.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.850
We can use two decimal places and we divide it,

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.220
or we multiply it with the same ratio,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:48.280
1.414 and that will give us the next value.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.160
In our case, I actually used the wrong separator here.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.190
In our case it's 31.98 and you do that over and over and over

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:06.880
again until you get all the values for the rest of your text elements.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.020
Now, the advantage of using a tool like

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.010
Type Scale is that you don't have to make these calculations manually.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:21.340
It does it for you, and it does it in M's as well as in pixels.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.424
Now because I'm using Figma,

00:13:23.424 --> 00:13:27.640
I have a handy plugin that generates type scales

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.840
for me and that plugin is called Font Scale.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.460
If you want to install it,

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.175
you simply need to go to Plugins,

00:13:36.175 --> 00:13:42.940
Manage Plugin, and then search for Font Scale and install it.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.950
It's really, really simple.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.290
Now to use this Plugin,

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.420
you enter the base font sizes,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.910
in my case is going to be 18 and choose the scale factor in my case

00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:01.330
is going to be major third and then, generate layers.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:07.945
That generated these layers and it can actually paste them in here.

00:14:07.945 --> 00:14:17.035
As you can see, that gives you text elements that have the correct font sizes.

00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:20.950
It's exactly the same as going here and saying, "Okay,

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:26.650
I want to use 18 pixels and 1.250 or major third."

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:31.090
That's going to give you the exact same result, the difference is,

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:38.480
in Figma you have these layers and you can reference them at anytime you want.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:43.074
Let's select all of these and let's change

00:14:43.074 --> 00:14:48.250
the typeface to Brandon Grotesque, there we go.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:54.250
Now, I'm also going to add another element here because I

00:14:54.250 --> 00:15:01.810
want this final value of 55 pixels.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.840
Now what I'm going to do, I'm going to go through

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.125
each one and I'm going to round off the font size.

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:15.340
This is 43.95, we're going to make it 44,

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:24.325
this is 35, this is 28, this is 22.5.

00:15:24.325 --> 00:15:30.060
I can go either 22 or 23. Let's go with 23.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.865
This is 18, and this is 14.4 but we're going to use 14.

00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:39.665
Now since we have the typographic scale in place,

00:15:39.665 --> 00:15:44.200
let's do a little bit of a simulation for the heading styles.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.450
We're going to say heading one and then,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:52.375
we're going to multiply that to create headings from one through six.

00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:57.040
Also let's do a small element here.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:05.710
All of these will be using Brandon Grotesque and headings one through three,

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.375
we're going to make them bold.

00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:11.905
Heading five, we're probably going to make this medium.

00:16:11.905 --> 00:16:18.505
Heading six is going to be regular and the small will use uppercase.

00:16:18.505 --> 00:16:24.850
You can open these advanced type details by clicking

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:34.570
this little button here and choosing uppercase and this will be set to 14 pixels.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.914
Let's do 5 percent letter spacing,

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:43.705
it's going to be bold and we should be good to go there.

00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:49.915
Now, let's define the styles or the style for the other headings.

00:16:49.915 --> 00:16:52.390
We have heading one.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.515
That's going to be 55 pixels,

00:16:56.515 --> 00:17:04.000
because 55 is the font size of this element from our Type Scale.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.300
Heading two, we'll be using 44,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.140
Heading three, we'll be using 35.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.205
Then we'll have 28 for heading four,

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:21.310
23 for heading five and then for heading six,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.975
we'll be using 18,

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:25.150
which is the base font size.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.845
By doing this, we basically find the font sizes for

00:17:29.845 --> 00:17:35.365
all our headings based on this type scale.

00:17:35.365 --> 00:17:39.430
Pretty cool and very, very easy.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.080
Let's go ahead and move this.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.425
Since we're on the topic of defining styles,

00:17:47.425 --> 00:17:52.480
let's define a style for the block quotes and here we'll be using also

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:59.440
Brandon Grotesque and we're going to be using the 35 pixel font size.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.980
Let's move that out of the way and finally,

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.625
let's set a style for the paragraphs.

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:14.110
These will be using Tisa Sans Pro, regular, 18 pixels.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:20.950
Now, our typography is pretty much set up.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:26.785
The final thing that we have to do is set the proper line heights.

00:18:26.785 --> 00:18:28.315
Now, to do that,

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:32.695
we're going to be working with the eight point grid system.

00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:35.890
Let me tell you a little bit about this.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:42.355
There's a great article that I linked in the resources, P-D-F file.

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:43.810
Go ahead and check that out.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:49.420
It really explains why it's beneficial to use the eight point grid system in web design.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:58.405
Essentially, what we're trying to do is achieve a consistent vertical rhythm.

00:18:58.405 --> 00:19:03.265
So any measurement or any distance,

00:19:03.265 --> 00:19:06.940
any margin or padding that we're going to apply,

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:13.285
any height that we're going to apply to our elements should be a multiple of eight.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:19.885
That applies to the text elements as well.

00:19:19.885 --> 00:19:25.465
The font size doesn't necessarily have to be a multiple of eight.

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:31.675
What matters is the line height is a multiple of eight because the line height

00:19:31.675 --> 00:19:38.665
dictates how tall the lines of text are and if there are multiples of eight,

00:19:38.665 --> 00:19:43.840
then everything is going to fall nicely on a baseline grid.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.370
I'm going to show you a little bit about that when we add

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:54.280
more elements and we follow this eight point grid system.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.915
But for now what you should know is that when it comes to typography,

00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:06.580
we're going to set the line height of the text elements to be a multiple of eight.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.055
Let's go ahead and do that right now.

00:20:09.055 --> 00:20:15.940
Heading one has a line height that should be around 79 pixels.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.430
This is automatically calculated by Figma,

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.415
so I'm going to set it to 80 pixels.

00:20:21.415 --> 00:20:25.270
Heading two should be around 63,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:31.195
or the next, or the closest multiple of eight is 64. So we'll do that.

00:20:31.195 --> 00:20:34.285
Heading three is 50.

00:20:34.285 --> 00:20:38.710
Here, we can go either 48,

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.825
that's a multiple of eight,

00:20:40.825 --> 00:20:43.855
or we can go with 56.

00:20:43.855 --> 00:20:46.000
Let's do that to 56.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.045
Heading four is 40,

00:20:49.045 --> 00:20:51.070
so that's spot on.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:58.300
Heading five is 36 and we can go with either 40 or 32.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.025
So let's go 32.

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:02.365
Heading six is 18.

00:21:02.365 --> 00:21:06.010
We can go 24 here and this one,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.245
we can go 24 as well.

00:21:08.245 --> 00:21:11.485
That's the line height set for the headings.

00:21:11.485 --> 00:21:15.100
Now, for the block quotes, let's see 35,

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:22.225
we're going to use 56 because that's what we used here as well.

00:21:22.225 --> 00:21:29.425
But if you feel like this is too much and now that I actually see it,

00:21:29.425 --> 00:21:32.575
I might just revert back to 48.

00:21:32.575 --> 00:21:36.175
I think that looks a little bit better.

00:21:36.175 --> 00:21:39.755
So let's do that here as well, 48.

00:21:39.755 --> 00:21:42.300
By the way, these are not final,

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.580
we can always change these,

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:52.030
if you get to the design point and you find that this doesn't really work that well.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:56.410
You can always come back to this and change. It's not a big deal.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:03.990
Paragraphs 18, we're going to use 24 as a line height and with that,

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:11.050
we've created the typography characteristics for our landing page.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.130
Alright, if you've been working alongside me,

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.440
then you should have the typography all figured out.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.635
If not, go ahead and do that right now and just like with colors,

00:22:35.635 --> 00:22:37.750
experiment a little bit,

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:43.880
you don't have to use the same typefaces that I use or the same scale that I did.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:48.970
Pick a typeface or pick the two typefaces that you think

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:54.670
work best for this kind of product or for this kind of project.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:23:00.145
It doesn't matter if it's a free or a paid typeface.

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:01.855
If you think it looks good,

00:23:01.855 --> 00:23:03.220
go ahead and use it.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:13.495
Also, you don't have to use the same 1.25 scale that I used.

00:23:13.495 --> 00:23:15.490
Play around with them.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:23.500
Pick one that you think looks best and when choosing the different ratios,

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:32.620
notice how these affect the overall composition of those texts elements.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.955
See how this changes the visual hierarchy.

00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:42.745
In the page, you will see that the lower the ratio,

00:23:42.745 --> 00:23:47.665
the less difference it is between each step in the scale.

00:23:47.665 --> 00:23:50.095
The higher the ratio,

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:54.865
the higher the difference between each step in the scale.

00:23:54.865 --> 00:23:59.200
For example, if you're going with a golden ratio,

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.135
you'll see that there is a dramatic difference

00:24:04.135 --> 00:24:10.195
between the smaller font sizes and the larger font sizes.

00:24:10.195 --> 00:24:19.075
Each type scale, each ratio has its place for different things.

00:24:19.075 --> 00:24:25.960
You would use smaller ratios for blogs maybe,

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:32.890
or for maybe a dashboard where you don't need such a big difference

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:37.270
between font sizes and you would use something like

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.889
the golden ratio when you want to make a statement,

00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:47.240
when you have a website with big bold typography.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:55.240
When you have a big difference between the body text and the largest heading.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.805
So play around with these,

00:24:57.805 --> 00:24:59.560
and once you're done,

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.990
you're ready to move on to the next lesson,

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:08.500
which is about images and other visual assets like icons.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:14.500
Now, we're going to be using some placeholder images and even though these are not final,

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.515
at least, they give us a starting point.

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:21.410
That's coming up in the next lesson. I'll see you there.
