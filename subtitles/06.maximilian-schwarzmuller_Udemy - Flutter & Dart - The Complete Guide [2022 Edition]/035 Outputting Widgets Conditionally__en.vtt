00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.670
Now let's start with the ternary expression and therefore here, you first of all have your condition.

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.780
The condition here could be without the if keyword,

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.060
that's how you'll write a ternary expression.

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.610
So the condition here can be the same condition as up there,

5
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.170
is the question index smaller than the question length? If this is the case, then you add a question mark,

6
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.690
this will then mark the border to the code which should run if this is true.

7
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.340
So the thing after the question mark is used

8
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.590
if this condition is true and then you need to add a colon after the code block that should be used

9
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.530
if this is true

10
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.790
and this part after the question mark must only be one expression, here since it's a lot of lines, it

11
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.490
looks like it's more than one expression but in the end, it's only the column here,

12
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.970
right?

13
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.530
It's only the column, all the other stuff is in the column.

14
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.300
So only the column here is created

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.040
if that is true and therefore after the column down there, we add a colon

16
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.300
and now we have the so-called else block.

17
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.310
We didn't have an else block up there but we could add it here as well,

18
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.180
you can add else here and then you can define code that should run if the condition is not met,

19
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.690
so if this here, if this returns false, then you will go into the else block. By the way in if statements

20
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.580
like this here,

21
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.380
you can also have else if statements where you could add other conditions which are checked if the first

22
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.790
condition is not met but let's ignore that for now. For the ternary expression here down in our body,

23
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.430
we don't have else if but we do have our main code,

24
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.900
if the condition is met and then after the colon, we have our else block

25
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.750
and now that could be a center widget which is another widget baked into Flutter that centers all

26
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.990
the content horizontally and vertically on the page.

27
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.290
It takes a child and that is then the widget which should be centered

28
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.010
and this could simply be some text like you did it and let's add a trailing comma here, reformat everything

29
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.470
and now we have a ternary expression. If we now reload this application and we go back,

30
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.720
now I can select my answers but after the third button click, we don't get the error but we get

31
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.500
you did it

32
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.280
and that's of course way nicer and already a better user experience.
