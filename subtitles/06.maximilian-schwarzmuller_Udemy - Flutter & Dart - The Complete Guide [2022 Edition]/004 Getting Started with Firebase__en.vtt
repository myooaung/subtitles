1
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.260
You can visit firebase dot Google dot com to create new firebase projects and also to learn more about

2
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.790
Firebase.

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.470
Now Firebase is a service by Google and it consists of a lot of different products.

4
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.540
As you can see, if you click on products, a lot of features built in will see some of those features.

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.170
We'll see those most important features, so to say, in action here.

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.490
And if you click on pricing, you will see that you can start for free.

7
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.750
But depending on which features you're going to use, you might need a paid plan, which also initially

8
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.560
is free.

9
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.820
But where you can Okura costs if you then use certain services to a certain extent.

10
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.340
And you can see all the details here in the pricing page there you'll learn what's free and what costs

11
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.760
money.

12
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.250
And if there is any free tier, for example, for authentication, you see that some services cost money,

13
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.970
but you also have a certain free tier so you can use them for free.

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.319
And only if you exceed this you pay basically.

15
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.650
And that's true for all those services.

16
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.910
There are certain free tiers and from a certain point on, you are going to pay and you should definitely

17
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.320
check this pricing page before you build any real app there for it.

18
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.420
Now, what we're going to do in this module should be covered by the free tier.

19
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.650
But of course, if you are already using some other firebase projects altogether, they might be exceeding

20
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.910
those free tiers.

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.460
So therefore, you should definitely check your usage and make sure that you don't occur any unexpected

22
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.150
costs.

23
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.290
With that, let's go to the firebase console.

24
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.660
And for that you will need a Google account.

25
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.190
So make sure that you do create one or that you sign in with your existing one.

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.880
Now, once you logged in, you can add a new project, and first of all, you need to pick a name here

27
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.110
and I will name it Flutter Chat, but the name is totally up to you next click continue.

28
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.139
And here you can choose if you want to add Google Analytics to your project and I will leave it turned

29
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.930
on, though technically we won't be needed here.

30
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.670
So let's click continue.

31
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.680
Select an account if you're getting prompt for.

32
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.960
Or the Google analytics account, so I did that here and I will now create that project.

33
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.230
Now, this can take a few seconds or maybe even minutes, but it should be fairly quick.

34
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.220
And this will now set up a firebase project and then forward us to a Web console where we can manage

35
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.740
that project and where you will be able to manage and monitor those different services you might be

36
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.190
using.

37
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.470
So let's wait for that to finish up.

38
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.360
Here it is.

39
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:58.240
Let's continue and here we are in this Web console now, here you see your firebase project and on the

40
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.880
left you see the different services that are offered by Firebase.

41
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.880
Now, in this module, we're going to have a look at authentication, a database and storage.

42
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.460
And we'll also have a look at the cloud functions and at push notifications, which we don't see here,

43
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.260
but which also are included.

44
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.790
You see them here with cloud messaging.

45
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.210
Now, you can manage your plan down there and switch to a paid plan, which you might need to do if

46
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.050
you exceed certain limits and you're under the gear, I and you can also manage your project and use

47
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.540
configuration data we might need and a general manager project, though we will do that together as

48
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.860
the need arises.

49
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:48.250
Now, what we need to do right away here to get started is we want to add our flutter app to this FIREBASE

50
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.500
project so that we can tap into Firebase with help of our flutter app.

51
00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.450
And for that we ever add an IOC or an Android app here, depending on which kind of app you're building.

52
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.840
Of course, you can also add both now and currently previewing this here on Android.

53
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.940
So I will click on Android here to start with that and connect my FIREBASE project here to this flutter

54
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.250
app.

55
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.459
Now we get this wizard here and I will show you in a second, by the way.

56
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.470
But let's start with that so we get this wizard.

57
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.930
And first of all, we need to enter our Android package name here.

58
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.180
Now, you see that this is the application ID you find in your built ratel file so we can go to the

59
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.910
Android folder and they're going through the app folder and there it is, built gradle file.

60
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.040
Here, it's this application I.D. which you should find in this file.

61
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.160
Now, you can also change does Project White, your flutter project and then choose any identifier of

62
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.350
your choice here, I will go for the default one.

63
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.570
You can assign a nickname if you want to, which you can see in the firebase console.

64
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.950
But I'll not do that here.

65
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.500
We don't need that signing certificate here.

66
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.830
And therefore, we can just click register app now.

67
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:18.320
Next, we should download this Google services that Jason file and then drag it into your Android app

68
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.980
folder.

69
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.370
So next to that built dot gradle file we just had a look at.

70
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.930
So let's download this.

71
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.330
And here I'm in the Android folder and in that app folder there, I will download that Google Services

72
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.480
thought Jason file.

73
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.990
Let's move on to the next step and now at the Firebase STK now for that, you should actually follow

74
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.300
the steps that are shown here.

75
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.790
Go to your project level built on gradle file, which is this one here, and make sure that you have

76
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.790
Google here in your repositories node.

77
00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.280
So here in Bill's script repositories, you should have Google and we already have that here, but verified

78
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.030
that it is their.

79
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.350
Also, under all projects, repositories, dear, you should always make sure that you have Google,

80
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.300
you can have more than that, but make sure you have Google at least.

81
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:19.180
Now, also, make sure you add this line here and you can just click that copy button near this line

82
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.430
here, Kutta dependencies in your bill script note.

83
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.180
So here's to Bill script.

84
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.800
Here are the dependencies.

85
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.820
And make sure you add this class path here, which I just copied and saved to follow thereafter.

86
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.430
Next in the app, level builds gradle file.

87
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.450
So to build gradle file in your app folder there, you should make sure that all those entries are added.

88
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.210
So under built right here.

89
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.220
If you scroll down a bit, you should already see this plug in come Android application, so that should

90
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.000
already be there.

91
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.550
But you should also add this Google Services plug in.

92
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.100
You can add it right below their.

93
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:13.400
And, of course, make sure that you have this line added to your dependencies, so if you scroll down.

94
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:23.780
Here's the penances and they're at the end, we can add this service or this line, save that file and

95
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.740
you're done, you can skip that step here.

96
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.820
You're done already.

97
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.450
So now here it's going to check whether that works.

98
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.420
But it should work, and this kennels reports that it doesn't work because you might need to uninstall

99
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.760
and reinstall Europe, but we'll see if it works soon because we're soon going to add to Flutter Firebase

100
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.600
SDK, which is going to communicate with Firebase.

101
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.980
And there we will see whether it works or not.

102
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.530
Now, that was the Android setup.

103
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.840
Now, if you develop on a Linux or Windows machine, you can now jump ahead to the next lecture.

104
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.820
But if you're on a Mac OS system, you can, of course, also configure Firebase to work with.

105
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.870
So let's do that next.

106
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.720
So therefore, I'll skip this step.

107
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.540
I'm back here in the console and I will click at app here to also add the IOC app.

108
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.110
Now, here we need to IOC bundle ID and we can find this bundle identifier in the general tap of our

109
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.900
apps, Primary, Target and Xcode as we see.

110
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:32.169
So therefore, I opened the folder of my project here with Xcode, and if I click on Runner here under

111
00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:32.890
General.

112
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.200
It's this bundle identifier which we now need.

113
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.330
And all change does actually lead to.

114
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.170
Flattr chattier.

115
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:50.780
We're actually.

116
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.360
I'll change it to the same identifier I had in the Android folder, so app built Gradle there.

117
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.690
I had.

118
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.220
This identifier, and I'll use this in Xcode to you, might already have the same if you don't maybe

119
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.470
make sure that you do have the same identifiers.

120
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.670
Now, this is the bundle identifier, which I now also add here on Firebase.

121
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:22.910
However, for us, of course, it doesn't like underscores, I keep forgetting that, so let's make

122
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:29.720
sure we remove all those underscores here so that we have this identifier and we have the same identifier

123
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.920
here on Firebase.

124
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.500
Now, Justice, before we can add a nickname if we want, you can add an abstract idea if we want to.

125
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.160
I don't want to do either of that here, so I'll just register this app.

126
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.290
And there's a next step we have to download the Google service info playlist file here.

127
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.490
So download this.

128
00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:00.300
And I'll add it in his runner folder, in my RSS project, so next to App Delegate and so on, I'll

129
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.940
add this file and save it there and now you can click next.

130
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:12.270
But because we're going to use the Flutter Firebase SDK, you should not add this firebase SDK like

131
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.240
this, so you should not follow the instructions here.

132
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.250
You should also not follow the instructions here in at initialization code.

133
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:31.470
Instead, we're already done with adding our project here and therefore we can go back and now here

134
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.600
we have our IRS project and we have our Android project set up in our FIREBASE project.

135
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.170
So we connect that this firebase project to our iOS and Android app.

136
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:46.750
And now we're going to use the Firebase Flutter SDK and get started with that in the next lecture to

137
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:53.800
finish up this connection and to be able to communicate between our flutter app and this FIREBASE backend.
