Welcome to this course, I'm extremely happy to welcome you on board in this course, you will learn,

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.010
flutter and start from scratch.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.960
No prior knowledge is required, will start at the important basics and then work our way through all

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.480
the core features up to more advanced topics like working with native devise features to flutter internal

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.850
state management and much more discourse is fully up to date.

6
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.080
And as I do it with all my courses, I will keep this course up to date and you will learn all the things

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.740
not just in theory but in the example driven project.

8
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.800
Focused Way will build multiple apps throughout this course so that you have concrete examples of how

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.690
and when to apply a certain feature.

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
And you will learn all the things by applying features on your own.

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.570
You can follow along and code along and by the end of the course you will have built multiple apps and

12
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.100
you will be well-prepared to build your own apps with the knowledge gained in this course.

13
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.710
This course also has tons of quizzes and a lot of attached documents that allow you to dive deeper and

14
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.690
check your knowledge.

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.830
Now, in addition, you get Q&A support in case you should get stuck, and therefore I'm convinced the

16
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.910
discourse will turn you into a real flutter developer.

17
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.500
Now, who am I?

18
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.730
My name is Maximum Schwartzmann and I'm a five star rated instructor here on YouTube.

19
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.850
I got multiple best selling courses and discourse here.

20
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750
All is the best selling flavor course and I'm super excited about Fleder.

21
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.660
I'm working with it since it's early alpha days, which actually already are a couple of years ago.

22
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.060
And I enjoy working with Flutter.

23
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.120
It's an amazing technology which allows you to build amazing mobile apps and I can't wait to dive into

24
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.050
that together with you.

25
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.890
So I guess let's get started and let's dive into the most important question.

26
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.930
What exactly is Flattr?
