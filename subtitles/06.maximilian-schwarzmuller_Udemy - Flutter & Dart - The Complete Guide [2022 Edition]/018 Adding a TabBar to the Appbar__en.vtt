1
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:09.550
So in this application, we can navigate around a bit and we had a look at basic navigation and as a nice

2
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.490
side effect, we I think built a pretty nice app thus far.

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.550
Now obviously, you can tweak that app and continue working on that to really fine tune it to your requirements

4
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.530
but I want to dive in to more navigation related features and one such feature is that I want to have

5
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.210
some tabs at the bottom here which allow me to go to my favorited recipes

6
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.410
and right now, we got no way of marking a meal as a recipe, we'll add that of course.

7
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.460
So to go to my favorites then or to go to all these categories we got here.

8
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.810
So for that, we want tabs and I want tabs at the bottom of this category screen and also at the bottom

9
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.720
of this to be added favoritesScreen and actually the way you add tabs

10
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.700
in Flutter works such that you add a totally new screen and I'll name that tabs_screen.dart, the

11
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.290
name is up to you of course

12
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.250
and that is a screen which will only manage the tabs and then load different screens depending on which

13
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.710
tab was selected.

14
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.480
So the TabsScreen itself is a widget, though it will be a stateful widget here and I'll name it tabs

15
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.130
screen

16
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.420
and with this snippet the Flutter extension gives me in Visual Studio Code, the widget

17
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.340
and its state that belongs to it is created automatically.

18
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.690
Now as always, we need to import material.dart in here and now we can start working with that. So

19
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.340
the TabsScreen here is in the end, should be TabsScreen by the way,

20
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.980
so let's fix that in all these places.

21
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.790
So the TabsScreen here has the goal of rendering the tabs and then the appropriate content for each

22
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.020
tab depending on which tab was selected.

23
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.090
So the TabsScreen will fill out the overall page in the end and hence here in the build method, we should

24
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.160
return a scaffold widget because you learned if you want to manage the entire screen with a widget, you

25
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.140
typically use a scaffold there

26
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.340
since this sets the background color, lets you add an appBar and also as you will now see, lets you

27
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.210
add tabs. Now actually, there are two ways of adding tabs to Flutter apps

28
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.160
and I will show you both. The first way is that you add the tabs not at the bottom of the screen but at the

29
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.290
bottom of your appBar

30
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.460
and that's something you see in some of the Android apps that are out there. For that pattern, 

31
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.850
you actually don't return a scaffold here but a default tab controller widget which then has a scaffold

32
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.890
widget as its child.

33
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.750
Now besides that scaffold child widget, the default tab controller also has a length argument where you

34
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.360
define how many tabs you want to have

35
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.410
and I want to have two, one for all categories and one for the favorite items.

36
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:14.210
Now in scaffold, you then add your appBar and that is the normal appBar and on that appBar, you can

37
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:23.670
of course set your title, like meals, whatever you want and you can then add a bottom argument to add

38
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:33.110
that tabs element or that tabs bar at the bottom of this widget and then inside of that bottom, you add

39
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.950
the TabBar widget which Flutter provides.

40
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:49.560
The TabBar widget Flutter gives you here now takes a tabs argument which is a list of widgets. In

41
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.640
that list of widgets, you now add tab widgets,

42
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.080
again these are all widgets provided by Flutter and I will have two tabs here because that's the length

43
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.130
I specified here and that is the amount of tabs I need.

44
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:11.220
So now here, each tab typically takes an icon which is displayed and here we could go with 

45
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.570
icons.category for the category page and you can also set a text here and text actually takes a

46
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.160
string, not a widget and that could be categories and here,

47
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.970
icon takes an icon widget,

48
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.180
so we should wrap icons category with that. So that's the first tab, on the second tab,

49
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.410
we also add an icon which takes an icon widget which then wraps icons. and then star is a good icon

50
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.260
for indicating that this will manage some favorites here and then we also add a text and here we

51
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.540
could have favorites as a text,

52
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.490
so that's the second tab.

53
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.060
Now the default tab controller and the TabBar here are automatically connected by Flutter behind the

54
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.610
scenes to work together.

55
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.680
So the default tab controller will automatically detect which tab you selected and then show the right

56
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.770
content for that tab,

57
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.810
you just need you tell it which content to show for which tab and therefore to your scaffold,

58
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.900
so after the appBar, you add your body

59
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.790
but now instead of adding a normal body, like a column or a text, you add a TabBarView and that's the

60
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.910
last piece that's all connected together behind the scenes by Flutter. The TabBarView is taken into

61
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.960
account by the default tab controller in conjunction with your TabBar and Flutter then keeps track

62
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:42.270
which tab you selected and if it's the first tab, then the first element which you add here to 

63
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.360
TabBarView will be shown

64
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.890
and if it's the second tab, the second element will be shown because to TabBarView, you add children

65
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:58.410
and now you should add as many child widgets here as you have tabs because then the child widget for

66
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.440
each tab will be shown as the main body of this screen and therefore here, we could now add categories,

67
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.330
the categories screen and later also add the favoritesScreen which we yet have to add.

68
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.680
Now first of all, let me fix the import for categories screen here,

69
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:23.380
I want to use a relative import and remove screens were already in that folder and with that, add a new

70
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.250
file which I'll name favorites_screen.dart

71
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.010
and for now, that will be a plain stateless widget favoritesScreen

72
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.640
where you

73
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.850
as always should import material.dart of course to unlock stateless widget and so on and then just as

74
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:46.040
before, simply as a dummy here, I will show some centered text here,

75
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.070
the favorites and later of course, we'll really populate that with favorites.

76
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.170
Now please note that I'm not using scaffold here and I'm doing it on purpose here and I'll show you

77
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.420
why in a second.

78
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:05.330
So back in the TabsScreen, we now use the favoritesScreen as the second widget here in our list of widgets.

79
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.610
Now both widgets should be instantiated, so you need concrete objects here and now the default tab controller

80
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.440
up there will automatically switch between them as you switch between these two tabs

81
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.790
and of course the order of the tabs here should belong or should match the order of your screens here,

82
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.180
first

83
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:32.470
tab triggers or activates this screen, second tab activates this screen. With that, let's load the tabs

84
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:39.160
screen as our default screen. So in the main.dart file, instead of loading categories screen as the default,

85
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.520
I now want to load tabs screen as the default

86
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.860
and of course for that, you need to import the tabs screen and you know me,

87
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.790
I will of course adjust that path here to be a relative path.

88
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.820
So now the TabsScreen is loaded as a default and if we now do a full restart here with that green arrow

89
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.010
at the top,

90
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.400
this is what we get. Now we have tabs here and what you also now see is that we have a duplicate appBar

91
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.020
for categories but not for favorites.

92
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:18.660
Now remember that for favorites, I mentioned that I did deliberately not add a scaffold here.

93
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:25.030
The reason for that is that now the favoritesScreen still kind of is like a screen, it still occupies

94
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.910
the majority of our page but it doesn't manage the entire page.

95
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.990
Of course, we still have our tabs in the appBar of the TabsScreen up there.

96
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:39.010
So the content we load into a tab should now not bring its own scaffold because it will not control the

97
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.409
entire page,

98
00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:46.290
instead it will be a part of the TabsScreen, the favoritesScreen is now only controlling that bottom

99
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.530
part here.

100
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:55.030
So for the categories screen, you should now also get rid of the scaffold here and just return what you

101
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.200
want to show in the content,

102
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:03.100
so in my case here, the GridView and of course then also delete redundant parentheses at the bottom and

103
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.090
with that change,

104
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.880
now this looks better.

105
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.410
Now you can of course configure these tabs,

106
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:16.930
so here in the TabBar, you can control a bunch of things, a lot of that is never required but you can

107
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.290
change the color your tabs or the

108
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:26.470
icons there will have when they are getting activated, which color your text in the tabs has and so

109
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.800
on,

110
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.560
you can register a listener to any user tabs in case you also want to do something in that case. So you

111
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.770
can configure a lot there

112
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:40.810
and of course simply play around with the TabBar to see what exactly you can control there. On the default

113
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.040
tab controller,

114
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:48.340
you can also for example set the initial index and by default, that is 0 which means that the first tab

115
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.420
is selected

116
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:55.240
but if you wanted to select the second one, the favorites one, then you would set this to index 1 and this

117
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.220
index works like the index in a list,

118
00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.560
it starts at 0 not at 1.

119
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:08.660
So now with that if I select 1 here as a default value and I do a full restart, you see we start with the

120
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.750
favorite selected here.

121
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.130
So that is all something you can do,

122
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:18.380
again 0 is the default, it doesn't need to be configured and that is one way of adding tabs in case you
  

123
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:18.960
want that

124
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.150
ook where you have your tabs here sit right below your appBar.
