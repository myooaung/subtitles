00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.040
So in the previous lecture,

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.890
we installed Flutter and Android Studio

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.560
so that we can build Android apps with Flutter.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.140
Now in this lecture, we'll create a Flutter project

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.300
and see how we can then edit the code

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.580
and how we can run this Flutter app

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.440
that will be in that project, on our emulator.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.610
And for this, we go back to this command prompt.

9
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.780
In there, we have this Flutter command,

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.430
which we can now use, and we can also use it

11
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.550
to create new projects.

12
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.160
Now for this, you first of all,

13
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.660
should navigate inside of this command prompt

14
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.460
into the folder where you wanna create your project.

15
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.980
And you can use the CD command for that,

16
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.090
which stands for change directory.

17
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.070
And here you could, for example,

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670
CD into a folder named development,

19
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.280
if you have such a folder.

20
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.360
I did create that folder before, in my user folder.

21
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.650
And then in that development folder,

22
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.069
you can CD into sub folders.

23
00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.730
Now I don't have any sub folders yet,

24
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.280
so what I'll quickly do is in Explorer,

25
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.730
I'll go into that folder, create a new folder there,

26
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.440
which I'll name projects.

27
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.980
Name is up to you.

28
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.030
And then here, back in the command prompt,

29
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.150
I can navigate into this projects folder by typing CD proj

30
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.760
and then I hit tab for auto completion.

31
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.730
And now I'm in that path where I wanna create

32
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.850
my new Flutter folder, and you should use

33
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.270
some global path like this.

34
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.710
Now, once you have that folder,

35
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.210
you can use the flutter command again,

36
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.210
but now we'll run flutter create to create a new project.

37
00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.860
And then when you use that command,

38
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.540
which is exposed by Flutter,

39
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.860
you need to give your project a name.

40
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.520
And I'll name it first_app here.

41
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.870
You should use a name that is something like this

42
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.870
that does not contain any wide space, no dashes, no dots,

43
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.160
instead under scores if you have multiple words

44
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.410
which you wanna separate.

45
00:02:07.923 --> 00:02:11.290
And then you can hit enter, and this will now create

46
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.260
a brand new Flutter project in there,

47
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.710
hence in the Explorer and the projects folder,

48
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.953
I now have this first_app folder,

49
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.890
and now we want to open that with some tool that allows us

50
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.963
to view and edit the code.

51
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.490
We could use Android Studio for that,

52
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.710
but since it's a bit heavy and a bit slow in my opinion,

53
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.093
I will use a different tool which has great Flutter support,

54
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.070
and that's Visual Studio Code.

55
00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:41.760
You can search for VS Code

56
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.170
to find code.visualstudio.com,

57
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.810
and VS Code is a free IDE,

58
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.540
a free code editor provided by Microsoft,

59
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.780
which you can download for all operating systems,

60
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.010
which allows you to edit code, not just Flutter code,

61
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.300
but a lot of other programming languages and frameworks

62
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.093
as well, but it does have great Flutter support as well.

63
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.780
So here I'll just download it, and then once

64
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.870
that download finished I'll execute this installer,

65
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.520
which it gives me,

66
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.600
accept the agreement, use the default location,

67
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.810
keep all the other defaults,

68
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.390
and make sure it's added to your path.

69
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.990
This here is in German, but it basically says

70
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.420
that it's added to the path variable.

71
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.540
So I'll keep that and then install it.

72
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.720
And now this will install this Visual Studio Code tool

73
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.093
on our system, which we can use for editing code.

74
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.970
So let's wait for this to finish,

75
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.583
and then we can also start it right away.

76
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.240
And if you start it, you see something like this,

77
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.290
a little starting screen where you can also choose a theme,

78
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.270
and I'll go with the dark theme.

79
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.270
You can also edit this if you go to file, preferences,

80
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.710
and then color theme, here you can also switch the theme,

81
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.930
and I'll use dark plus.

82
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.310
Close this, and then before we open a project,

83
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.160
we'll also install a couple of extensions

84
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.420
because a great feature of Visual Studio Code is that

85
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.330
it has built in extensions support,

86
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.030
and extensions are basically just plug-ins,

87
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.863
which you can install into Visual Studio Code.

88
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.250
So for that, we can go to view, extensions

89
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.820
or use this shortcut here

90
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.940
or click on extensions here on the left.

91
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.180
And then there, there are a couple of extensions

92
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.520
you should install.

93
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.300
Most importantly, you want to search for Flutter here

94
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.193
and install this Flutter extension.

95
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.660
This helps you with writing Flutter code and provides

96
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.620
great support whilst you are writing Flutter code.

97
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.830
So inside of this editor,

98
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.990
you'll then get great support for Flutter.

99
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.910
This also installed a Dart extension automatically,

100
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.270
which will help with Dart code in general,

101
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.590
and Flutter user start, as you learned.

102
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.710
And last but not least, I'll search for Material Icon,

103
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.800
which is totally optional, but which changes

104
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.500
the look of the file icons, and I like that look.

105
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.460
I'm using it throughout this course, and if you want it too,

106
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.950
you can install this Material Icon Theme here

107
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.430
to get that icon look, and then in this dropdown

108
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.010
which opens, I'll select Material Icon Theme

109
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.980
to set my icon look to it.

110
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.573
Click activate here as well.

111
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.260
Okay, so now I got all these things installed.

112
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.460
Now we can open our newly created Flutter project

113
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.040
with Visual Studio Code, and for that here under file,

114
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.271
I'll choose open folder and then go into

115
00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:55.356
the development folder, projects,

116
00:05:55.356 --> 00:05:57.530
and select this first_app folder,

117
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.890
the entire folder and choose that folder.

118
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.050
And then here, I'm prompted whether I want to trust

119
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.183
this folder, and I'll choose yes here.

120
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.490
I'll also accept the recommended VS Code settings

121
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.593
for Dart and Flutter and click on yes here as well.

122
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.830
Now here, we got this Flutter project

123
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.543
opened up in Visual Studio Code.

124
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.100
Now the starting project you get and the exact files

125
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.120
and folders you have in there could vary over time,

126
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.450
and therefore, to ensure that we're all on the same page,

127
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.020
attached you'll find my popspec.yaml file,

128
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.680
so this file here, and my main.dart file in the lib folder,

129
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.270
and you should replace your content in the lib folder

130
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.390
with my main.dart file so if you have more folders

131
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.560
and files in the lib folder, delete them all and use

132
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.470
my attached main.dart file and drag it into

133
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.130
this lib folder and replace

134
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.320
your pubspec.yaml file with mine.

135
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.210
With that, we simply ensure that you have

136
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.000
exactly the same starting configuration and project as I do

137
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.463
and you get the same output as I do.

138
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.110
And with that, we got this set up and we can now run

139
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.323
this project here, and of course also edit it.

140
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.240
Now I'll walk through the different folders and files

141
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.850
and what we have here in the next course section,

142
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.590
so I'll ignore that for now, and instead, I wanna show you

143
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.240
how you can run such a Flutter project

144
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.010
as an Android app here on this Android emulator

145
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.460
which we have up and running.

146
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.570
And this can be done by going to terminal here

147
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.053
and clicking on new terminal in the VS Code menu here.

148
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.290
And this is your system command prompt,

149
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.860
just integrated into VS Code.

150
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.000
The great thing about that is that we can run commands in it

151
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.200
without leaving our project here

152
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.470
and without leaving our code, so we can have

153
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.433
multiple things on the same screen.

154
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.610
And in here, what you can now do to run your application

155
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.210
on this emulator is you can run flutter run,

156
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.960
just make sure that this emulator is up and running.

157
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.110
And then flutter run is a command that will take

158
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.270
your Flutter code, convert it to machine code for Android

159
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.800
in this case, since we have an Android emulator

160
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.420
up and running, and run that Android app on that emulator.

161
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.950
And later in the course, you will also learn how to

162
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.330
run it on real devices and how to

163
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.690
build for different platforms.

164
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.549
Very important, you need to run it inside of your project.

165
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.370
That's why I'm using this integrated terminal because this

166
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.770
integrated terminal will automatically be navigated into

167
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.550
this Flutter project so that this command

168
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.223
is executed from inside that project.

169
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.080
And if you now hit enter,

170
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.250
this will do what I just explained.

171
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.430
It will build your Flutter project as an Android app

172
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.703
and then run it on that Android emulator.

173
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.970
Now the first time you execute this,

174
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.030
this can take a bit longer, so definitely give this

175
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.000
some time, but eventually it should be done,

176
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.340
and then start this Flutter app as an Android app,

177
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.340
as a native Android app on this Android simulator.

178
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.773
So let's wait for that to finish,

179
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.760
and by the way, this will be quite slow and take some time

180
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.600
the first time you do this.

181
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.620
Subsequent changes and restarts will be faster,

182
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.223
so no worries about that.

183
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.350
And now here for me it's crashing, actually.

184
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.560
It's crashing with this error message

185
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.560
that Kotlin could not find the required JDK tools.

186
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.680
If you're not getting this, perfect.

187
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.620
If you are getting it, what you have to do

188
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.440
is Google for, JDK 8, and you should find this page

189
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.440
on oracle.com and then there, pick the download version

190
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.140
for your system.

191
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.080
In my case, Windows.

192
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.180
Now, here we can then download this,

193
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.020
and unfortunately we have to create an account here.

194
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.883
It's free, but we have to do that.

195
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.160
And once you did create that account and then sign in

196
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.760
on this page, the download will start, of this JDK tool,

197
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.690
which we now need to fix this error which we got during

198
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.840
building this Android app with Flutter here.

199
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.003
So let's wait for this download to finish,

200
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.650
and then we can simply walk through this installer,

201
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.663
keep all the defaults here,

202
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.380
and install this Java development kit,

203
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.620
which Android needs under the hood.

204
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.570
And you might not need that because in some installations,

205
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.890
this is set up correctly right from the start.

206
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.423
For me here it wasn't.

207
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.870
I'll also confirm the defaults here

208
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.240
and install Java itself and make sure that

209
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.743
all these tools are installed here.

210
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.913
And once this was installed successfully,

211
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.800
you can go back and you can run flutter run again,

212
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.530
and now this time, it should succeed here

213
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.460
and it should build this application.

214
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.320
And it now also sends this application queue,

215
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.740
this Android emulator, which is up and running here.

216
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.100
And here, you can now play around with this starting app,

217
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.570
which you get if you use my attached files,

218
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.370
the main.dart file and the pubspec.yaml file

219
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.490
as instructed earlier.

220
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.660
And this is now our Flutter project, our Flatter app,

221
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.113
running as a native Android app on this Android simulator.

222
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.600
And now that this is up and running

223
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.520
with that flutter run process, which is a process

224
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.610
that is still running, we can actually now go into

225
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.210
one of our code files here and then search that line

226
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.393
where counter plus plus is executed, line 58,

227
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.050
and change that a little bit.

228
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.870
Now, by the way, I will explain all that code

229
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.570
and how Dart and Flutter work throughout this entire course.

230
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.050
For the moment, we'll just make a quick change here

231
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.430
and change line 58 to say

232
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.393
underscore counter equals underscore counter plus two.

233
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.780
If you then save this file by pressing control, S

234
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.997
so that you don't have this bullet next to

235
00:12:34.997 --> 00:12:38.660
the file name anymore, then you don't have to run

236
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.620
flutter run again to see this change in the running app,

237
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.720
but instead with this ongoing process that was started

238
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.950
by executing flutter run, we can now press R

239
00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.500
to perform a so-called hot reload, which basically means

240
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.240
that our updated code is injected into this running app,

241
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.470
which is a quick way of seeing changes

242
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.070
without restarting everything.

243
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.230
So therefore now, if I press R,

244
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.180
this hot reload is performed,

245
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.070
and now if I click the plus here,

246
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.870
this counter changes by two instead of one as before

247
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.630
because of this code change,

248
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.680
which is reflected by this hot reload.

249
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.110
Alternatively, you can also perform a so-called hot restart

250
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.300
by pressing shift, R, which will then also still be quicker

251
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.760
than running flutter run again, but which will restart

252
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.450
that app that's running on the emulator,

253
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.180
which is why now the counter is reset to zero.

254
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.690
And that's how we could run our application here.

255
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.800
Now, I am saying could because whilst this works,

256
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.810
it can be a bit annoying that we have to press R

257
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.913
or shift, R all the time.

258
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.380
Therefore, I'll quit this running flatter run process

259
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.800
by pressing control, C here in this terminal

260
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.580
and confirming it with Y, and I'll close this terminal

261
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.230
because since we installed that Flutter extension earlier,

262
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.920
we also have a different way of running our projects,

263
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.520
our Flutter projects as apps on emulators,

264
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.890
and that will be the way I use throughout this course.

265
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.433
We can go to run and then choose run without debugging.

266
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.760
Later in the course, we will also dive into debugging,

267
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.950
but for now, let's run it without debugging.

268
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.900
And this now also runs flutter run under the hood,

269
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.920
but we don't see it here.

270
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.220
We don't actively have to run this.

271
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.040
We still get a terminal window here, but that's now

272
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.290
actually just a little output window,

273
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.800
which shows info messages and possible warnings to us,

274
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.350
and then we get prompted whether we want to open

275
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.910
the Dart dev tools.

276
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.730
I'll not do that here.

277
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.333
We will see them later, so I'll choose not now for now,

278
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.983
and again, we'll have our app here on this emulator,

279
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.450
but now we have this control panel up here,

280
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.740
where we also could perform a hot reload

281
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.240
or a hot restart by clicking on these buttons

282
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.797
or using the shortcuts which you see here.

283
00:15:15.797 --> 00:15:18.950
And we can always stop this running process

284
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.973
by pressing this stop button,

285
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.070
but the great thing is that if you start your app like this,

286
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.360
you don't even have to use the hot reload button.

287
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.490
If I change my code, for example, to say plus three,

288
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.700
and I then save this, it will automatically perform

289
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.460
this hot reload, so it detects file changes.

290
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.730
So whenever we save a changed file,

291
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:45.570
and will automatically update the running app here.

292
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.760
And that's of course even more convenient

293
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.220
than manually triggering those updates

294
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.140
with R or shift, R,

295
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.320
and therefore, that's how I will run my apps.

296
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.630
And if you are done for today,

297
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.310
you can always stop this process,

298
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.490
and then the app is shut down on the emulator,

299
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.990
and if you want to work on it again,

300
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.300
you just start this again.

301
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.360
And that's what we'll do throughout the course,

302
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.860
and of course, in the course, I will then also explain

303
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.223
all that code and how Flutter and Dart work.

304
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.080
Now, feel free to also tweak

305
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.190
the appearance of Visual Studio Code

306
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.370
here with the appearance menu.

307
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:27.040
You can show and hide the sidebars and various other areas

308
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.840
so that you like your editor.

309
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.060
So make sure you tweak it like that,

310
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.720
and then therefore, we are now done and we can continue.

311
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.480
Now, I will say that throughout the rest of the course,

312
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.920
I am working on Mac, but the code you write

313
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.160
is exactly the same, so it won't make a difference for you,

314
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.440
and I also will be using the Android emulator

315
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.730
throughout the course so that's exactly the same

316
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.150
for you also if you use Windows.

317
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.320
So just because I'm using Mac in the next lectures,

318
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.950
and in this entire course, does not mean that you need

319
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.090
to change anything or that you can't follow along.

320
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.320
You can follow along just fine

321
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.183
because the code will be the same.
