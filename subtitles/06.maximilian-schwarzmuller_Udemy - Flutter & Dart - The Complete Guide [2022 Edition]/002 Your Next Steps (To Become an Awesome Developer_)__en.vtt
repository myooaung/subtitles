00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.380
So what are my recommendations for next steps that you could take?

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.170
Now my first recommendation is that you really use this course as a reference.

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.540
Don't see it as a one time experience which you just completed and where you just got your certificate

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.760
and you're done with it. Instead

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:25.060
use it as a reference where you can go back to individual lectures or modules, repeat certain concepts

6
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.670
or if you're building an app, look for the part in the course where we covered that feature that you

7
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.940
might need in your next app.

8
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.140
It definitely is an option that you go through the entire course or through parts of the course more

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.340
than once because that's really what an on demand course should also be.

10
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.410
It shouldn't just be a one time experience, it's not a classroom,

11
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.370
it's not restricted to four weeks of access, you can lifetime access so use that.

12
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.520
Now also important and even more important than just using this course is that you practice, practice

13
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.290
and practice,

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
you need to build stuff. In this course,

15
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.000
we built a lot of applications,

16
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.810
you had quizzes to check your knowledge but you need to build your own projects because when you do

17
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.550
so, you will hit errors, you'll face problems and that is a normal thing

18
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.210
as a developer. Solving these problems is what makes you a better developer,

19
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.970
solving these problems with the help of Google, Stack Overflow, blog posts, the official docs and of course

20
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.020
also this course, that is how you will grow as a developer. So build stuff, build dummy projects, build

21
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.690
the applications we built in the course without looking at the course lectures and try to rebuild the

22
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.820
apps from scratch,

23
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.590
that's what will make you a better developer and what will really let Flutter sink in.

24
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.500
In addition as I also kind of already mentioned, dive into Stack Overflow, join Flutter discussions

25
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.800
there, dive into official examples or examples in general which you'll find plentiful in the web, on Github

26
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.560
and so on,

27
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.630
dive into blog posts which you can find.

28
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.260
Google is your friend there, you'll find so many resources on Flutter and new resources are coming up

29
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.190
all the time.

30
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.550
These are great resources to explore alternative patterns, ideas, maybe widgets what you haven't seen

31
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.180
before or different ways of building something or simply a solution for a problem you're facing. Now

32
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.090
as I mentioned in the practice part, build dummy apps, practicing some tiny isolated features is one thing

33
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.020
but also build entire apps.

34
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.850
You don't necessarily need to publish them but build apps, build clones of popular apps,

35
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.400
of course

36
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.170
maybe leave out some features and focus on a couple of core features but build stuff,

37
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.420
as mentioned, that is really important

38
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.550
and last but not least, help each other. Be friendly,

39
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.840
join the community,

40
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.690
be that on Stack Overflow or here in the course

41
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.680
Q & A section. Help other students, help them solve problems because helping others will also help

42
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.320
you because if you think about problems, if you explore solutions and if you share these solutions and

43
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.890
you therefore have to describe them, you again grow as a developer.

44
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.080
These are my recommendations on how you should continue. Now in the next lecture,

45
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.300
I'll also share a rough blueprint on how you could approach upcoming app projects and how I think that

46
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.680
you can build apps or how you should go through an app production process in a way that will help you

47
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.860
plan the app,

48
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.870
sketch the app, build the app, test it and then finally also deploy it.
