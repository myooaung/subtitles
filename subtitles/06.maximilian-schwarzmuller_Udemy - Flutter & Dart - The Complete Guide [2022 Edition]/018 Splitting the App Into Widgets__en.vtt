1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.810
Let's add a stateful widget. Now which widget should be stateful?

2
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.380
Right now we only have one widget,

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.980
the widget in our main file.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.690
We could turn this into a stateful widget but that would have at least two disadvantages which are

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.340
kind of connected.

6
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.580
For one, it's already a pretty large widget,

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.890
we have a pretty complex widget tree in there and it is a good practice and good idea to split your

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.610
large widgets into smaller widgets,

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.360
that makes it easier to read them, to work on them, to maintain them

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.940
and also from a performance perspective, as soon as you start having stateful widgets that also rebuild

11
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.660
when you change something, you should split your app so that you don't rebuild your entire widget tree

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.970
just because a transaction changed.

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:58.640
For example here, the part where we handle the user input, that is where we get the data for the new transaction

14
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.640
but of course this box up here doesn't change just because we added a new transaction, in this box

15
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.250
we don't show the new transaction

16
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.190
so there is no need to repaint this with every new transaction we added or with every change in the

17
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.770
transactions list in general.

18
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.030
So it would make sense to kind of have that list of transactions in a separate widget and therefore

19
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:31.790
let's create a new file here which I'll name transaction_list.dart.

20
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.790
Now in addition, I now also want to make it really clear which files here are widgets and which files

21
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.120
are normal classes,

22
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.050
for example the transaction.dart file is a normal class, it's not a widget at all.

23
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.620
This here, the transaction class serves as a model for our data and

24
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.140
therefore here, I'll create a new folder, models and move the transaction.dart file in there

25
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.980
and if we had more models, if we had different types of data, different custom types, we would also add

26
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.950
them here.

27
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.790
In the main.dart file, I now also have to adjust my import here and import from

28
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.389
./models.transaction.dart because I moved that file in there.

29
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.470
Now the transaction list on the other hand is a widget and therefore, I'll also create a new subfolder,

30
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.890
widgets.

31
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.840
Now here I'll move the transaction_list.dart file into the widgets folder.

32
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.210
Now of course right now it might look a bit overkill to have two folders for only two files but the

33
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.160
more widgets we add, the more sense the separation makes because it's then way easier for us to find

34
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.650
out what's a widget and what's a model.

35
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.800
So in the transaction list file here, I want to create a new stateful widget now and for this, I'll use

36
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.730
the shortcut here,

37
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.500
this little snippet the Flutter extension gives me in Visual Studio Code to scaffold out a stateful

38
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.050
widget, it automatically creates the widget class and the state class and it places a couple of markers

39
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.950
where you can now type the name and it inserts the name in all the places that need it.

40
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.720
So here, I'll name this transaction list, using this pascal case naming convention of having uppercase

41
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.620
starting characters for the words but having only one word altogether.

42
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.740
Now in here, I need to import material.dart from the Flutter package because we're using stateful

43
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.130
widget which is exposed by that package, also the state is coming from there

44
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.550
and of course build context, the widget type and the container type here and with all of that, we have

45
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.250
our base widget setup. Now in here,

46
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.730
I want to manage my list of transactions,

47
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:40.840
so with that I mean my list of transaction objects. In here, we can therefore add a final list of transactions

48
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.880
and for that, make sure you add an import to your transaction model with

49
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.820
../models/transactions,

50
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.670
dot dot because we need to go up one level where in the widgets folder, dot dot tells Dart to go up

51
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.400
one level,

52
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.490
so out of the widgets folder and then it looks for a new folder, models which then exists in that lib

53
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.500
folder in which we then are and there, in the models folder, it gets access to the transaction.dart

54
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.610
file.

55
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.570
So then we have a list of transactions here and I'll name this user transactions, any name you want and

56
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.540
initially,

57
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.860
I'll have the transactions in here which we previously had in the main.dart file.

58
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:24.210
So let's grab these two transaction objects here,

59
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.040
cut them in the main.dart file and move them into the transaction list, like this.

60
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.650
So now we have these two dummy transactions here to start with,

61
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.500
by the way if you're wondering why this is final, we will still be able to edit this list as you will

62
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.990
see

63
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.910
and I will come back to why this works and how it works in a second.

64
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.050
So now we have these two transactions in here, now in the build method

65
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.330
here, I of course want to build that list of transaction widgets. In the main.dart file,

66
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.430
I can get rid of that transaction list and also get rid of that input here from the models folder

67
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.400
of course

68
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.820
and if we scroll down to that error which my IDE displays, this is the part where I output the list of

69
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.180
transactions, this is the part which we can grab

70
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.610
now, this entire column here,

71
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.820
cut it out of the main.dart file and of our widget there and add it instead as the return value in our

72
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.140
transaction list here. Now in there,

73
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.880
I'm accessing date format and date format

74
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.250
on the other hand requires us to import the intl package, so we can remove that import from the

75
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.580
main.dart file and add it here in the transaction_list.dart file so that we can format the date and transactions,

76
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.610
that's the wrong property name, here

77
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.230
I renamed it to _userTransactions

78
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.250
should be the name,

79
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.320
so _userTransactions,

80
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.770
so let's use this here.

81
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.400
Now we have the transactions managed in here but now we'll face a new problem,

82
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:59.880
we're adding transactions from inside our card here with the text fields and that card is actually a

83
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.130
sibling to our transaction list widget which we would add here.

84
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.740
So add transaction list here next to the card,

85
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.840
that's why these ending annotations which the Flutter extension adds are really useful,

86
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.390
so next to the card where you have your text fields and of course to use the transaction list widget

87
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:26.260
here, you have to import it from ./widgets/transaction_list.dart.

88
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.550
But as I just said, we now have a problem because in transaction lists, we have our list of transactions

89
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.700
and this list should change

90
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.890
but the change is triggered by our text fields which reside in the main.dart file.

91
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:48.870
So what can we do about that? Well in the end, we have to do something which is called lifting state up,

92
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.370
which means the common denominator of our text field card here and of the transaction list,

93
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:03.620
so the one widget where we use them both is of course still my homepage widget here.

94
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:10.670
So there actually is no way around managing our own state, our transactions in here because we need to add

95
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:16.130
a new transaction to that list from inside our text fields here or with the help of our text fields

96
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.770
and then we need to pass that down to the transaction list which is nice for outputting our transactions

97
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.730
but bad for managing them because if we manage our transactions here in transaction list, then we have

98
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:35.090
no way of accessing the user transactions list here from outside of that transaction list widget,

99
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.970
the problem just is our text fields here are not inside of the transaction list.

100
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.620
So of course we could alternatively also take that card with all the text fields and add it to our transaction

101
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.090
list,

102
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.570
that would work

103
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.830
but I actually prefer a different approach.

104
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.470
Let's add two new widgets - one for our text input area here,

105
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:04.330
so for the card with the text fields simply to make that main widget tree a bit leaner and second, let's

106
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.170
then put our text input widget which we'll create

107
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.280
and that transaction list widget,

108
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:16.510
let's put that together into a new third widget which we then use here in the main widget, in

109
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.910
MyHomePage widget.

110
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:25.570
The advantage of this will be that the MyHomePage widget can stay stateless and things like the scaffold

111
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.670
and the app bar aren't rebuilt

112
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:33.250
just because we added a new transaction, because these things really are not affected by a new transaction.

113
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.960
The parts that do need to interact with a new transaction,

114
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:42.980
so our text input card here and the transaction list will then live in a separate widget.

115
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.550
So let's add two new widgets as I just said,

116
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:54.130
one is the new_transaction.dart file which will hold our text fields and one is the

117
00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:02.530
user_transactions.dart file. In the new_transaction.dart file, I'll create a stateless

118
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:11.150
widget which I'll call new transaction and in here, as in all your widget files, you need to import

119
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.300
material.dart so that you unlock stateless widget and so on.

120
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.770
Now let's go back to the main.dart file and grab that card with all the text fields in there,

121
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:26.910
so this entire card here, grab it, cut it, remove it from the main.dart file and return it here in the

122
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.650
new transaction file.

123
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.430
Now we have the amount and the title controller in here,

124
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:39.110
so let's add that, let's add these properties in the new transaction widget. The title controller is a

125
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.020
text editing controller, so instantiate that and store it in a final property and the same for the amount

126
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.610
controller,

127
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.590
that's the exact same step we did in the main file earlier.

128
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.750
So now this works, now in the main.dart file,

129
00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:01.830
we can simply use our new transaction widget here, instantiate it and add an import at the top.

130
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:07.570
Again my IDE automatically added one and whilst this would work, the recommended syntax actually is used

131
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.640
as relative import syntax with ./widgets/new_transaction in this case

132
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.150
and now we have a leaner main.dart file.

133
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:21.480
Now to avoid having to manage the state in here for these two widgets where actually at the moment,

134
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.320
MyHomePage is the common denominator, to avoid having to manage them here,

135
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.030
we have that new user transactions file here.

136
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:40.200
That will now hold a stateful widget named user transactions, where as always, you have to import

137
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.300
material.dart

138
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:47.520
and now here, I actually want to use my new transaction and my transaction list widget.

139
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:53.940
So the goal here is to return a simple column with these two widgets, actually

140
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.140
basically what we have here,

141
00:10:55.150 --> 00:11:01.150
a column with these two widgets. So you can cut the two widgets here from main.dart file and therefore

142
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:08.830
also of course get rid of these import statements there and instead in the user transactions file, return

143
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.770
a column because we want to have two widgets sit on top of each other, hence we need a column and in that

144
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.240
column,

145
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:24.390
add these two widgets and of course also add the imports, so import ./new_transaction.dart and

146
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:30.630
import ./transaction_list.dart.

147
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:36.850
Now we can manage our list of transactions here in the user transactions state,

148
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.770
so in the transaction_list.dart file,

149
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.220
we actually don't need a stateful widget,

150
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.380
instead let's use a stateless widget here

151
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.030
and that means we can get rid of this part of the create state

152
00:11:52.730 --> 00:12:03.170
method here and then also of our state class. Cut that list of transactions here, leave the build method

153
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:11.670
in here of course, we still need that but now go to the user transactions file and there to the user

154
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:17.110
transaction state and add that _userTransactions property there.

155
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.460
Here I'm also using the transaction type, my transaction model,

156
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:26.080
so we have to go out of the widgets folder to the models folder and then import my transaction.dart

157
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.350
file here.

158
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:36.370
Now we're almost there but now we need to pass user transactions to the transaction list widget here

159
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.470
and you learned how that works.
