00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.820
Now, to build an app, I have a brand new flutter app here, a basic app as it comes created by Flutter

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.570
Create, and you find this snapshot, this main dart and display aspect on Yamal file attached in case

3
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.600
you want to start with the exact same app.

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.390
And I also already launched it here on an Android emulator.

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.960
And as you can see, this is really our standard starting app here.

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.090
So now let's turn it into the app we actually want.

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.810
And for that, of course, I'm going to utilize all that knowledge we gathered for that cause, though

8
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.360
the app we build will not be too fancy because I rather want to focus on those firebase features and

9
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.280
how to utilize those features in a flutter app in this module.

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.330
Nonetheless, we'll need a bunch of different elements here, to be precise.

11
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.980
We'll at least need two screens because we'll definitely have those two screens login and authentication

12
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.750
screen and the chat screen.

13
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.319
And of course, we'll also need a couple of widgets.

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.190
Now, for that, I'll add a screen folder where we can add those screens and a widgets folder which

15
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.670
will hold any other widgets which are not standalone screens in the screens folder.

16
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.820
I'll add my auth underscore screenshots dart file, which will hold the authentication screen and I'll

17
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.680
also add the jet screen, which you guessed it will hold to Chet.

18
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.900
And for widgets will add them as we go in as we need them.

19
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.040
Now, I will actually start with a basic chat screen here.

20
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.200
We will actually need authentication before we can chat.

21
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.950
But I want to show you how Firebase works, and that is best shown with the database feature and therefore

22
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.960
will start with the chat and will turn it into a real chat with users later.

23
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.910
So on the chat screen, let's create a new state, less widget actually, which will name chat screen

24
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.330
and make sure that in this file you import material dodge start from the flutter package.

25
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.800
And here I will not just return such a container, but I actually want to return a list view of chat

26
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.620
messages now for that, I'll use that builder mode here to have that item builder and you'll learn about

27
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.400
that in the course.

28
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.580
The item builder here takes a function, essentially, which gets the context and the index of the item

29
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.510
that is being built.

30
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.570
And then here in this arrow function, for example, we return the item, the widget that should be

31
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.130
built for every item we have in that list view.

32
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.500
So here we could build a simple, let's say, container where we have some padding with ATCH, INSETs,

33
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.500
all of eight to have a petting of eight in all directions and then a child, which is simply some text.

34
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.660
This works like that.

35
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.230
Now the list view builder also needs the item count so that we know how many items should be created.

36
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.500
And I'm just going to build 10 items here soon.

37
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.940
We'll build this dynamically.

38
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.060
Now, the chat screen, of course, should be visible, so let's go back to the main DARD file and here

39
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.000
I'll rename this title to Fleder Chat and get rid of that comment here.

40
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.190
Get rid of this comment here.

41
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.010
And here under home, I will not render my home page here, instead, I'll delete all that code down

42
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.310
there.

43
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.910
And instead, I will just render my chat screen here, so make sure you add that import here to the

44
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.380
chat screen dard file from your own package, this important is all to fine to use from the screens

45
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.370
folder and the chat screen dard file.

46
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.240
And with that, we have our chat screen being rendered here now, if we save everything and you have

47
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.330
a running emulator and you run your application on that emulator, you should see this works here.

48
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.510
Now, this looks ugly because we're missing a scaffold.

49
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.570
So let's go back to the chat screen and we can refactor this to wrap the list, view with the widget

50
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.310
and wrap it with a scaffold here.

51
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.100
Now, the scaffold does not have a child, but a body instead.

52
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.220
And if we do just add and we save this, this already looks a bit nicer.

53
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.940
Now, that's, of course, just some dummy static data.

54
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.640
So therefore, let's now explore Firebase and see how that works.
