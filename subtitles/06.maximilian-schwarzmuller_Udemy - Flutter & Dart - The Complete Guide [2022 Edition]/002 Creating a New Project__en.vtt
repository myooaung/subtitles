00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.110
Now, with the course introduction

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.060
and all the basics out of the way,

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.640
and with Flutter and Android Studio and so on

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.310
installed on our system,

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.510
it's now finally time to dive into Flutter development

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.110
and to learn Flutter and Dart.

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.400
And for that, we're going to create a new project here.

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.800
So for that, again, use the cd command

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.570
to navigate into some folder on your system

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.470
where you want to create that project.

11
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.890
And then once you navigated there

12
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.220
in your terminal or command prompt,

13
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.680
you run "flutter create" to create a new project

14
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.500
and give it any name you want.

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.477
And I'll name it "flutter_complete_guide."

16
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.340
The project name is up to you,

17
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.340
but it should not contain any dots or dashes

18
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.910
or white spaces.

19
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.890
Instead, if you have multiple words,

20
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.320
separate them with underscores.

21
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.790
And the convention also is to use an all lowercase name

22
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.163
like I'm using it here.

23
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.100
And then simply hit enter, and as you learn,

24
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.270
this will now create a new folder

25
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.180
in that path where you navigated to before,

26
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.160
and stored these initial Flutter project files

27
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.910
in that folder.

28
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.290
And then we can again use Visual Studio Code

29
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.180
or Android Studio to open that folder.

30
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.860
And that's what I did here.

31
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.193
So then, be get our Flutter project here.

32
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.310
Now, this Flutter project, which I got here

33
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.810
has a web folder,

34
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.780
and I'll delete that folder since we're not going to build

35
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.820
for the web here.

36
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660
So I'll just move that to trash.

37
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.960
But I'll keep all the other folders and files

38
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.220
which I have in there.

39
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.220
Now, I'll walk you through these folders and files

40
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.300
and what they do in the next lecture.

41
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.230
For the moment, I just want to make sure

42
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.823
that we have to same kind of starting project.

43
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.680
And to ensure this, attached you find my "pubspec.yaml" file

44
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.100
and a "main.dart" file.

45
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.970
And you should replace your "main.dart" file with mine

46
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.810
and delete any other files or folders you might have

47
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.300
in your lib folder with mine,

48
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.340
and replace your "pubspec.yaml" file with mine.

49
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.063
This is really important.

50
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.290
You then also might want to open this terminal,

51
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.730
and in that terminal, run "flutter packages get."

52
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.670
Typically this should not be required because Flutter

53
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.380
should run it behind the scenes automatically,

54
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.420
but this is important to ensure that Flutter picks up

55
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.713
that "pubspec.yaml" file, which I provided to you.

56
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.090
And this is really just important to ensure

57
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.090
that we're all starting on the same page

58
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.073
and you can follow along smoothly.

59
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.700
Now, as I said, in the next lecture,

60
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.200
I'll walk you through these folders and files.

61
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.060
For the moment, I just want to make sure

62
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.100
that we can start this project here

63
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.030
as an application on an emulator,

64
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.730
and you can use either the iOS or Android emulator,

65
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.880
but since everyone, including Windows users

66
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.900
will be able to use Android emulators,

67
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.490
I'll go for that.

68
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.010
So just as in the previous core section,

69
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.740
I'll quickly spin up an emulator again.

70
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.890
Of course, you might still have one

71
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.490
from the last section and then you can absolutely use that.

72
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.320
So, here I'll just quickly set up that emulator.

73
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.680
And once that emulator is up and running here,

74
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.910
we can run our Flutter app on that emulator,

75
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.250
either by using that terminal,

76
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.400
which you can open with terminal, new terminal,

77
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.460
and running "flutter run".

78
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.690
Or better, as you learned in the previous core section,

79
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.087
by going to "run," "run without debugging."

80
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.230
And then this should automatically run it.

81
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.020
Now you might get this dropdown where you have

82
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.590
to choose how you want to run your project.

83
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.930
And here, I will choose Dart and Flutter.

84
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.930
And then this will run your application on Android,

85
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.620
on the Android emulator and build it

86
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.140
as an Android app automatically since we

87
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.850
do have this Android emulator up and running here.

88
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.110
Now, the first time you run this,

89
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.079
as you saw in the previous core section

90
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.030
can take a bit longer.

91
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.300
But once this is finished,

92
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.380
we should have this counter app running

93
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.390
on the Android emulator again.

94
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.847
And then we can use this control panel up here

95
00:04:30.847 --> 00:04:34.240
to reload this app whenever we need to do that.

96
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.930
But as I showed you in the last core section,

97
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.490
whenever you change your code

98
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.400
and you save your code changes,

99
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.420
the great thing about this way of running the Flutter app

100
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.010
is that it will automatically reload

101
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.240
whenever you change your code.

102
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.803
So, let's now wait for this to start up.

103
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.810
And here we go, here's this application.

104
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.300
And again, if it just started, it might still be a bit slow,

105
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.580
but it should get more responsive quickly.

106
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.650
And then you can play around with it here,

107
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.730
and edit your code here.

108
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.320
And therefore that's now what we're going

109
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320
to do for all the discourse section.

110
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.540
In the next lecture,

111
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.300
we'll explore the files and folders we got here

112
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.283
and what they do.
