1
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.220
So how do we open the device camera?

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:15.700
The good thing is, if you'll remember, the first section offers module flutter, actually uses start

3
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.010
and it runs on an engine.

4
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.910
So to say, which gives you direct access to the system, to the operating system you're running on

5
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.780
so you can directly tap into such native device features.

6
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.619
Flutter gives you a direct bridge to these features.

7
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.370
And later, in a module, by the way, I'll also show you how you can actually ride your own native

8
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.870
Swift or Java code for ISIS or for Android and connect that to your Flat-Rate code and you'll see how

9
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.630
easy that is, because Flutter has all the features it needs to talk to the underlying platform.

10
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.310
So IOW, for Android, it has all the features it needs to talk to the platform built in.

11
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.340
So they offer talking to ISIS or to Android to open a camera is really simple.

12
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.300
Still, you would have to write some Java words, swift code to really then tell Android or IWK to open

13
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.840
a camera.

14
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.760
And of course, that's not something we want to do here, because chances are you don't know swift.

15
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.780
You don't know Java.

16
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.530
And the good thing is for all the common interactions you want to have with your device.

17
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.830
So things like working with maps or working with the camera, you got packages which you can install

18
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.770
that take all the heavy lifting away from you and just give you a couple of dart methods you can call.

19
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.160
Q will open a camera to open maps and so on.

20
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.790
There are official packages managed by the flutter team and tons of inofficial ones managed by the community.

21
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.660
And if you search for image underscored picker here on popped up.

22
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.140
Def.

23
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.540
You'll find a couple of plugins that help you with selecting images and definitely feel free to explore

24
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.710
them all the one.

25
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.080
All use is the image picker plug in here.

26
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.860
This is a great plug in, which makes it very easy to work with the device camera selector image or

27
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.960
take an image and then work with that image.

28
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.600
It has detailed installation docs here.

29
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.790
And as always, the installation starts by going to the installing tap here and copying that dependency

30
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.980
and then simply go into your perspective.

31
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.550
YAML file here and there, add it and then save it.

32
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.860
And as always, it fetches this automatically.

33
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.700
If it doesn't run, flatter packages get into terminal after navigating into this project here.

34
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.160
So with that added here, we can start using this package to open to camera.

35
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.970
So here, an image input dart you now can import.

36
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.700
A package with Package Colen, and it's the image picture package and Darity, the image picker darte

37
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.120
filed with dead, added, you can go down here Tudor's function, which is triggered when this flat

38
00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.110
button is pressed.

39
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.360
And there I now want to start taking my image nose's.

40
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.930
We have a bit more code in there.

41
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.120
I'll actually use a named method here, a named function of.

42
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.560
This is a Bidwill nicer to read.

43
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.820
Our code is a bit more structured and I'll name it.

44
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.550
Picture.

45
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.580
And I'll come back to the typed his returns in a second.

46
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.440
And in here I'll use Image Picker and we don't instantiate this.

47
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.240
Instead, you use this as a clause which provides a couple of static methods.

48
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.480
If you click on it, you see it has static methods in there, like the PIC image method and you already

49
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.930
see this.

50
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.880
This will return a future so you can call pic image here to open the camera and take an image.

51
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.240
And this returns a future because of course, dead will take a while to finish, at least until the

52
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.240
user pressed the camera button and confirmed the image.

53
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.490
So here we'll get back a future.

54
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.220
And therefore I want to use async await.

55
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.570
And therefore here will return a future.

56
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.570
Here, however, a future which won't yield anything.

57
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.320
But here, I, of course, want to await for this image to be taken.

58
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.970
And then we'll have the image file as a response here.

59
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.470
Whipsnade, that should be final.

60
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.320
So in the end, after the image took and confirmed, the image will have a image file here.

61
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.470
Now, there is an important note to take, though, if you are using image picker in Syria on six or

62
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.870
seven or higher.

63
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.820
So if you're not using the six dot five or anything like that, then this syntax changes slightly or

64
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.990
you can change it.

65
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.870
You can still use the syntax to show you here.

66
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.680
But alternatively, you can now also instantiate the image picker to create the image picker.

67
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.090
So actually, you would store does in a new final constant then.

68
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.230
And the on this picker you can call get image now to get image.

69
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.520
You will still be able to pass to exact same arguments.

70
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.920
I'm now going to pass over the next minutes.

71
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.150
So that does not change.

72
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:13.080
But how you trigger that image picking process that changed, you instantiate and then call get image

73
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.680
on the instance instead of calling pig image as a static method.

74
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.350
It depends on the package words you're using.

75
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.470
And as I just said, you can also still use the other approach with the newer package wording, but

76
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.320
you might want to consider switching to that alternative.

77
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.100
I just showed you now pick image needs to be configured.

78
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.710
You need to provide the source argument and define what your source for the image should be, because

79
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.400
there are two sources and you can use the image source enum for dad, which is provided by the image

80
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.540
picker package.

81
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.150
And there you have the camera or the gallery.

82
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.500
Now I want to use the camera.

83
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.510
But of course you could also use the gallery instead to let the user will take an image from their.

84
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.820
And another argument you can define is the max height or max width and all restrict the image or automatically

85
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.730
crop it to a max width of 600.

86
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.190
So did our image isn't too big.

87
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.920
Because, of course, modern phones really have high resolution cameras and you therefore shoot large

88
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.520
images.

89
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.070
And for this app, we don't need such a large image.

90
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.730
So to save some space on the device and also speed up our app.

91
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:26.000
You should, of course, ensure that you only take images in a size that you really need and don't take

92
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.150
high resolution images if your app doesn't need them.

93
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.100
If it does, of course do so.

94
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.590
So your debt will now configure the image I want to take it will take the image and thereafter it will

95
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.310
store it here.

96
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.240
An image file.

97
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.830
Now, let's hook up the take picture method here to this button, so point at.

98
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.740
Take picture without parentheses.

99
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.120
Don't want to execute this method when the code gets passed, but instead when the user presses the

100
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.600
button.

101
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.200
And with all of that, we're almost there.

102
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.500
But one super important thing is missing.

103
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.740
Often when working with native device features like a camera or with the user location, you need to

104
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.240
ask for permission before you use these features and therefore you need to add some extra setup.

105
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.490
And you see that also in the package here in the Read Me file.

106
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:21.510
And basically, whenever you're working with a package that leverages some native the wise feature which

107
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.410
needs permissions.

108
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.110
The official documentation should tell you about that.

109
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.590
So the official docs year Florida plug ins you're using are always worth having a look at because they

110
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.190
tell you what you need to configure for this package to work correctly.

111
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.860
Of course, you should not just check the read me for packages that use native to wise features.

112
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:46.560
You should actually read the read before all packages you're using, but especially for packages that

113
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.880
use native device features.

114
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.060
You should have a look so that you don't miss any setup.

115
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.970
And here we get extra hints on how to configure this for ISDN and for Android and for Android.

116
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.790
As you see, we need no extra Quantic.

117
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.160
But for us, we do there.

118
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.960
We need to add it the info P list file in the Iowa as a runner folder.

119
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.330
Now, if you're on Windows or Linux, you won't have an ISIS folder because you can't build ISIS apps

120
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:12.630
there.

121
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:18.450
But if you are on Mac OS, make sure you go to the Iowas folder in your flutter project and dear to

122
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.920
the runner folder and then to invoke P list info.

123
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.930
P list is a consideration file for the Aiwass app, where you set up things like a weird number of the

124
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:34.980
app, but also some permissions you need and to text you want to show in the permission prompts which

125
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:40.380
I os automatically shows to the user when the user is about to use the camera.

126
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.400
Use the location.

127
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.360
Anything like that.

128
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.960
So here you see free keys, which you should add.

129
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:51.360
So just copy that name and then in here you can pick any place.

130
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.180
Maybe here.

131
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.170
Above that key, you launch story, but name a story board name.

132
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.950
So right next to such a key entry, not between key and string or a key or whatever, because these

133
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.290
entries always belong together.

134
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.520
You have a key and then that's the value for the key.

135
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.200
So don't enter your new entry between such a key value pair.

136
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.550
But instead, add a new key here with these opening and closing elements here key.

137
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:28.930
And then again, key with a forward slash between the angle brackets and then enter that key, which

138
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.550
you got from the official box.

139
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:36.580
And now the value here is a string because you enter some text which is displayed to the user when he

140
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.990
basically is about to use a feature that needs that permission.

141
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.880
So here does would be the permission you need when you want to use the gallery.

142
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.330
We're actually not using that, so we technically don't need this.

143
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.720
But in case you want to use the gallery, add this permission.

144
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.890
That's why I'm showing it here.

145
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.230
So here you can display.

146
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.360
Any text that, well, gets to user to confirm this or give you the permission.

147
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:07.690
So we need to take a picture, maybe you provide a more meaningful text than that.

148
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.090
But I think you're getting the idea here.

149
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:16.500
So a never permission, which we need to add for our app here certainly is to camera usage description.

150
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.790
You need Dad when you want to use the camera.

151
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.650
Alice showed the same text here.

152
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.250
You could enter a different text, of course, and then here the microphone use such.

153
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.310
You only need that if you want to take a video where you will also record the audio.

154
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.610
We're definitely not doing that here, so we don't need to set this up.

155
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.990
So this year, the camera key.

156
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.440
That's the important one for us.

157
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.050
If you want to use the gallery, yours need that.

158
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.760
And if you want to record videos, you also should ask for permission to record the audio.

159
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.340
With dad, we're all set for.

160
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.180
I was asked the official docs state.

161
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.440
We don't need a special setup for Android.

162
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.230
So with that, we should now be able to press that button.

163
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.740
Let's do a full refresh and then let's see whether that works.

164
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.480
Let's go here to the ad plays, screen click, take picture.

165
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.840
And I'm actually getting an error here.

166
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.120
No implementation found for method pig image on channel plug ins.

167
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.720
Now, this should be a problem that can be solved by closing our process and fully rebuilding a restarting

168
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.130
the app.

169
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:29.460
Simply because we added a plug in that's taps into native device functionalities that can sometimes

170
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.130
lead to problems, so let's do a full restart here.

171
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.360
And now let's go back to that at lace screen click, take picture again.

172
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.890
And now it does opens up the camera here.

173
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.180
Now, the first time you launched as you get this info screen here.

174
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.200
So let's go back in that case here.

175
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.090
Leave the camera.

176
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.360
And let's press it again.

177
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.830
Camera opens up again.

178
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.540
Now, here we can take a picture.

179
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.440
And confirmed as with the check market.

180
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.950
We're happy this close, this deal camera.

181
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.980
And now we got a handle to that image.

182
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.990
It's now stored in that variable.

183
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:08.060
But of course, now we need to do something with that variable to save it on our local device in the

184
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.080
fall system there.
