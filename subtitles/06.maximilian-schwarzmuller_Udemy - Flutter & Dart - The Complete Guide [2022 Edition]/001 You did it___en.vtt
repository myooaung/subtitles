00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.250
Great job.

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:03.760
You did it,

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.930
you finished the course and in this course, you learned a lot about Flutter.

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.380
How to build apps with it, how to work with widgets, which different kinds of widgets you have,

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.780
how to compose complex user interfaces from widgets, how to communicate between widgets, how to manage

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.780
state, how to navigate, how to use native device features like the camera or maps or on device storage

7
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.410
and so much more.

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.310
You learned a lot about Flutter and you now have a lot of tools that should help you build amazing applications.

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.320
Now in the next two videos in this module here, I'll round this course up and show you some potential

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.830
next steps you could take to make you an even better Flutter developer and explain how you could dive

11
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.080
deeper and what my recommendations would be and I then also want to layout kind of a blueprint,

12
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.800
a basic plan for how you could approach future apps you might be building, generally an idea of the different

13
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.750
phases app development has and how you might want to think about these phases.

14
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.070
I hope that's helpful

15
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.610
and it was fun having you as a student,

16
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.360
thanks for being part of the course.
