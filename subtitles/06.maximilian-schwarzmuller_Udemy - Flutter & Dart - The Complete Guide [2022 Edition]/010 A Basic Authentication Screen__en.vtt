WEBVTT

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.230
So now that we saw the real time functionality of Firebase in action and now that we saw how we can

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.240
connect our flutter app with help of the Firebase SDK to firebase the service, which just to make this

3
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.170
clear again, is totally decoupled from flutter.

4
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.300
It works with Web apps, with native Android apps.

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.130
It works with a bunch of other apps as well.

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.270
But we can also use it with Flutter through that SDK.

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.710
So now that we made this to work, let's take a step back.

8
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.900
We don't need to chat screen right now.

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.780
We need the off screen instead because we want to build an application where users have to authenticate

10
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.180
before they can chat.

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.720
So let's go to the off screen dart file and let's create a new widget in there.

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.050
And that should be a state full widget now.

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.800
So make sure you create that stateful widget class here and the state class that belongs to it.

14
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.460
And here I'm using the shortcut where I can type stuff in visuals to decode.

15
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.530
And then I get this suggestion.

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.850
And by clicking tab or by hitting tap, this is generated and you're all named as off screen.

17
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.970
And you see it enters this in all the relevant places.

18
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.980
And I will also import material material that dart from the flutter package.

19
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.330
And now here I want to render my well, guess what, my off screen.

20
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.170
For that.

21
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.540
Here, instead of rendering a container, all render a scaffold because I want to have a nice background

22
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.700
and so on, and I will set the background color of this page, not to the default to this grayish white

23
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.080
look, but instead I want to use my primary color here and with theme of context, primary color.

24
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.140
We get access to that as you learn from the course.

25
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.380
Now for the body off the scaffold here, of course, I want you to display some form.

26
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.340
So in the end, a forum where the user can enter the email, the password and the user name, and later

27
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.040
also take an image.

28
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.130
That's the goal here.

29
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.010
For that forum, I'll use the center widget to have a well centered widget and the child of that center

30
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.120
widget could be a card, and that's another widget that comes with flutter.

31
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:35.480
And on the card, I'll set the margin on the card constructor here to EDG INSETs, all 20 to have a

32
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.540
little bit of margin around the cards, a little bit of empty space and the child of the card.

33
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.680
So the content inside of the card should be a single child scroll view, a single child, scroll views

34
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.150
so that we can scroll if the form elements should take up too much space so that we never have a situation

35
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.880
where one of the elements is unreachable and inside of that single child scroll view.

36
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.460
On the other hand, I want to have some padding, so I'll use the padding widget here and set the padding

37
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.150
to etch INSETs all 16.

38
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.560
And these are just some values that I picked in advance that should look nice.

39
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.570
Of course, you can use different values here and play around with different values.

40
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.190
I'll take 16 as a padding here and then a child of the padding widget here is the actual form widget,

41
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.810
which will soon include all the form fields.

42
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.120
Now I'll just restructure this to make this a bit easier to read.

43
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.640
And this is the widget tree we have thus far.

44
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.930
Now, I can already tell that this form will be a bit longer.

45
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.790
We'll have multiple form elements in there and therefore I'll do one thing.

46
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.840
I'll actually grab this entire center widget here and cut it.

47
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.620
And then the widgets folder, I'll add a new folder.

48
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.910
And in that new all folder I will add my auth.

49
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.270
For him, the dart file, so did I basically outsourced is off for him into a separate widget just to

50
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.260
make each widget on its own a little bit more manageable and a little bit smaller.

51
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.350
Now, the off form widget will also managed a different input states of the user and therefore does

52
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.640
actually also will be stateful widget.

53
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.910
For example, we will need to be able to switch between, log in and sign up mode and update DUI respectively.

54
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.160
So we need to manage some state in here.

55
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.690
Hence does this the off form and we need to import material to start from clutter again.

56
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.010
And here, instead of returning a container, I will return my center, which is so the content I just

57
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:58.660
cut from the off screen and therefore here in the off screen file as a body, I can render this off

58
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.260
form.

59
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.720
Now again, I just split this into two widgets to make each widget a bit more manageable.

60
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.000
Will, of course, also add some logic to have those widgets communicate with each other.

61
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.670
So make sure you add this import to the off form dard file and let's go back to the forum and work on

62
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.250
that form.

63
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.430
Now, the form itself will have a couple of children.

64
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.150
Of course, it can only have one child, but this child can be a column.

65
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.240
And now we are able to define a couple of children, which are all part of that form.

66
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.280
Now, I want to make sure that this column actually takes only as little space as it needs so that it

67
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.070
doesn't take all available space, but that it basically just takes the space its children need.

68
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.920
So I'll set the main axis size of this column widget to main exercise dot min.

69
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.820
This makes sure that the column does not take as much as possible, but only as much as needed.

70
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.420
Now to define how much space is needed and to have all the inputs we need in the children here in this

71
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.180
list inside of the column, I now want to render all the text form fields we need.

72
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.790
So here we can add the first text from field for, let's say, our email.

73
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:27.680
And a second text for him field thereafter for the username and a third text form field for the password,

74
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.710
that will not always need all of them, but that will generally be the fields we need.

75
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.960
Of course, will also add image upload later, though.

76
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.730
Now, let's start with that first text worm field here.

77
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:48.830
We want to take the email address of the user, so I'll set the keyboard type here to text input type

78
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:55.040
dot, email type dot, email address so that we present the right keyboard.

79
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.470
We can also set the declaration of this text form field, because as you'll learn in discourse with

80
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.610
the declaration configuration here, you are able to set the label.

81
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:12.540
For example, declaration takes an object of type input declaration, hence will use this constructor

82
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.920
to create such an object.

83
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.320
And there we can now set the label text to email address.

84
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.360
And if we want also the label style, for example, to be bold.

85
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.780
I'll not do that here though.

86
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.730
But of course you could.

87
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.170
And in general you can, of course, style this entirely in the way you want.

88
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:39.300
This year is the first text from field, it's missing a bunch of things, of course, and will soon

89
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.850
add more logic, but this is the base configuration, the minimal configuration of one.

90
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:52.320
Now on the next text from field in line here, I want to get the username so there for a year.

91
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.760
I'm fine with the default keyboard's type.

92
00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:00.530
We don't need to set a different type, but I want to set a decoration so that we can actually set the

93
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.040
label.

94
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:07.250
So here the label text is username to make it clear which kind of input we're expecting here.

95
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:16.630
And then the third text worm field also takes a declaration where we can set the label text to password

96
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.510
and now important since this is a password, I also want to make sure that the input of the user is

97
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.930
hidden.

98
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:30.910
And we can do that by setting the obscure text configuration or argument on the text form field constructor

99
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:31.930
to true.

100
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.390
And this will highlight the text entered by the user.

101
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:43.539
Now, below all these text from fields, I'll add a SIST box, which is a box that we can use to insert

102
00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.310
some space and I'll set the height here to 12.

103
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:54.190
I'm doing this because below that I want to add a race button, which in the end allows the user to

104
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.180
submit this form.

105
00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:02.380
So the child of this button is a text widget where we can simply say log in, though we will also set

106
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.230
this text dynamically soon.

107
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:12.160
We also should add on prest here to define the function that should execute when the button is pressed

108
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.170
and right now does, it's just an empty dummy function because we don't have the final logic yet.

109
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.790
And with that, I'm done with this button right below it.

110
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.810
I will also add a flat button.

111
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:29.000
This should be the button we use for switching between log in and sign up mode.

112
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:37.650
So here the child is actually a text where I say, for example, create new account.

113
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.180
This text will also soon be set dynamically.

114
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:46.780
And I want to also add on prest here and do nothing at the moment.

115
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.440
OK, cool.

116
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.180
So that's the basic off for him, which does nothing but which we should be able to see.

117
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:59.740
So let's go to the main dart file and instead of the chat screen here on home, let's load the off screen

118
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.330
and make sure you therefore also add the import to the off screen here.

119
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:11.960
We can also keep the chat screen import because we will need that later again, if you now safe everything,

120
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.090
you should see that log in screen here and that doesn't look too shabby.

121
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.940
But I want to use different colors here.

122
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.910
So let's work on the theming in the next lecture.
