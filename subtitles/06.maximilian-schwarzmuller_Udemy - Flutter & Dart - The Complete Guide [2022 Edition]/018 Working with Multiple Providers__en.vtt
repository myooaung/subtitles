00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:10.130
To start using that card here, let's first of all, think about where we need it later, we'll need

2
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.680
it in the product overview screen because they're in the app bar next to the pop up menu button here

3
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.140
and the app or I want to add a cart icon which is displayed up there, which we can click or tap to

4
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.170
go to the card screen where we see all the card entries.

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.350
And on that card, I can I also want to show a label that shows us how many items are in the card.

6
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.040
So we'll need information about the card here in the product's overview screen.

7
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.500
We also need access to the card from inside the product item darte file, because there we have that

8
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.910
shopping cart button here.

9
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.200
This one, which allows us to add items to CART.

10
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.810
And that, of course, means that we need access to our card provider and will later also have a separate

11
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.070
card screen, which shows us or which allows us to see what's in the card.

12
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.740
So we also need to access the card from in there.

13
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.220
Hence the card is another thing that makes sense to be provided in our route widget because we need

14
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.580
it in a couple of screens which are defined up there as well.

15
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.080
Now the problem is we already have a provider here.

16
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:19.400
Now, of course, we could have a nested change notifier provider in here and simply provide our card

17
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.950
here as a value would be possible, wouldn't be wrong, wouldn't hurt performance, but gets pretty

18
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.300
ugly the more and more providers we add because we have a deeper and deeper nesting.

19
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.760
Thankfully, the provider package has covered.

20
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.770
It gives us a special type of provider which allows us to group multiple providers together.

21
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.320
And that's the multi provider.

22
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.040
Multi provider is a clause you can create if you import from the provider provider package and multi

23
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.930
provider takes a provider's argument, which is a list of providers.

24
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.400
Now to.

25
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.560
That providers list, you simply add your providers like this change notifier provider value.

26
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.340
Of course, close to that extra parentheses.

27
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.240
And added parentheses here after providers.

28
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.870
And you're good, so you simply have providers and next to that, then your child, which will simply

29
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.600
receive all these providers.

30
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.390
So in child here, you can tap into all providers you set up up there.

31
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.270
So now you have one change notifier provider here with no child here, it will simply get this child.

32
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.010
And we can add another one here now, which receives our card.

33
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.680
And for dad, we just have to make sure that we import the card mallord a card class.

34
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.590
So from the providers file from cards dard, we need to import this.

35
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.770
And with that import added, we can set up this change, notify the provider at the closing parentheses

36
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.570
and we're good.

37
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.680
So now we're adding these two providers to the entire child widget tree down there.

38
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.100
That means we can now listen to card anywhere in the application.

39
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.980
Now, again, stepping in here from the future, as I mentioned earlier, the recommended way of solving

40
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.820
this year when you provide a brand new object is that you don't use the value constructor, but instead

41
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.380
the create function in the default constructor of change notifier provider, which simply looks like

42
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.770
this.

43
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.950
And you should do this for products and also for the card.

44
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.520
So that would be the recommended the best practice approach, the above approach, all the works fine

45
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.930
here.

46
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.560
But again, as I mentioned earlier, that is to current best practice of doing it.

47
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.480
Hence, of course, I want to show this here.
