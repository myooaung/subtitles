00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.720
I'm quite happy with our current state but in the transaction list as I mentioned, of course you can

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.730
keep your custom list item here which we built

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:20.250
if you prefer that, I want to show you an alternative though and that alternative, here instead of using

4
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.130
a card with our custom stylings and our custom setup, that alternative is a widget built into Flutter

5
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.960
which you often use in conjunction with lists but you don't have to use it in conjunction

6
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.250
and that would be a ListTile widget. Again, that's built into Flutter and that's a nicely preconfigured

7
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.490
and styled widget with a certain layout that fits particularly well into lists. On your list

8
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.360
tile, you can set up a couple of things,

9
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.440
for example you can set up a leading widget which means a widget that is positioned at the beginning

10
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.600
of that ListTile

11
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.790
and there, we could use yet another built-in widget,

12
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.190
the CircleAvatar, which is a rounded widget that can hold a content often, it's used to hold images but

13
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.830
here we'll use it to hold our amount spent

14
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.520
and it simply looks nice.

15
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.380
So here, we can assign a radius of let's say 30, that defines how rounded it is and give it a child and

16
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.360
that child here can be our text with our transaction amount.

17
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.690
So again, here using a dollar sign which we want to output and therefore which we escape and then a dollar

18
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:45.670
sign for our string interpolation where I use transactions for the given index and there, the amount

19
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.730
and if we save that, now our list items look like this. For very long numbers, it's not looking that great

20
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
and therefore, you learned what we can do,

21
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.480
we can wrap this with a new widget and that could be our FittedBox here

22
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.150
and if we wrap that with a FittedBox, now longer items shrink a bit.

23
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.700
Now still some spacing would be nice and therefore we can then also wrap our FittedBox here with

24
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:28.480
another widget, with a padding widget and give it a padding of let's say EdgeInsets.all 10 maybe,

25
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.360
a bit too much,

26
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.870
let's go with 6

27
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.770
and yes, super big numbers really don't look that good but it's unrealistically huge number for

28
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.160
this app,

29
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.230
so this should be fine.

30
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.020
So that's our leading part but of course that's not all that should be output on the ListTile.

31
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.820
Besides the leading element, we can also have a title, which is an element in the middle and there, I'd

32
00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:04.920
like to have my text with my transaction title. Now we can also set a style and again, I'll get that style

33
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.560
here from my theme.

34
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.920
So here I want to get my text theme and there,

35
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.790
the title theme and it's not i but index.

36
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.380
If we add this here, this title assignment with our text widget using the title theme, then we have

37
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.970
the title again. Besides the title,

38
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.030
you can also add a subtitle to the list tile which is basically some text shown below the title.

39
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.370
So here again I want to show some text and there, I'll refer to transactions index and then my date.

40
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.270
Date of course is a datetime,

41
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.630
I want to have a human readable date and therefore here, I'll use date format for this formatted with a year,

42
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:56.460
a long month and then a day and then I call format and pass that date as a value to generate a string

43
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.910
based on that date and with this adjustment, we now have the date below that and you're hopefully seeing

44
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.010
how this is taking shape.

45
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.010
Now we could even add a trailing element, so an element at the end of that ListTile and often there you

46
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.410
have buttons, icon buttons like a trash icon for deleting the item and so on

47
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.340
but for here, the only thing I want to do here, I want to wrap this into a card

48
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.750
actually and on that card, I'll set up some margin in all directions,

49
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:42.110
actually not in all directions but symmetrically in the vertical direction 8 and in the horizontal direction,

50
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.500
maybe 5, a bit less, so there is some spacing between the list items as well and a little background color

51
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.980
and I'll also add an elevation of 5 here to every card.

52
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.700
And now with that, this is how the transactions look like, not too shabby and up there,

53
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.690
we have our chart. Now of course, feel free to fine tune this a bit more if you prefer a different look,

54
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.290
I will also revisit the general layout, for example that we have this empty space down there, I'm not

55
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.600
too happy about that. We'll fix this later once we learned how to work with the device size and how to

56
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.790
find out how big the device is we're running on. For the moment, let's leave it as it is and let's indeed

57
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.310
have a look at how we can adjust our app to different device sizes and also to different operating systems,

58
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.260
namely Android and iOS.
