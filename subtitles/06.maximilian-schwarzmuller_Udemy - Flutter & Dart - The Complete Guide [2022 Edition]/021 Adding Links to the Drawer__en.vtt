00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.100
With the drawer added, let's now make sure we actually switch to different pages when we tap on these items

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.880
here. For that,

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.630
back in the main drawer, of course here when we tap, I want to switch the page.

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.310
Now what happens exactly upon tapping of course depends on which ListTile you're on,

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:30.410
so actually I expect a third argument here which should be of type function which is the tap handler,

6
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.880
whatever you want to name it.

7
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.340
So this should be a function we pass into build ListTile

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.800
and that's what I assign here to onTap.

9
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.960
So this is the function which should be triggered when this ListTile gets tapped

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.710
and now since this is an extra argument, we have to pass it to buildListTile when we call it down there.

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.110
So for the first ListTile, I'll add an anonymous function for the second function, for the second list

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.760
tile here, I'll do it as well.

13
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.430
Now for meals, I want to go to my TabsScreen here.

14
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.840
Now this TabsScreen also has a routeName

15
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.970
since it's our default route, it has just slash as an identifier. So here for restaurant, I want to go with

16
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.600
navigator of context,

17
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.080
I want to go to my /route. For that,

18
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.520
we can use pushNamed and go to just slash, right,

19
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.100
that's what we learned before. For filters, we need to add a new screen which I'll do here,

20
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:43.990
I'll name it FiltersScreen and there, I'll add a stateless widget named FiltersScreen, as always imports

21
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.910
material.dart

22
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.850
and then here instead of having that container, I'll output my centered text

23
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.200
filters and of course, we'll add more meaningful content later.

24
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.430
So the FiltersScreen now also should have its own routeName,

25
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.270
so let's add a static const here, routeName

26
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.330
as we have it on our other screens as well

27
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.860
and that could be /filters

28
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.500
and with that, we can register it in the main.dart file here in our routes table.

29
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.790
We have that filters

30
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.240
screen here, so this widget

31
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.410
and for that we need to add an import here at the top of course,

32
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.000
so import ./screens/filters_screen.dart. So now we access FiltersScreen here

33
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.120
dot, I seem to have a typo here, yes this should be FiltersScreen of course, not filter screen.

34
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.580
So now it's FiltersScreen.routeName and then we have the builder function which will build us a

35
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.520
FiltersScreen like that.

36
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.250
So now it's registered in the route table,

37
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.810
now in the drawer we can use it because here for the filters ListTile, we can now use navigator of

38
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:17.070
context pushNamed and now use FiltersScreen and for that, import that screen here as well, so import

39
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.180
from the screens folder, the FiltersScreen file. So filters_screen.dart is imported and now down there,

40
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.520
we can push FiltersScreen.routeName.

41
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.810
Now I'm not using that screen class.routeName approach for our main route because I think just

42
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.090
slash is hard to mistype, so here just using this hardcoded string should be fine

43
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.640
but of course you could implement this routeName constant in the TabsScreen as well if you wanted to.

44
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.800
So with that, we are able to go to different pages here,

45
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.730
let's see it in action.

46
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.860
If I tap meals, here I'm in meals, if I go to filters, I'm on filters and I forgot the scaffold

47
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.230
but generally, navigation works.
