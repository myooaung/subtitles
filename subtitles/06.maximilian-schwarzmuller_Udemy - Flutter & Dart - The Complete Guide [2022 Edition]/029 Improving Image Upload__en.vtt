00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:10.040
The image upload is working our images here, but now I want easy to use, you are of which we can store

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.040
here in our users collection and which we can then use in our message bubble to show the image of a

3
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.440
user who sent the message.

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.860
Now, getting such a you are l is thankfully very, very easy.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.150
Once we uploaded this, we can use our rep here again.

6
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.520
And on the graph you can call get download.

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.090
You are well and this returns a future or gives you a future that will actually retrieve a long lived.

8
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.010
You are l which is usable by anyone who has that you url to view that image.

9
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.870
And it's great because that means that in the future we don't have to use the firebase storage package

10
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.860
to scan through all our files and find to file for a specific user.

11
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.870
Instead, we can just store a direct link to the image for every user.

12
00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:02.060
So let's await this and we should get the you are all here in the end once it is resolved so that you

13
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.860
are less than what I want to the word here.

14
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.460
In my users collection, so is stored on file with firebase storage, but in my extra user data, I

15
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.160
store a pointer, a u r l to that file.

16
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.100
So image, you are all here can just be that you are elbridge for getting with get download you Earl.

17
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.990
And at this hopefully does the trick, if we safeness and we try this one more time, if a logout and

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.440
we create a brand new account.

19
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.510
With some valid data here, we had an image.

20
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.120
And click sign up.

21
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.740
The sign up process.

22
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.440
Is active and eventually finishes, and if we now go back to the FIREBASE Web console.

23
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.450
To the database.

24
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.710
And to users.

25
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.600
You see that I have this image, you URL for the user I just added, and if you grab that yourself and

26
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.880
enter it in the browser, it loads this image.

27
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.520
So that's a direct you URL to that image, which is great because that means we can always use that

28
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.690
you are able to load and previewed its image.

29
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.620
We don't have to use the FIREBASE Storage SDK to kind of scan all files.

30
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.490
The one thing you might also notice, though, is that on storage, you see that the files are relatively

31
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.600
large here, around 200 kilobytes.

32
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.250
And if you are using a high resolution camera, that might be even bigger.

33
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.190
And that's way too big for an image, which I'll just show here next to the jet message.

34
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.380
I don't need such a huge image here.

35
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.470
So in order to save storage and in order to make sure that this all loads and uploads fast, I actually

36
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.110
will go back to the user image picker where we call pic image on the image picture package.

37
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.780
And besides the source, we can, for example, also set the image quality here and set this to 50.

38
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.720
It should be a value between zero and one hundred and I'll set it to 50, which is a way worse quality

39
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.170
but should still be good enough.

40
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.120
We can also set a max width and height here to ensure that this is not too large.

41
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.440
And since I only need a tiny image, I'll set the max with to 150.

42
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.720
So this should not actually give us a much smaller image, which is way faster to upload and Weismuller

43
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.400
to store.

44
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.120
So if we give data try, we log out and create yet another new user.

45
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.440
You're.

46
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.530
Let's take a image.

47
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.100
If ANAO sign up, you see, that is faster.

48
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.700
It doesn't take as long to upload and we also see it here.

49
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.940
If I reload, the other images have around 200 kilobytes.

50
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.340
This image has just three kilobytes.

51
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.230
And of course, it has a worse quality, but that should be fine and we can always fine tune this later,

52
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.470
but we certainly don't need high resolution, super large image if we're just going to use a tiny image

53
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.829
here.

54
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.810
Now, that's the next point, though.

55
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.410
I want to make sure we do display the image here.

56
00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.810
And for that I will actually clear all my images.

57
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.980
I currently have your.

58
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.870
So if we start from scratch and it will also clear all the database data.

59
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.880
So everything here and chat by deleting the entire chat collection, everything in chats by deleting

60
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.930
this collection.

61
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.700
And everything in users by deleting this collection and of course, that means will also delete all

62
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.490
users here under authentication, and I'm simply doing this to start from scratch now that we added

63
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.020
all those core functionalities when it comes to creating users.

64
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.640
And I also then want to test this on.

65
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.020
I was on a real iOS device before we thereafter continue to show the image preview and then all the

66
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.760
work on the push notifications.
