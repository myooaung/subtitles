00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.480
So now that we know what Flutter is or that we at least have a rough idea about that,

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.610
let's have a look at the architecture of a Flutter application and there, the most important thing

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.540
which you'll see over and over throughout the course is that Flutter has that idea of building user interfaces

4
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.770
as code,

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.220
that's called UI as Code. You build a widget tree in your Flutter apps and I'll come back to that

6
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.130
in a second,

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.780
in the end the idea is that you will have no visual drag and drop editor for adding buttons or text

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.570
inputs to your screens, to what the user sees,

9
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.500
instead you'll work only in code, we'll write everything in code

10
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.450
and whilst this might sound intimidating at first,

11
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.020
you will see the Flutter has a really nice approach for that, which makes creating interfaces with this

12
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.080
UI as Code approach a breeze.

13
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.740
Now besides this core idea of how you build your apps in Flutter, this UI as Code approach, it's also

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.680
important to understand that Flutter apps do actually embrace platform differences, whilst being based

15
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.090
on one codebase.

16
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.930
So we work in one project but we will still have the ability to create different user interfaces at

17
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.790
some points or in some parts of our app if we need it for the different platforms

18
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.060
because Android and iOS are not exactly the same.

19
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.180
They're not just for different phones,

20
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
they do have some small differences and sometimes, that doesn't matter to you

21
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.610
but if it does, Flutter gives you the tools to find out on which platform you're running, so that if

22
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.060
you're on Android, you can execute code A

23
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.410
and if you're on iOS, you can execute code B, so Flutter gives you the full flexibility there.

24
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.380
Now let's first of all have a look at that widget thing again.

25
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.240
In Flutter,

26
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.100
everything's a widget, that's important to understand.

27
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.540
If you had an app that looks like this, then this is a bunch of widgets. For example here,

28
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.040
the app bar at the top with the tabs in there,

29
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.270
that's one huge widget with a lot of smaller widgets in there and all these elements on the screen are

30
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.890
just widgets in the end,

31
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.440
you build your entire screen, your entire app from such widgets.

32
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.740
Actually the whole page is a widget

33
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.080
and even the whole app is wrapped in one main widget and a widget as you will see throughout this course

34
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.230
is really just a code snippet, an instruction you placed in your code, something like Please render a button

35
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.500
here,

36
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.410
that's a widget,

37
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.260
it'll be as simple as that and your entire app is therefore built as a widget tree.

38
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.110
You have this root widget which is your app itself, then you might have different screens there, on

39
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.420
the different screens, you have different sections and in there you might have text inputs, text outputs,

40
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.430
buttons, tabs, drop downs and a widget might hold other widgets, for example your tabs widget might hold

41
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.960
individual tab widgets

42
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.260
but thinking about this in an abstract way can be really difficult and therefore for now, just keep that

43
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.170
term "widget tree" in mind,

44
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.250
we'll have a look at how this works and how this looks and we'll actually write all the code for that

45
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.160
together throughout the

46
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.590
course. Now this UI as Code concept is also important,

47
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.470
if you had an application that looks like this here, then as I mentioned earlier, you don't build it by

48
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.460
dragging and dropping elements into a visual editor,

49
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.690
you have no visual editor indeed,

50
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.280
instead you only work in code.

51
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.430
The code for this could look like that here and here you already get a brief preview at how these widgets

52
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.320
work and how you structure your entire app with the help of these widgets, how you configure your app

53
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.510
with these widgets

54
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.730
and as you can see, even without understanding that code, that probably doesn't look too difficult. In

55
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.030
the end,

56
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.650
here we just have a bunch of instructions on what should get rendered on the screen and how the different

57
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.000
things are related

58
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.480
and of course you'll learn all about that throughout the course.

59
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.530
So this is extremely straightforward way of building your app

60
00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.210
and I will introduce you to this approach carefully step-by-step.

61
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.250
We'll build our apps from scratch and I will introduce you to the core widgets and how they work together

62
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.560
step-by-step in this course. Now this one codebase thing or concept is also important to understand.

63
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.440
In the end, you will have a bunch of Dart files in your project and these will make up your application

64
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.680
and you build a Android and an iOS app based on that one project

65
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.010
but as I mentioned, if you need to, you can still find out on which platform you are running and then

66
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.310
render different content based on that platform.

67
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.380
So these are the core Flutter ideas,

68
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.070
again if they're not 100% clear at this point, that's normal,

69
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.150
we just started,

70
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.060
we'll of course use all these features and go through all these features step-by-step as we progress through

71
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.600
the course.
