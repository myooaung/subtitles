00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.820
Now with the application taking a lot of shape, it's time to finally work on a chart because that's the

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.850
ugly piece that really doesn't fit into our application at all.

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.590
Now for that, let's add a new widget and I'll name it

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.430
chart.dart file because it will in the end display a chart about our recent transactions and that

5
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.490
can actually be a stateless widget because we won't need to change any data in there, it'll just output

6
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.730
some visual data about the transactions we added to our app.

7
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.480
I'll name the widget chart because in the end that is what it is

8
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.350
and of course just as a side note, there are official charting packages or third-party charting packages

9
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.430
you could add to Flutter projects if you need more complex charts

10
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.110
but that basic chart which we'll build here or that basic output we'll build here won't need such a package

11
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.110
but you can bring in such packages if you need more complex charting functionalities.

12
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.800
Now what do we need in here or how do we build this chart now?

13
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.240
I want to have that chart wrapped in a card and I'll give this card an elevation level of let's

14
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.210
say 6 to have a nice drop shadow

15
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.220
and on that card I also want to have a margin around so that there is some space around our chart. We

16
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.980
can add that with EdgeInsets as you learned

17
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.260
and I'll add a margin in all directions of let's say 20,

18
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260
we can always shrink that down if it's too much.

19
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.440
Now of course we need a child and that will be our actual chart

20
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.990
and for that, let's again analyze how such a chart should look like. It's time for my awesome drawing

21
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.380
skills again.

22
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.590
So in our application here right, we'll have that chart area here at the top

23
00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.080
and my idea here is that we have a couple of bars let's say for the last seven days,

24
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.490
so let's see if I can squeeze seven bars in here,

25
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.260
yes almost.

26
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.810
So we have seven bars here, one for each day in the last week, with some labels for the weekdays, so Monday,

27
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.430
Tuesday, Wednesday and so on,

28
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.160
so a single character for the weekday below that and above the amount of dollars that we spend on the

29
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.300
day, which can be zero if we spend nothing or

30
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.570
a different amount

31
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:37.400
if we spend something and then in that chart, I want to have or in that bar, I want to have some indication

32
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.330
of how much that amount that we spent on that day is of the total amount we spent on the overall week.

33
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.400
So if we spend 50 on Monday and 30 on Tuesday and 0 on all other days, then we had a total spending of

34
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.510
80, 50 plus 30

35
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.110
and here we have $50 of $80,

36
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.700
so we might have something like this, a significant amount above 50% of the bar

37
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.660
and here we might have $30 of $80 total spending,

38
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.540
so we're around a third of that bar.

39
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.700
That's my idea of how this should be structured.

40
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.160
Now what will we need here? This here, the red part,

41
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.170
that's our card,

42
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.500
we already have that.

43
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.750
Let me pick a different color, blue.

44
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.400
Now in that,

45
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.070
we'll certainly need a row and of course, that row does not go beyond the boundaries of the card,

46
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.050
I'm just drawing it like this so that you can see it,

47
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.980
so we need a row here for our different bars. Each bar,

48
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:59.810
so each bar here is then a column because we have the dollar sign, then the bar itself and then the label

49
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.260
and the bar inside of the bar so to say,

50
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.300
so that part here where we have that yellow filling, that of course again will be a container with a

51
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.600
partial background,

52
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.360
we'll see how we can draw, how we can fix this, how we can build this in Flutter.

53
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.459
So that's the rough layout,

54
00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.420
let's now build that.
