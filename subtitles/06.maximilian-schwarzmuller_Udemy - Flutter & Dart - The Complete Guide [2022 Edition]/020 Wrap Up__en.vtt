00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.240
So we're done with this module. As I just summarized,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.680
we added a couple of nice features which allow us to interact with the user, give the user a little bit

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.670
more control and also for example, interact with forms here, more complex forms where we have our own

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.580
validation and our own logic for checking whether things are working correctly.

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.950
We're now able to edit and add products here which of course isn't too bad

6
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.250
and with that, you learned about very important tools which you can use in pretty much any application

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.320
you build because you almost always interact with the users in some way

8
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:44.100
and that hopefully therefore helps you in your next applications. We'll now move on and we'll also learn

9
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.340
how we can now get data out of this local app here and store it on a server

10
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.210
and of course also fetch it from there.
