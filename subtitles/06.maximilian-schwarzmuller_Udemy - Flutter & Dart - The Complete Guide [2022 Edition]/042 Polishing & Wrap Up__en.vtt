00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.700
So now that the application is finished and all the features are integrated, it's time for some final

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.450
polishing.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.050
For example, there's one mistake I made in the chat screen.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.560
Last super and state should go to the beginning of that function, to the beginning of that method,

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.160
I should say.

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.930
It's not super bad.

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.970
As you saw, everything works, but it is a better practice to call this first.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.130
So make sure to put super in its state at the beginning in every in its state method you might have.

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.540
That's the first thing.

10
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.100
Now, in addition, here on the chat screen, it's hard to see here, but you might see it in your local

11
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.400
app.

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.050
There is a little gray bar at the bottom of this dropdown button here.

13
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.790
Now, if I go to the chat screen there, I have to drop down button.

14
00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.820
There is an underlying option, an underlying argument which we can set, and you might think that this

15
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.970
takes a number to define the width of the line at the bottom.

16
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.490
But actually, once a widget that will be rendered, as I underline, and you see that by default,

17
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.140
that's a 020 with Bordin border with India and grayish color.

18
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.070
Now, even though it has this width, it seems like we're seeing it here.

19
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.250
So let's try setting this to an empty container.

20
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.730
If ANAO now safety's is entirely gone.

21
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.970
So now we don't have to agree border anymore.

22
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.100
So that's another fix that makes sense here.

23
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:40.470
Now, if we do log out, we also got some issues or some potential improvements here on this log in

24
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.780
or sign up for him.

25
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.280
So let's go to that of forum here.

26
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.740
The the forum generally works, but these text fields could be configured a bit differently.

27
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.700
For example, on the email field here, I'm not too happy with how it behaves with a real keyboard,

28
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.300
to be precise.

29
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.590
I want to turn off auto correction here.

30
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.360
I always find this annoying on email addresses when it tries to fix what you entered.

31
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.150
I always want to control the text capitalization, which means how it tries to turn certain characters

32
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.840
to uppercase characters and the dare.

33
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.240
I want to set this to text capitalization non, which means it's not going to capitalize anything.

34
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.760
And with edible suggestions, fault's I'll also turn off any suggestions here, because I also find

35
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.520
this annoying on email addresses.

36
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.860
Now on the username here, that's a bit different there.

37
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.190
I want all the correction.

38
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.160
I want capitalization on a word level so that words are capitalized, let's say.

39
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.850
And I still don't want suggestions, though.

40
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.180
And of course, you can pick different settings, but these are the settings I'm going to choose.

41
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.730
Now for the password, everything seemed to work correctly for me, so I won't change anything, dear.

42
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.030
Now, with that, let me log in real quick here.

43
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.070
And all the work on that message field down there, because by default, this will only produce lowercase

44
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.600
words.

45
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.070
So we'll go to that chat screen.

46
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.680
No, to the new message widget.

47
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.560
I mean, and there we have that text field and on the text field, all said text capitalization to text

48
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.410
capitalization, let's say.

49
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.370
Sentences all turn on order corrections.

50
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.940
And I will also turn on these suggestions, so any suggestions set to true?

51
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.000
And was that if that rebuilds and I reload this app, if I tap into this again, you see now it starts

52
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.790
with a capital character and then I can type and only if I end a sentence, it starts with a new capital

53
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.260
character.

54
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.950
So Dad looks better to me as well.

55
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.650
And then there is one last thing, which is hard to see if you restart the app entirely.

56
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.470
So if I kill this year.

57
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:16.910
And restart the app, we briefly see the login screen before we are forwarded to the chat screen, and

58
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.030
the reason for that simply is that the FIREBASE authentication package needs a couple of milliseconds

59
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.010
to find out whether we have a valid token or not.

60
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.640
So, of course, that's also not ideal.

61
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.000
And therefore, at a new screen, I'll add a splash screen, which is essentially a loading screen.

62
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.760
I want to show whilst the authentication package is figuring out what's going on.

63
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.770
So that can be a simple statelets widget, which will name splash screen and where we need to import

64
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.570
material, Dodge Dart.

65
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.450
And here I simply want to render a scaffold so that we have a nice background and so on, where as a

66
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:06.320
body I simply have some centered text, let's say so simply some tank centered text where we say loading.

67
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.490
And of course, you could also show a loading spinner instead or do whatever you want.

68
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.310
You can show whatever you want here and now.

69
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.300
The idea is that we can show this splash screen instead of the chat or off screen, if we don't know

70
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.250
yet if the user is authenticated.

71
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.340
So we can simply go to Main Dart.

72
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:34.610
And here, before we check whether we have data, we can check on our user snapshot if the connection

73
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.700
state is equal to connection state waiting, which means we're still figuring out whether the user is

74
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.810
authenticated or not.

75
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.070
And if it is waiting, we just return the splash screen here.

76
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.090
And of course, for dad, you need to import to splash screen into that main dart file.

77
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.490
So now with that, I'm going to rerun this application.

78
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.550
And kill it first and now when it launches this application here, we hopefully now see the splash screen

79
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.980
instead of the flickering off screen.

80
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.250
So let's see what we get here.

81
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.920
And that looks better to me, there was the loading text for a fraction of a second before we were forwarded

82
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.260
here.

83
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.270
Now, I think another tiny improvement is that on the splash screen, on this scaffold, we maybe also

84
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.570
set the background color to our main theme, color to our primary color so that we have like this pinkish

85
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.280
background color there as well.

86
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.800
So it can now kill this.

87
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.270
And rebuild and rerun this year, we should now see that splash screen actually has this pinkish background

88
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.680
color.

89
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.400
Now that will not be our main application startup launch screen.

90
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.620
I show how to configure that in the deployment section.

91
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.480
This really is just the YNAB screen, which is shown whilst we are waiting for the firebase off package

92
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.670
to figure out if the user is authenticated or not.

93
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.810
So that's something different.

94
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.400
Yeah.

95
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.290
And you can find you this however you want.

96
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.690
But I would say with that, we get all those improvements in place that really make this a great app

97
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.460
with a lot of nice features.
