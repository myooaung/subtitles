00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.980
We can certainly improve the styling of this app and

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.960
for this, let's go into the main.dart file and work on the general theme there.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.470
Now I don't want to set up an overlay complex theme to be honest,

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.380
we did a lot of theming in earlier modules,

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.060
I just want to use a different primary swatch and also add user accent color.

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.950
My primary color will be purple here and my accent color will be deep orange but again, you can of course

7
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.290
use any styling you want.

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:38.810
What I also want to do and what we did before too of course is add a custom font. So for that, as before,

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.390
let's add a new folder, I'll name it assets and in there, I want to have a fonts folder and attached, you find a

10
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.210
zip file with fonts you can drag and drop into there. Three fonts or two fonts but three different styles,

11
00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.290
Lato and Anton and as before, we have to register those in the pubspec.yaml file to use them.

12
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.870
So in the pubspec.yaml file, go to the part where you see some dummy font set up, comment that

13
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.280
in and then define these fonts. We have Lato for example and we find it in the assets folder and there in

14
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:24.960
the fonts folder and there, we have Lato-Regular and Lato-Bold, so let's add both here fonts, Lato-Bold.

15
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.900
These are the paths and the file names and this is not style italic

16
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.450
but instead, it has a weight of 700 and let's add another font family now below that

17
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.020
and that's the Anton font where we only have one version, the name of the file there is Anton-Regular,

18
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.980
so let's use that here,

19
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.570
Anton-Regular and we don't need to define a weight there.

20
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.510
So these are the fonts I want to add and I want to use Lato as the main font in the application,

21
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.330
so in the main.dart file when we define the theme, we can set up the font family and set it to Lato to

22
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.630
use this font.

23
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.070
And with that, since we added fonts, let's actually quit this application and do a full rebuild and restart

24
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.740
so that these fonts are included now and once this finished,

25
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.530
we should have different colors and we also should have a different font in there and indeed,

26
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.750
we do have that.

27
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.190
Now I want to change the icon colors here as well, so on the product icon here on both

28
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.970
IconButtons

29
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:42.710
we can set the color and here I want to use theme of and then of context of course and use my accent color

30
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.010
here which is this deep orange and I'll add this to the other icon button here as well, like that.

31
00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:00.050
So now with that, we have orange buttons here and maybe we can now use a slightly darker black here, less

32
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:09.260
transparent black, black38 maybe, less transparent, so black87 maybe,

33
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.370
yes I think that looks better.

34
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.660
So now we have these icons here which we can press and which allows us to add items to the cart or to mark

35
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.910
this as a favorite, which of course doesn't work right now

36
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.180
and with that, our grid tiles are taking shape.

37
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.350
I now also want to have rounded corners and the GridTile itself has no argument that would allow us

38
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.980
to set rounded corners.

39
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.280
However, we already covered earlier in the course what we can do in such cases, do you remember? We can

40
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.660
wrap the widget where we want to add rounded corners with a new widget and the new widget is 

41
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.940
ClipRRect which simply forces the child widget it wraps into a certain shape and therefore on ClipRRect,

42
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.320
we can now define the border radius because there is a widget, ClipRRect is a widget that helps us

43
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.620
with clipping a rectangle to add rounded corners because the R here stands for, it stands for

44
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.480
clip rounded rectangles and therefore, this is the shape it forms or it forces on every child widget.

45
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.030
And therefore here we can set up the border radius and

46
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.970
we do this by setting this to BorderRadius.circular,

47
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.410
maybe a value of 10 then.

48
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.010
Now we have some rounded corners here which doesn't look too bad in my opinion.

49
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:36.690
Of course, if you wanted to, you could also wrap the image here in our GridTile here into a container with

50
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.740
a border or a background color or a drop shadow if you wanted to change these items even more regarding

51
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.160
their styling.

52
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.170
I'm happy with that

53
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.980
look here however,

54
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.050
so I'll leave it as it is,

55
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.340
don't want to spend too much time on this and instead, let's now get closer to that state management

56
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.380
thing because the next steps will be to make this favoriting feature work

57
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.920
and of course, I also want to add a detail page and then a cart where we can add items to

58
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.020
and that will require us to rethink the state management.

59
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.760
So let's work towards these features.
