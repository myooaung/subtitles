00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:10.220
So what is Flutter? Flutter is a tool that allows to build native cross-platform and that means for iOS

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.830
and Android apps with the one programming language and codebase.

3
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.770
So let's have a closer look at this nice sentence here.

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.470
Important is that we build native cross-platform apps, 

5
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.330
so we build both an iOS app and an Android app.

6
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.450
We're not building a web app that runs in the browser,

7
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.560
we're not building an app that gets wrapped by native apps,

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.480
we build real apps, two different kinds of apps in the end for iOS and Android, which you then distribute

9
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.850
through the different app stores,

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.980
so through the Apple App Store and the Google Play store,

11
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.490
that's what you get as a result.

12
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.610
Now you get there by using one programming language, so that you don't have to learn two different programming

13
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.050
languages, one for iOS, one for Android,

14
00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.030
instead you have one programming language, Dart but I'll come back to that and also one codebase.

15
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.120
So you work in one project, you write your code once and you still get two different apps as a result

16
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.490
and that's the cool thing about Flutter,

17
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.680
you only learn one programming language,

18
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.810
you only write your code once and you get two apps. Without Flutter,

19
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.580
you would normally build an iOS app by writing some Swift or Objective C code and using the iOS development

20
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.460
environment and for Android, you would be using Java with the Android framework or you would be using

21
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.010
Koplin and also the Android development environment and you would have to learn all these different

22
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.100
languages and tools and you would have to write two totally different apps or work in two totally different

23
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.510
projects and with Flutter,

24
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.610
that's not the case,

25
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.590
one programming language and one codebase. If we have a closer look at Flutter though, it's actually

26
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.990
a combination of things,

27
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.770
the term Flutter refers to two major things.

28
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.290
One is an SDK, a Software Development Kit,

29
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.370
you could say a collection of tools that allows you to write one codebase or use one codebase with

30
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.850
one programming language because it includes tools to then compile this code, which normally would not

31
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.600
run on iOS and Android into native machine code that does run on these platforms because if there would

32
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.740
be one programming language that would work on both platforms, we wouldn't need Flutter

33
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.960
but there isn't.

34
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.270
Now therefore, the one programming language Flutter uses doesn't work on iOS and Android,

35
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.270
so it needs to be compiled to native machine code for iOS and native machine code for Android

36
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.190
so that we have code that has run on these platforms and that compilation task, along with a couple of

37
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.870
other things,

38
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.280
that's all part of Flutter but of course, it's not just a collection of tools,

39
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.530
it also gives you everything you need to create beautiful applications.

40
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.900
It gives you a framework, a widget library for that one programming language which is called Dart which

41
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.260
you can use to build beautiful Flutter apps

42
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.710
and that's what we will spend the majority of time with of course.

43
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.270
It gives you a vast collection of reusable UI building blocks, these so-called widgets,

44
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.400
so these are things like buttons, tabs, text inputs, drop downs, you get all of that out of the box. You

45
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.900
can style them and customize them and then you build user interfaces with these tools.

46
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.590
In addition, you get a couple of utility functions and generally, some packages that help you build what

47
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.140
your users see and what your users interact with and then that code which you built with the help of

48
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.820
that framework, that is then compiled native machine code with the help of the SDK.

49
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.690
So that is what Flutter is.

50
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.800
Now as I mentioned, Flutter uses a programming language called Dart. Dart is a programming language which

51
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.760
is focused on building front-end user interfaces, front-end apps.

52
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.050
It's not limited to building mobile apps,

53
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.250
that's just what Flutter uses it for

54
00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.940
but Dart is independent of Flutter and you can also build web apps with Dart but we'll not focus just

55
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.820
on Dart here, we'll focus on Flutter and how it use Dart and Flutter uses Dart mostly for

56
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.450
building mobile apps. So it's a programming language built to make it really simple to build front-end

57
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.820
user interfaces.

58
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.470
It's a programming language which was developed by Google or is developed by Google, just like Flutter,

59
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.320
so these are actually two independent teams in Google but of course they're working together to improve

60
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.030
each other

61
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.520
and therefore, we have a hand in hand solution here

62
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.980
and in case you already have some programming experience, it's an object oriented and strongly typed

63
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.200
language and its syntax is a bit like a mixture of Javascript, Java, C#

64
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.640
but you don't need to know any of these languages and actually, you don't need to know anything about

65
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.310
programming to follow along. In this course,

66
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.720
I will teach you Dart from scratch along with Flutter, so we'll build Flutter apps and you'll learn Dart

67
00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.980
and the features you're using there along the way because I think that's the most fun way of learning

68
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.050
that programming language and already see nice results,

69
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.850
the apps we're building. So Flutter and Dart are not really alternatives, instead they're working together.

70
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.240
Flutter builds up on Dart,

71
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.900
it's a framework for Dart and Dart actually is the programming language which we're using, Flutter then just is

72
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.610
a collection of tools, a set of features, utility functions and these widgets which are implemented

73
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.680
using Dart, so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel there but you can write your own Dart code and

74
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.730
use these existing widgets in your code so that you don't have to again reinvent how a button should

75
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.370
look like and work but use the pre-built button instead and then just customize it to your requirements,

76
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.220
that's how this works.

77
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.500
And in addition as mentioned, Flutter also gives you that SDK,

78
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.440
so all these tools for compiling your code in the end.
