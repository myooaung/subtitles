00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.370
We have the basic off form, but I don't want to use the default blue color.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.670
I also don't want to use the default button theme.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.940
Instead, I want to set my own themes.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.750
And for this in the main DARD file here in the theme data, which is configured, we can change the

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.960
colors and also some other styles we want to set as a default.

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.930
For example, the primary swatch here.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.350
I don't want to use colors blue here, but colors pink.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.600
Yeah, I like that pink color here.

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.540
In addition, I want to set a background color, a default background color of that same pink.

10
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.840
I also want to set an accent color and that will be this Deep Purple, which I think mixes nicely with

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.440
that pink.

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.620
I also want to let her know that this purple color is a very dark color and that any contrasting color

13
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.460
on this purple background should therefore be a bright color.

14
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.450
And we can do this by setting the exact color brightness to brightness.

15
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.370
Got dark.

16
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.030
We don't need to do this on the primary swatch there.

17
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.050
Flutter should drive does automatically, but we should do this here.

18
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.190
To avoid that, we end up with black text on purple, for example.

19
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.090
And I also want to set up a specific button theme, which every button will get by default, and to

20
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.270
do this, I basically want to inherit from the default button theme and then just overwrite some parts

21
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.810
that we can use the buttons theme constructor here and use the Oth constructor.

22
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.410
So not the default constructor, but this named constructor and pass in the regular context and then

23
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.820
call copy with.

24
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.320
And this allows you to then override some of the keys and use the other default values.

25
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.050
For example, I will set the button color to colors pink so that every button by default has that pink

26
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.920
main color.

27
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.340
All set to text them to button text that primary.

28
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.350
This should make sure that we have the right contrast color and also change the default shape of buttons

29
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.790
for this, because that's the shape configuration and then set this to rounded rectangle border.

30
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.460
Use this constructor here and queue rounded rectangle border, we can pass a border radius argument

31
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.670
and there we can set the default border radius every button should have with the border radius constructor,

32
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.370
to be precise, with the circular named constructor.

33
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.470
This provides and then set this to 20 maybe.

34
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.870
And if we do that Insaaf that you see now, I have a rounded button here by default and I have this

35
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.360
pink background color, which looks quite nice.

36
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.380
Now, this button still has a blue text, and we can change this by going to the off form and then on

37
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.720
this flat button, I'll change the text color to theme of context, primary color.

38
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.050
And this doesn't look too bad now, it would be nice to also have a working off for him which collects

39
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.350
the user inputs, which validates the user inputs, and where we also can switch between log in and

40
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.160
sign up mode.

41
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.760
Now, you can try this on your own, because thus far that's nothing we haven't learned.

42
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.250
Of course, you shouldn't yet also use the FIREBASE SDK to send this to a server, but collecting and

43
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.460
validating the input data is something you definitely are able to do.

44
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.980
We'll do together in the next lecture.
