WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.870
So we want to load that jet screen if we are authenticated and therefore in Maine darte, we need to

2
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.080
swap this off screen for to chat screen.

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.840
If we do find out that we have a BELITZ Tolkan now in the AFT section, we did something similar.

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.530
But there you saw that there are a couple of steps you need to to do or you need to take care about

5
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.650
when you're managing the token on your own.

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.320
The cool thing is with Firebase and Firebase off, that entire Tolkan management is done for you and

7
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.280
therefore swapping pages based on the off status is extremely easy.

8
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.500
We can replace our home, which is here with a stream builder, I showed you the stream builder early

9
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.050
already.

10
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.370
Now this takes a stream and then a builder argument.

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.140
Now for the stream.

12
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.430
All here, not take like cloud firestorm, but instead my fire pays off package or a feature from that

13
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.970
package.

14
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.290
So I'll import package fire based off Firebase of Dodge Dart.

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.000
And then with that important here, we can use firebase orthodontia instance, dot on Off-stage changed,

16
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.320
and this gives us a stream and this stream will emit a new value whenever the all state changes and

17
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.950
the off-stage changes, when we sign up, when we log in, when we log out, but also when the app is

18
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.910
loading, it will check if there is a cached token and that caching and storage will be managed entirely

19
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.420
by Firebase here by the Firebase Flutter package.

20
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.700
And if it finds such a token, it will validate the token and if token is valid, it will even use that

21
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.940
token even after a new app startup.

22
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.130
So did the entire Tolkan stretch and manage it across app restarts stuff is fully managed by Firebase

23
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.610
here, which is extremely convenient.

24
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.660
So we just need to listen to that stream.

25
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.240
And then the builder here will fire whenever our off status changes here, we get the context and we

26
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.400
get that user snapshot.

27
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:13.070
And in this function, we then can return different widgets based on the user snapshot.

28
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.210
We can check if the user snapshot has data, which means that we did find a token, essentially.

29
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.400
And in that case, we can return the chat screen to chat.

30
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.230
Screen here.

31
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.190
House data is a field that is available on the snapshot to, well, indicate whether we found some valid

32
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.560
data, if we didn't find data, will return the off screen because then we need to authenticate it.

33
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.610
If we're now saved, as you will see that the chat screen is here, because I did sign up earlier,

34
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.640
Firebase, as I explained multiple times, did take and stored at Tolkan and managed it behind the scenes

35
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.540
and the effort just by adding this code, Firebase checked if it had a token.

36
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.600
It does, and therefore it logs us in and it renders the chat screen just like that all managed behind

37
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.020
the scenes.

38
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.420
So that's my firebase authentication is really amazing here now to see it fully in action, logout functionality

39
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.660
might also be nice and therefore I'll go to the chat screen and here on the scaffold.

40
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.000
I'll add a Apapa.

41
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.500
The default abar.

42
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.950
And this app bar will get a title.

43
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.300
Which can be a text widget where I say.

44
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.640
Flutter, chat, anything like that, and more importantly than that, it will get some actions.

45
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.360
Actions is an array of widgets, and there I want to add a dropdown button, which is a default widget

46
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.410
that comes with flutter.

47
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.410
The dropdown button is able to render Aykan, which is displayed in the action bar, and they're all

48
00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:02.000
use the icon widget and then the more virt icon, which basically gives us three vertical dots.

49
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.770
I'll also set the.

50
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.600
Color.

51
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.890
Here of the Eichen to theme of context, primary color.

52
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.800
Sorry, not primary, but primary, I can theme color.

53
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.570
Like this.

54
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.400
Now, this will render a nice drop down button, which we see here, but this button doesn't do anything

55
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.870
right now.

56
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.340
So to make sure that it does.

57
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.320
On the drop down button, but outside of the icon, we set some items, which are the items that are

58
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.770
shown when we click the drop down button, and that, again, is a list of widgets.

59
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.810
And here we typically render a drop down menu items.

60
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.060
And that is a single item in that dropdown and here I want to have one item.

61
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.660
It has a child where I will use a container and that container has a child where I will use a rope because

62
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.950
I want to render two widgets next to each other here as a child in that dropdown.

63
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:18.630
The two widgets next to each other should be Aykan, so a regular Aykan widget where I use the exit

64
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.430
to app icon and then a text widget where I say.

65
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.940
Logout and for some extra spacing, I'll add a third widget here, a size box where I set the width

66
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.630
to eight.

67
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.960
Now, we also need to give this drop down menu item value, which will act as an identifier, and I'll

68
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.070
just use logout here.

69
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.330
The value is up to you.

70
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:55.620
With that back on the entire drop down button here, you can add on changed argument and that should

71
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.590
be a function which gets the item identifier.

72
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.790
So the value you specified here, if you had multiple items, you could find out which item was pressed

73
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.040
by looking at the identifier here.

74
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.510
Of course, we have only one item.

75
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.750
Still, for completeness sake, I'll check if item identifier is equal to logout, to which, of course,

76
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.670
should be here, since that's our only item.

77
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.450
And if that's the case, I want to log out for this.

78
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.690
I'll again use the firebase off package.

79
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:34.830
So package firebase off, firebase off dot dart and here we can then call Firebase off dot instant's

80
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.240
dot sign out and this will lock the user out.

81
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:47.140
With all of that now, we can open this and if I click logout, I'm back here because this science yuzu

82
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:54.430
out, it will automatically destroy the token and it will emit a new event here on the off state changed

83
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.940
stream.

84
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.870
And there we will find out that we no longer have a token.

85
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.460
So we won't make it into this if statement and instead does off screen is returned again.

86
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.790
And therefore now if I log in again here.

87
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.350
You, of course, see that we go back to the chat screen, so that works, that logon and log out part

88
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.800
works.

89
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.470
So that was a lot of progress.

90
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:26.150
Let me now talk briefly about some firebase database rules, which are important when we talk about

91
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:31.190
security on Firebase before we then start working on the actual chat here.
