00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.470
The reason for this strange positioning here is not that the navigation bar height wouldn't be taken

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.160
into account,

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.910
it is,

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.980
you can always print the appBar preferred size height here if you want to. You can always add print app

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.410
bar, preferred size height and you'll see that this has a value on iOS as well.

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.620
The problem rather is that on this simulator, we have this top notch and actually also at the bottom, we

7
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.300
have a little bit of reserved space for that app drawer task manager

8
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.860
icon here on iOS.

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.840
We didn't have that on Android and the emulator there and that simply means that some of the available

10
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.260
space on the screen is reserved and can't be used for positioning the widgets

11
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.630
or at least it shouldn't be used for positioning the widgets. The navigation bar automatically respects

12
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.840
this and is not sitting here on the top but pushed down a little bit and we should respect this as well

13
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.450
and Flutter makes this really simple for our body which in the end is this part here, in the page body

14
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:11.940
variable, we can use a special widget which is built into Flutter, the SafeArea widget. We simply wrap

15
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.800
our body, in this case the SingeChildScrollView, with that widget and therefore we also have to add

16
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.910
a closing parentheses down there

17
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.090
and this simply means that or make sure that everything is positioned within the boundaries or moved

18
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.360
down a bit, moved up a bit so that we respect these reserved areas on the screen

19
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.040
you could say and that ensures that now, everything is positioned correctly again.

20
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.900
Now when I rotate the screen, we also see we have a problem here with the show chart

21
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.470
text.
