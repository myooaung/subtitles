00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.580
In this lecture,

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.740
we'll install Flutter on a Windows machine

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.420
and we'll set up Windows and install all the tools we need

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.440
to develop Flutter apps on Windows.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.290
If you are not following along on Windows,

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.640
you can therefore of course,

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.910
skip this lecture and the next lecture as well,

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.270
because in the next lecture,

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.090
we'll set up the environment for writing code

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.320
with for Flutter on Windows.

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.930
Now the best way to start installing Flutter and everything

12
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.630
we need is to go to Flutter.dev,

13
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.890
which is the official website of the Flutter project.

14
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880
And there you can go to docs and then click on,

15
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.560
get started and find instructions

16
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.750
for different operating systems.

17
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.823
And here we are, of course, interested in Windows.

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.440
Now the official docs are a great place to also dive in

19
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.869
and get written instructions

20
00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.970
in case you should get stuck at some point,

21
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.270
we will go through all the important steps to gather here,

22
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.520
but definitely also dive into this stocks here

23
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.710
if you are facing any problems

24
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.300
or if you may be just also

25
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.110
wanna get some written instructions,

26
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.663
in addition to this video,

27
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.030
Now it all starts with the system requirements here.

28
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.150
So you need to meet these requirements

29
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.120
if you wanna use Flutter, there's no way around that.

30
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.070
Especially the Git requirement might not be met yet,

31
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.530
but Git is an extra tool which you normally use

32
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.120
for controlling source code

33
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.690
and saving source code snapshots,

34
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.300
which is getting used by Flutter under the hood,

35
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.100
and which we therefore need to install

36
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.650
before we can install and use Flutter.

37
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.380
You can just follow this link here to download

38
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.380
an installer for Windows, so for Git for Windows.

39
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.500
And I'll do that here, download this installer.

40
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.450
And then once this download finished,

41
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.760
we can simply walk through that installer

42
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.023
and we'll do that together in just a second.

43
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.229
Here we go.

44
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.700
And basically just keep the defaults here.

45
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.450
So I'll keep all these defaults,

46
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.590
which will make working with Flutter easier

47
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.280
since everything will just work

48
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.350
if you use the defaults and you wanna keep

49
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.830
all the defaults here on this page as well.

50
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.460
Continue, you can keep this default here as well

51
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.010
if you want to.

52
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.150
Click next, click next here as well.

53
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.540
And now very important on this screen here,

54
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.930
where it's about adjusting your path environment

55
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.050
we find on the Flutter page,

56
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.010
that we should ensure that we can use Git

57
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.200
from the Windows Command Prompt

58
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.570
and therefore this middle option should be checked here.

59
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.427
It's the default typically, it's recommended here

60
00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:58.070
and we should make sure that we use this option here.

61
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.830
And then click next.

62
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.460
We can leave that as well,

63
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.830
leave all these defaults here and just click through all

64
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
these options here and then click install at the end.

65
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.380
And this will now install this git tool

66
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.500
which we could use for managing our source code

67
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.420
and for creating snapshots,

68
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.660
you can explore a standalone courses and talks on that,

69
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.440
but that's not a must do,

70
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.040
but Flutter we'll use this tool under the hood

71
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.090
and therefore we need to know install it.

72
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.600
So let's wait for this installation to finish here.

73
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.020
Once this did finish,

74
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.930
I'm not going to read the release notes, but click finish.

75
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.320
And now we can move on to installing Flutter.

76
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320
For this we can download it here.

77
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.190
And of course the exact version you are seeing here

78
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.220
when you are following along

79
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.540
will very likely be a different one than

80
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.700
I see here,

81
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.040
but you will still learn Flutter in the correct way

82
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.430
through out this course no worries.

83
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.470
So here I'll just download Flutter

84
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.170
and that's a around big download.

85
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.420
So it can take a while until it's finished.

86
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.920
And once this is finished, we will extract that Zip file,

87
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.500
which is downloaded here

88
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.090
and we can see that in step two here,

89
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.690
we can place that Flutter folder,

90
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.399
which we'll get by extracting that Zip file

91
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:24.860
in any desired installation location on our system.

92
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.230
And typically you wanna use some global location there are

93
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.220
somewhere on your root drive.

94
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.930
However, not in C program files, as you see here,

95
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.260
and also not in any other folder

96
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.860
that might have restricted access.

97
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.140
For example, not the system 32 folder,

98
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.580
but instead some root folder where your Windows user

99
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.250
has full unrestricted read and write access.

100
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.130
So for example,

101
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.820
the documents folder and your user folder, as you see here,

102
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.053
but you can use any root folder.

103
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.850
So the download finished for me here and hence all extract

104
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.993
that file here, that Zip file.

105
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.810
And in there you find this Flutter folder,

106
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.840
I'll now move that Flutter folders to some our destination

107
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.840
on my system to be precise here, I'm in my a user folder.

108
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.250
And in there I'm going to create a new folder.

109
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.630
I do apologize for this being German here,

110
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.760
but I'll just create a new folder,

111
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.573
which I'll name development.

112
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.910
And in that development folder,

113
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.590
I'll create a new sub folder,

114
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.270
which I'll name SDKs, and then in this SDKs folder,

115
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.430
which is my root user folder

116
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.910
and then in that development folder there,

117
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.990
I'll direct that Flutter folder into.

118
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.170
So this extracted Flutter folder goes into that SDKs folder

119
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.910
in my development folder, in my user folder.

120
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.400
And you should store your Flutter STK,

121
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.590
this extracted Flutter folder

122
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.730
in some global location like this,

123
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.560
so that you can easily work with it from anywhere

124
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.320
on your system later on,

125
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.483
because that's what we'll need to do there.

126
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.300
Now, since this is big,

127
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.740
this can take a couple of seconds if you do it like this,

128
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.810
and I'll we'll therefore be back ones this

129
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.443
has been copied over.

130
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.597
Now moving that folder finished for me here.

131
00:06:26.597 --> 00:06:31.190
And that means that now we did download and install Flutter,

132
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.480
but Flutter is not a tool that we then opened

133
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.230
by double clicking on it

134
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.840
instead it is a tool which we typically invoke

135
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.390
through the command prompt,

136
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.920
which is installed on every Windows system

137
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.753
and therefore what

138
00:06:44.753 --> 00:06:48.430
we need to do next is we need to update our path,

139
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.370
which means that we make this Flutter command,

140
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.530
this Flutter tool that we installed globally available

141
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.550
inside of the command prompt, no matter where on our system,

142
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.080
we then execute this.

143
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.500
And this will be super important.

144
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.740
Now for that what we have to do is

145
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.547
we have to add it to our environment variables.

146
00:07:10.547 --> 00:07:14.630
For this, you can type env here into this quick-start area.

147
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.900
And for me again, it's German,

148
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.330
but this is added our environment variables.

149
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.930
And here you wanna click on user variables

150
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.520
or environment variables here.

151
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.910
And then these are some global variables,

152
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.410
which in the end all is the control,

153
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.440
which commands can be invoked

154
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.110
from inside your command prompt.

155
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.750
And there you should have a path variable.

156
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.710
If you don't have it, you can create it

157
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.140
but very often you will have one already.

158
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.060
And then you should add it to this path variable

159
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.683
by clicking on edit.

160
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.230
And here you can now add new entries

161
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.890
to this environment variable.

162
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.080
And here what you wanna do is you want

163
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.470
to add an entry that points at this Flutter folder,

164
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.690
which we moved into a global destination on our system.

165
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.370
So for this here and back in the STKs folder,

166
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.050
I'll go into that Flutter folder

167
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.310
and they're into the bin folder.

168
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.950
And then I click in here to grab this path to the bin folder

169
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.600
on my system, this entire path

170
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.290
that's what I need here.

171
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.310
And in there, we have that Flutter and that dart command,

172
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.920
and these are the commands which we wanna invoke

173
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.390
from the Command-Line later

174
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.270
and therefore we need to add the path

175
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.039
to this tools to our path environment variable.

176
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.260
So here, where I'm editing this path environment variable,

177
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.370
I'll add a new entry to it and just paste

178
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.299
in this path I selected

179
00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.260
so that it's part of this path environment variable

180
00:08:44.328 --> 00:08:45.805
and then we can click OK

181
00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:48.127
And now this was added here

182
00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:52.690
and we can now click OK again, close all these settings,

183
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.650
and now you should be able to invoke the Flutter command

184
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.290
from inside your command prompt.

185
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.980
And that's what we'll try it right away.

186
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.970
I'll open my default command prompt.

187
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.210
You can find it by simply typing command

188
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.920
into your quick start menu.

189
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.726
Use this command prompt here

190
00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:12.750
and then here in this command prompt,

191
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.933
you can type Flutter like that.

192
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.070
And this should then work.

193
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.280
It should show you a list of available commands

194
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.390
in the end here which it does for me,

195
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.370
it should not show any error.

196
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.070
And that proves that we did successfully add it

197
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.570
as an environment variable.

198
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.990
Now in here, what you can do is

199
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.720
you can run Flutter doctor,

200
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.490
which is a little analysis command,

201
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.740
which will analyze your system and see if it's ready

202
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.390
to build Flutter apps.

203
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.620
And this will therefore for first of all,

204
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.330
download some extra software and then run this check.

205
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.190
And right now it will probably fail because for example,

206
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.570
we have not set up everything for Android development yet,

207
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.210
and that's important because that will be the next step.

208
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.630
We can use Flutter as a tool

209
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.029
to build cross-platform applications,

210
00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:11.850
but we actually need to install extra tools,

211
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.520
which will be used by Flutter under the hood

212
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.710
to then really build for iOS or Android.

213
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.290
And that's always important on Windows you unfortunately,

214
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.200
can't build for iOS.

215
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.270
That's a restriction by Apple,

216
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.433
not by Flutter.

217
00:10:28.469 --> 00:10:30.108
You can't build iOS apps on Windows

218
00:10:30.108 --> 00:10:32.940
you can only build Android apps there.

219
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.733
You need a Mac to build iOS apps there it is what it is,

220
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.830
but we can build Android apps

221
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.020
by going for the Android setup,

222
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.713
which we also find here in the official docs.

223
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.180
And what we need to do here in the Android set up

224
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.540
is we need to install Android Studio,

225
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.090
which is the official development environment

226
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.030
by Google for building Android applications.

227
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.863
So for that

228
00:10:58.863 --> 00:11:00.230
we can follow this link

229
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.190
and open the Android studio website here,

230
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.133
then simply download Android Studio.

231
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.650
Accept the terms here, I guess,

232
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.140
and then start this download,

233
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.490
which is also big and therefore can

234
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.820
take a couple of seconds or minutes.

235
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.210
Now I'll be back once this download finished

236
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.120
so that we can then walk through this installer,

237
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.670
which we'll get there together.

238
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.930
So here we go, download finished.

239
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.430
I'll now start this installer that we downloaded here

240
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.090
to install Android studio.

241
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.300
And here we can now walk through that installation wizard,

242
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.400
which for some reason is a bit blurry for me here,

243
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.233
but anyways,

244
00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.380
we can walk through it and basically keep

245
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.280
all these default settings,

246
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.520
especially also make sure you're installing

247
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.580
the Android virtual device here.

248
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.277
We'll need dev for running Emulators later,

249
00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:56.720
which are virtual Android phones on our computer

250
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.530
to test and review our Flutter apps.

251
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.960
So we definitely want that click next,

252
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.880
keep that default location

253
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.600
if there is any way of doing that.

254
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.896
So unless you really have to install it somewhere else,

255
00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.020
don't install it somewhere else.

256
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.810
Instead, keep that default

257
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.900
it will make working with Android so much easier

258
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.080
because everything will just work

259
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.500
and Flutter we'll find Android studio

260
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.770
without issues and so on.

261
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.770
So keep that default possible, click next and install.

262
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.330
And this will now install Android Studio onto our system.

263
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:38.683
So let's wait for this installation process to finish here.

264
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.500
And once this is finished, we can also start it immediately.

265
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.780
So keep that checkbox checked here and start Android studio

266
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.983
like this.

267
00:12:49.983 --> 00:12:51.220
And by default,

268
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.020
when you started for the first time,

269
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:58.020
you should get this wizard here, this setup wizard.

270
00:12:58.485 --> 00:13:01.610
And we'll definitely go through that wizard here

271
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.620
because we need certain settings

272
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.450
and tools to be set up

273
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.600
and we can set them up through that wizard.

274
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.260
So here I'll choose custom

275
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.160
so that I can customize everything.

276
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.380
And the first thing I'll do is I'll keep that default path

277
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.730
here for this Java Development Kit,

278
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.380
which is required under the hood.

279
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.390
And as always try to keep that default path,

280
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.913
if double click next,

281
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.770
then you can chose the theme of the editor.

282
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.520
It's not too important because I won't use Android studio

283
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.890
for writing code here anyways,

284
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.570
we just use it under the hood or a Flutter.

285
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.810
We'll use it under the hood for building our Android apps,

286
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.660
but still I'll choose that dark mode here, click next.

287
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.120
And then here very important,

288
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.490
make sure you do install an Android version year.

289
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.430
In my case,

290
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.880
I'll install API 30 that you do install the Android SDK

291
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.540
and that you do install the Android virtual device here.

292
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.690
And if you have the option also install into HAXM.

293
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.500
Now you might not be able to select this

294
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.860
and that's fine as well.

295
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.740
You don't need it, but if you can install it

296
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.590
definitely do because this

297
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.670
will speed up this virtual Emulator later

298
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.623
and simply make it run a bit smoother.

299
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.953
So basically here,

300
00:14:24.953 --> 00:14:27.963
you wanna check all these options and click next.

301
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.600
Then here you can leave these defaults for allocating memory

302
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.790
to the Emulator.

303
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.170
So to this virtual Android device,

304
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.290
which we will soon run on our system,

305
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.310
click next and click finish,

306
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.630
and the this will now download and install more tools

307
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.620
under the hood.

308
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.510
So therefore again,

309
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.110
this can take a couple of minutes to finish

310
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.143
and I'll be back once it did finish.

311
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.240
No set up this finished for me here.

312
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.430
So I'll finish this here and now what we can do

313
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:04.620
on this opening or this welcome screen here is first of all,

314
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.720
we can go to the STK Manager

315
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.070
by clicking on configure STK Manager.

316
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.980
And there you can install any missing pieces

317
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.180
that you might still need though, with that default setup,

318
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.770
we chosen the wizard we should be fine.

319
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.530
The only thing I do recommend here

320
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.980
is that you go to SDK tools

321
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.260
and you choose the Android SDK Command-Line Tools here.

322
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.960
You should install those as well since

323
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.960
that can actually a wide some unnecessary errors later,

324
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.800
but that should be all you need to install right now.

325
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.583
So I'll choose that here and click, OK, again,

326
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.910
click here and accept the license and click next.

327
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.790
And this will now again,

328
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.780
download and install this extra utility software,

329
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.613
which we need.

330
00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:55.453
So let's wait for this to finish.

331
00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.030
And once this did finish, we can click finish.

332
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.440
And then again, on this welcome screen,

333
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.277
click on configure AVD Manager, by the way,

334
00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:08.350
you should get this welcome screen

335
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.450
whenever you start Android studio.

336
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.230
So that's how you can get back there

337
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.170
if you don't see it.

338
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:17.130
And then there click on configure AVD Manager,

339
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.930
that is where you can manage the virtual devices.

340
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.800
So the virtual Android Emulators,

341
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.900
you can run on your system.

342
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.650
And these are basically virtual Android phones or tablets,

343
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.900
which you can run on your computer

344
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.830
to test Android apps on them,

345
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.216
so that you don't need a real Android phone for testing

346
00:16:39.216 --> 00:16:40.507
and also so that

347
00:16:40.507 --> 00:16:44.040
you can easily configure different virtual phones

348
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.990
on which you can test your Android apps.

349
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.030
So that's a very useful tool

350
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.910
which we'll use during development to preview

351
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.993
our Flutter app on Android.

352
00:16:54.032 --> 00:16:57.270
Now you might have a default phone already, if not,

353
00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.945
you can click on create virtual device

354
00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:03.010
and choose any device blueprint you want.

355
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.700
Like the pixel free here.

356
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.560
That's what I'll use click on next.

357
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.490
And then choose an Android version

358
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.869
you wanna install there

359
00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:16.329
and I'll use the latest stable version at the moment

360
00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.640
and click download here to install

361
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.700
that well operating system for this Emulator,

362
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.130
which again can take a short while

363
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.510
since it's big.

364
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.483
So let's wait for this to finish.

365
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.123
Here we go.

366
00:17:32.123 --> 00:17:34.770
Now that's finished and now

367
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.850
I can choose this Android version,

368
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.750
click next and then finish setting up this blueprint.

369
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.130
And now I can start this phone by clicking

370
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.720
on this play button here to launch

371
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.460
this virtual Android device and will need

372
00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.490
such a virtual Android device to simply preview

373
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:57.074
and test the Flutter app that we're building on Android.

374
00:17:57.074 --> 00:18:01.060
Now this can take a while until this started up,

375
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.893
but for the moment,

376
00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:03.780
we can already go back to the official docs

377
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.590
and continue here.

378
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.423
By the way,

379
00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:09.690
we can also connect a real Android device

380
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.730
to our system

381
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.700
and run our Flutter app on that.

382
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.860
But we'll not do that right now instead

383
00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.670
we will do that later in the course.

384
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.260
So we'll ignore this set up your Android device part

385
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.610
for now and we did already set up our Emulator here.

386
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.170
So that should already all be fine

387
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.310
though you can also go through these written steps again,

388
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.283
if you want to.

389
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.650
Now the Emulator is up and running for me here,

390
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.530
and now it's time to go back to the command prompt

391
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:44.180
and in there run Flutter doctor again,

392
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.773
now that we did set up Android a bit more and so on,

393
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.180
and this now looks better though

394
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.020
we still got a warning regarding the Android toolchain

395
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.030
and that warning tells us that we need

396
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.963
to accept some extra Android licenses.

397
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.050
It also shows us the command we have to run for that

398
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.910
and that's the convenient thing about Flutter doctor

399
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.240
it very often shows you fix this

400
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.673
you can use if certain issues are detected,

401
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.270
we can see that we, for example,

402
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.200
get a connected device now though.

403
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.140
So now here I will simply

404
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.140
run Flutter doctor --Android - licenses

405
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.500
as recommended here and hit enter.

406
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.350
And then this will now automatically accept

407
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.410
all those Android licenses to be precise it,

408
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.377
asks me whether I wanna accept

409
00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.945
and I'll type y here for yes,

410
00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:42.980
all the time,

411
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.730
every time I'm prompted to accept all those licenses.

412
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.193
And now with that finished.

413
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:52.622
If you did get an error here

414
00:19:52.622 --> 00:19:54.655
make sure you installed

415
00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:56.430
those Android Command-Line Tools I showed you

416
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.610
a couple of minutes ago through the SDK Manager

417
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.243
inside of Android Studio.

418
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.980
And now by doing that, if we now run Flutter doctor again,

419
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.950
we now finally should have a working Android setup.

420
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.873
That looks good.

421
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.460
So we now went through this step here

422
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.130
and we won't continue with Windows setups

423
00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.010
since we will focus on building mobile apps

424
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.390
with Flutter in this course

425
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.920
and therefore now we installed Flutter and Android studio,

426
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.940
we've got all these tools set up.

427
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.360
In the next lecture we'll now create

428
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.290
a new Flutter project

429
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.365
and set up our development environment

430
00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:38.963
and run this Flutter app on our Emulator.
