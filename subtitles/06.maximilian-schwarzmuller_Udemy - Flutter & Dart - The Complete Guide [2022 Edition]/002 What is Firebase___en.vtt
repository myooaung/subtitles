00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.800
Now, let's briefly plan what we're going to build and where we're going to add which feature in our

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.920
application, we're essentially have two main screens.

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.460
We'll have this authentication part where you enter your email, username and password and where you

4
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.530
can also pick and upload an image.

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.310
And once a user is authenticated, we'll also have this chat screen where you can send messages and

6
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.360
also see messages by other users, always combined with their image and also user name will also implement

7
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.770
push notifications there at the end to make sure that if our app is closed, we actually get a notification

8
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.530
about a new message and we can then tap this message to, well, bring this app back up.

9
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.360
Now, in this module, we're going to use Firebase and Firebase is a fully managed backend service.

10
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.360
It's by Google, just like flutter, but it's totally independent from flutter.

11
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.440
You don't have to use Firebase with flutter.

12
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.450
It works without flutter as well.

13
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.190
Now, we actually already did use Firebase in this course.

14
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.370
We used it as a dummy backend API in the sections on firebases.

15
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.750
Not just that, though.

16
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.590
I used it there because that allowed me to show you how you can connect Flattr to any back end without

17
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.250
having to write any back and code here, because this is a flutter, of course.

18
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.560
So therefore I wanted to focus on flutter, but that's the only reason why I use Firebase here.

19
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.130
We didn't really utilize any amazing firebase features in those sections.

20
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.030
Well, now we're going to do that.

21
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.600
And I will show you that if you use Firebase, not just because it's a nice dummy backend, but because

22
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.990
you want to use it and you want to build a complete app where Firebase runs your backend, that firebase

23
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.720
ships with a lot of cool features that make building a powerful app.

24
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.800
Breece and integrating Firebase into Flutter is actually also pretty straightforward.

25
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.540
But what do I mean when I say fully managed back and service?

26
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.810
What is Firebase all about in the end?

27
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.780
Well, Firebase consists of a bunch of cool services.

28
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.350
For example, it comes with data storage, with a data base, and that comes with an API that makes

29
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.710
talking through the database easy to be precise.

30
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.290
It also comes with a bunch of sticks.

31
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.490
So with a bunch of packages which you can install in, for example, flutter apps to make working with

32
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.410
Firebase Extra simple.

33
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.010
Now, besides the database for storing data, Firebase, for example, also has a file storage for,

34
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.740
you guessed it, storing files and uploading files with the FIREBASE SDK, which we're going to do in

35
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.530
this module, will also be extra simple.

36
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.730
Firebase also comes with built in authentication services so that you can easily add authentication

37
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.950
to your app without having to write your own logic for that, which can be fairly difficult and which

38
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.940
of course, also has to be done right to avoid security issues.

39
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.780
Now, Firebase also comes with a push notification service, which makes sending push notifications

40
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.250
to both Android as well as IOC apps very, very easy.

41
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.860
And we're going to utilize this in this module as well.

42
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.460
And Firebase also has more than that.

43
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.420
It comes with analytic services.

44
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.750
You can run server side code with a feature called Cloud Functions if you need to do that so that you

45
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.590
can run your own code and not just talk to their pre configure database.

46
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.600
And it has much, much more.

47
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.080
We're not going to explore everything here because this, of course, is a flutter.

48
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.280
Of course, not a firebase course, but we'll use some of the coolest feature in detail in this module,

49
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.620
to be precise.

50
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.460
We're going to work with the data storage database, with the file storage and authentication.

51
00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.280
And we'll also see some on the server side code in action with all of those cloud functions.

52
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.450
So a lot of stuff to do.

53
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.500
Let's get started with an app and let's start building that app and let's then step by step at Cool

54
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.240
Firebase features to it.
