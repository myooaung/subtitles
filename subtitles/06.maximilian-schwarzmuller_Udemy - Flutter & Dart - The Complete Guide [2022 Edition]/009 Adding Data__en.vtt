00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.800
Whilst it is nice that we can see our messages here, it would be nice if the plus button would at least

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.110
add some dummy message.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.170
So that's what we're going to do now.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.020
We have the plus button already.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.920
We got the unpressed handler for the plus button.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.580
So now all we need to do is we need to make sure that a new message is added.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.470
And for that, we can again use Firestorm, for instance, and reach out to the collection where we

8
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.720
want to add a document, and that's this same collection to which we're listening here in the Stream

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.130
Builder.

10
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.930
So let's add here.

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.860
But now we don't call snapshots because I'm not interested in the snapshots.

12
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.050
Instead, we can call ad and ad will do what the name sounds like.

13
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.780
It adds a new document.

14
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.590
Now on the flutter side, a new document is represented by a map.

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.990
And you create maps and start by using opening and closing curly braces like this.

16
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.810
And then you can add key value pairs, which will be the key value pairs in your document.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.240
And dear, we can add a text key because we're using text and the other documents as well.

18
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.630
And add any text of your choice like this was added by clicking the button.

19
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.530
And for now, it's hardcoded later will, of course, fetch some user input here.

20
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.930
So if he saved us again, we'll see two entries, but if I now click the plus you see it, this was

21
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.400
added by clicking the button.

22
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.100
You see, the order is a bit strange.

23
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.930
The order comes around.

24
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.090
But you see that's getting added here.

25
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.960
And you also see that's getting added here on the back end.

26
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.550
And if you click through here, you see the order we have here actually is the same order as in the

27
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.220
Flutter app we got.

28
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.870
This is a no entry as to bottommost, and that's the case here as well.

29
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.480
No, don't worry about that order thing right now.

30
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.620
We'll take care about this later and we'll make sure that everything is ordered correctly.

31
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.900
With that, however, we have this basic introduction to Firebase.

32
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.310
We saw how we can connect Firebase to the flutter app and we see how that data base flutter communication

33
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.720
generally works.

34
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.690
Now, of course, that's not everything we're going to do in this module actually does quite a bit away

35
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.950
from the final result.

36
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.620
But this is a super important first step.

37
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.710
With that, however, we're going to take a step back.

38
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.010
We're going to work on the styling a little bit.

39
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.090
We're going to add the authentication screen and we're going to start from scratch and make sure that

40
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.760
we have some users before we then work on allowing those users to send messages.
