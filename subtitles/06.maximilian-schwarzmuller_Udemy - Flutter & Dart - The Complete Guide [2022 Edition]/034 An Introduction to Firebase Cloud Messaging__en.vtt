00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.740
Now you can Google for FCMB, which stands for Firebase Cloud Messaging, to find your official Firebase

2
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.320
Cloud messaging docs, and there you can learn more about that and also learn more about the issues

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.960
and Android set up, though you shouldn't go through those steps right now, will go through them together.

4
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.280
And in flutters case, we need to deviate from these steps here, at least in some points.

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.770
So don't go through them here.

6
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.400
But if you ever work on a non flutter app, that might be useful.

7
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.660
It's also worth noting that you can also use the firebase cloud messaging service to send push notifications

8
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.360
to Web apps, but we're not going to focus on that here now.

9
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.180
You can also learn more about the architecture behind that here, and that essentially is the architecture

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.100
I described.

11
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.300
You have some way of creating a message, of creating a notification.

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.320
You then let the firebase cloud messaging service know about this.

13
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.770
And this then uses different transport layers for Android and iOS and so on to deliver it to the devices.

14
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.830
So that's essentially what I described here.

15
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040
But if you want to read more about that, this is your documentation.

16
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.640
And then you also get this about FCMB Messages article, which deeply dives into notifications.

17
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.130
You can send different kinds of notifications you can send and all you might want to know about push

18
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.970
notifications.

19
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.870
In this course, I will rather focus on how to make it work instead of covering all possible kinds of

20
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.330
push notifications you could send if that is something you're interested in and if you need a specific

21
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.490
use case for your next application.

22
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.920
The official docs here, therefore, are the way to go to learn all about it.

23
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.000
Essentially, there is one thing that is worth noting, and that is that you have two main kinds of

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.630
messages.

25
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.560
You have notification messages and you have data messages.

26
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.040
Notification messages are your default push notifications that pop up on the device, even if the device

27
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.530
is in lock mode or if the app is running in the background and you can then tap those notifications

28
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.760
to be taken to the app.

29
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.460
Data messages are a bit different from that.

30
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.970
They're meant to transport data, for example, to you're already running app to update some data in

31
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.980
there from behind the scenes, for example.

32
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.920
So the traditional push notification and the push notification we're going to look into in this module

33
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.680
will be this notification message here.

34
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.860
So that is the overview, that is firebase cloud messaging and what you need to know about it, of course,

35
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.550
you should also check out the pricing page for a cloud messaging to avoid any unwanted costs.

36
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.740
But as you can see currently, cloud messaging here is free and we therefore shouldn't face any issues

37
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.460
at the moment.

38
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.890
Still, that is a document that is worth checking out if you plan on using that in your real app.

39
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.170
Now with that.

40
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.700
You can, of course, search for flutter cloud messaging to find the official firebase messaging Flattr

41
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.370
package.

42
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.490
So just like the other flutter packages which be added like Firebase of firebase storage and cloud firestorm.

43
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.810
This is a package which you can add to your flutter project to prepare it for push notifications and

44
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.730
to handle push notifications.

45
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.450
So therefore we should definitely go through this set up at installation steps here.

46
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.980
Now, the first step is that we click on installing and we just wrap this dependency and then go to

47
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.080
the pub aspect on YAML file and added here, like we added all the other firebase packages.

48
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.940
But that's not all we need to do.

49
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.810
Instead, now we got specific set up steps for Android and fervor down below, also for iOS.

50
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.080
And yes, we've got a couple of steps there.

51
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.590
There are a couple of steps we need to go through because push notifications set up is a bit more complex

52
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.210
because of the reasons I outlined on the slide a few minutes ago.

53
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.410
So let's start with Android here.

54
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.970
I will also show the entire I push notification process, though.

55
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.260
One important note, you can test push notifications on the Android emulator for iOS.

56
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.570
You need a real iOS device, though.

57
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.920
You can't test push notifications on iOS simulator's.

58
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.870
That is simply a restriction imposed by Apple and there is nothing I can do about that.

59
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.850
So with that, let's get started with the Android integration in the next lecture.
