00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.370
Now, in order to run the application on my real estate device.

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.830
Which I have connected here, first of all, I need to go to Xcode.

3
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:22.000
And then to my project here and under signing and capabilities, she was my team here.

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.740
So that this error which was shown here goes away.

5
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.180
And with that, I could not launch it for this button, but I can now also try launching it here again

6
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.150
through visual pseudocode and this should now work and hopefully successfully build this application

7
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.760
for us and launch it on my iPhone.

8
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.930
Now, as a side note, if you should be getting any errors whilst you try to run this on the real iOS

9
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.970
device, try running, flutter clean in your project and then try restarting.

10
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.470
That's what I just needed to do.

11
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.940
But with that here on the right, you see my I was the wise and I'm going to sign up there.

12
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.120
Since I cleared all data, I can, of course, use all those email addresses here again.

13
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
So that's that now I'm going to pick an image.

14
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.850
Grant access to my camera and here I am taking a picture of me taking a picture.

15
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.510
Right, use that photo.

16
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.060
Here it is in our press sign up, and that's looking good.

17
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.050
I'm on the chat screen and if we now go back here and we refresh the users here on authentication,

18
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.250
I see that new user under storage.

19
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.700
I hopefully see my image.

20
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.960
Here it is.

21
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.490
That's the image I just took.

22
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.040
And under database, I also see the users collection with data about that user I just created.

23
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.880
So that is all looking great.

24
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.300
That seems to work on Aiwass as well.

25
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.740
And with that with that working well, let's actually continue and let's make sure that we show a user

26
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.620
image on all the chat messages we have.
