00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
Friends here or construct ease moto three.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.020
A neutron meant setup on Linux server to work with AWS services.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.790
See before continuing with this video,

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.100
please go and watch our previous video that is

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.250
moto three environments set up on Windows Server to work with.

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.085
Oedipus says, let me continue with this.

7
00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:23.355
C in order to configure database programmatic access keys on our local server,

8
00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.250
we need to install AWS, see enlight.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.960
So to install your AWS LA,

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
you have to go with p63 install AWS silane.

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.645
Now let me open my Amazon Linux.

12
00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:35.340
Let me drive it.

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.410
Pip3 installed AWS, see enlight and observe the output.

14
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.050
See you are getting something called permission denied while installing the package.

15
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.630
Right? This module.

16
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.350
Now, see, because you're on Linux,

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.510
if you want to install any packages,

18
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.830
you had to go with the root.

19
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.775
Odd in case if you want to install that particular module,

20
00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:04.145
AWS TLA only for your current user,

21
00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:07.440
then you can use option called hyphen iPhone user.

22
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.280
Let's say.

23
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.820
If you're the root user directly,

24
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.770
you can then P53 install NWC.

25
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.220
Unlike in case if you don't have root privileges to run

26
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.110
this p3 than simply run pip install AWS ELA hyphen iPhone user,

27
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.730
that this AWS ELA will be installed for your current user.

28
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.865
Let's say. Now we have our AWS silane.

29
00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:34.955
Then next step is you need to configure your credentials.

30
00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:38.120
See already we have taken programmatic access keys of

31
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.585
root account and 2m users in our previous video,

32
00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:46.430
let me configure these keys on my local host that is on Linux server.

33
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.200
So simply, you know, the command to configure your programmatic access keys, that is,

34
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.035
AWS, configure hyphen, hyphen profile.

35
00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.915
Suppose I am configuring for root first.

36
00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:06.300
Then just pass the keys. Access key ID.

37
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.520
Then you will secret access key.

38
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.560
Suppose here I am providing default region name as US East one.

39
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.325
Then default output format as the Sun.

40
00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:29.720
Then let me take the IAM user credentials.

41
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.135
You can provide it any profile name,

42
00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:38.010
but it's better to take same as your IAM user name so that you don't get confused.

43
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.630
Now let me pause the credentials.

44
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.450
Here I am giving one.

45
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.830
Now let me configure programmatic access keys for another IAM user.

46
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.910
So we configure programmatic access keys.

47
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.850
I am users on our Amazon Linux on what you've done automatically,

48
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.015
there is a directory dot database there it will be created and see that there is an AWS.

49
00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:42.800
Let me navigate into that and see that there are two files.

50
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.780
One is about credentials,

51
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.135
and the second one is abode config.

52
00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:49.970
So credentials file consists of what?

53
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.080
Butler profile limb with programmatic access keys.

54
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.315
And config file consists of your profile,

55
00:03:57.315 --> 00:03:59.615
him with the default output and region meme.

56
00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:00.230
That's right.

57
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.445
So there's a simple way to configure your programmatic access keys on you what?

58
00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:05.915
Linux server.

59
00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:08.960
So by these weak completed moto,

60
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.800
three environments set up on Windows and also on Linux server.

61
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.650
So in our next session we will see how to implement

62
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.500
Bhutto three scripts. Okay, thank you.
