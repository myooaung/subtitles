1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,420
Friends here we're implementing simple Python Bluetooth rescale to list all snapshots.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,255
C, you can get your snapshot from your AWS account under your ec2 service,

3
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:13,905
just to open your ec2 service.

4
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:17,325
And there, if you go with Elastic Block Store,

5
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,725
there is an option called snapshots.

6
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:24,390
And he had a house to two snapshots under my US West One.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,235
Now let me try to get this information using Python Bhutto three skip.

8
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:31,290
So let me open my editor.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,145
So simply import your boater three.

10
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:38,640
So I have already taken script name as least all snapshot PY there.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,695
Let me create AWS management console.

12
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:46,085
I'm creating custom fission, simply Bhutto 3.Now,

13
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:50,480
Session.get session than just providing your profile name,

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,625
whatever the profiles you configured on your host, just take them.

15
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:01,790
So now let me create my EC2 Console either by using the source or climb through.

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,765
So here I'm implementing with the help of resource you just try with client.

17
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,545
I will show you the steps we just try with that. So resource.

18
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:12,410
Then what is the service name if you too,

19
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,380
because snapshots are available under EC2 Console,

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,300
then what is the region name?

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,625
So I don't want to go with the default region because now my region is US West One.

22
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:27,830
So let me take it. Now you how your EC2 Console in your hand.

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,370
The next step is you need to implement the logic to list all your snapshots.

24
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,960
What do your documentation.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,235
But agreed documentation, select your service.

26
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:42,650
So under available services,

27
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,665
go and set up your EC2.

28
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:49,715
Then we are implementing as of now using resource object,

29
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:51,365
opening your resource object.

30
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:54,725
You know, under resource object you have three set of operations.

31
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,289
And in the last operation you hope collections.

32
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,240
So I need to collect all my snapshots.

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,970
So there is option called snapshots. Click on that.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,545
And there is option called all.

35
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:09,050
By using that you can get your all snapshots.

36
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,795
See that EC2 dot snapshots dot all.

37
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:15,395
So here you see two is nothing but our object EC2 Console upset.

38
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:19,280
So simply paste it and modify that EC2 instead of EC2,

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,295
we have taken EC2 Console resource.

40
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:25,370
But these are the collection of snapshots.

41
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,765
So just take one by one out from the iterator using for loop.

42
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:34,140
So for each snap in this,

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,455
let me bring to your snap up the output.

44
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:43,940
It will take some time because it is going to get lots of snapshots,

45
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,360
even though if you have only two snaps in your account.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,635
So first let me show you the output of that.

47
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:54,680
We'll discuss why we are getting a lot of snapshots from this script.

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,140
So you have to wait for at least 30 seconds.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,795
Just wait and see.

50
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:12,020
It is going to display not off snap shots.

51
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,790
That's why he's taking some time.

52
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,405
See that?

53
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,460
How many snapshots you are getting.

54
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,570
Right?

55
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,255
Now you're getting that many number of snapshots.

56
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:31,880
Because if you observe on your console there is

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,065
a filter option here won't buy me or public slab federal private snapshots.

58
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:40,655
So what are the snapshots you need owned by you or someone else?

59
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,365
Private or public.

60
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:47,975
Right? So now, instead of using all method on your collections,

61
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:52,395
go with a filter so that he can figure your required a snapshot.

62
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:57,250
Suppose if I want to filter based on size, based on availability,

63
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,665
Joan, based on availability,

64
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:03,310
based on status, then you have to sell it to these filters argument.

65
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,930
But as of now, I need based on a cone,

66
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,820
I need my worn snapshots.

67
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,389
Then there is a one more argument called Warner IDs.

68
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,910
So here, this one or ideas,

69
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,055
he's a list of a list.

70
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,650
That means you can provide here.

71
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,300
You are required.

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,760
Aws account ID is so that it is going to

73
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,880
fetch you a snapshot from that particular accounts.

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,100
Now, in case if you want to provide only your AWS account ID directly can poverty.

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,370
But we're also, we also

76
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,545
implemented a script to get your head unless account ID, let me get that.

77
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:46,310
C.

78
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,835
Simply, we are creating STS.

79
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:54,065
From STS, we are getting our AWS account ID.

80
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:56,340
So these are the steps, right?

81
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,350
So previously we implemented this.

82
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,940
Just from that I am taking let me modify it.

83
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,480
So whether you're reasoning is used to

84
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,985
one or two or three or account radius, same, right?

85
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:15,270
So now simply, this is the word,

86
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,410
this is Herodotus account ID.

87
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:32,430
Now just I'm providing that are let me take this India variable.

88
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,360
My wound ID equals two.

89
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,585
So you can probably hear a number of fewer AWS account IDs.

90
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:50,945
That's, you know, let me save it and run it and see the output.

91
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:54,960
What happened in values syntax.

92
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:03,630
Oh, snapshots, dot filter instead of that filter and how to apply this.

93
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,305
Now, see the output.

94
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:10,740
What you are going to get. You're going to get only you are two snapshots.

95
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,455
Right?

96
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,520
So that is the concept here to list your all snapshots which are

97
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,500
available in your particular region using your Python script.

98
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,745
And here we implemented this script using resource concept.

99
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:28,010
You can also implement using client object.

100
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,285
Let me show you the steps so that they can implement by your own.

101
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:35,790
Just go to your documentation.

102
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,140
Just open client object.

103
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,555
Under inclined you how Anyway,

104
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:43,370
underlined you how all options are?

105
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,260
I mean, all operations as a one side.

106
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,105
Just to go from top-down somebody how describes snapshots here?

107
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:55,760
Describe snapshots.

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,670
Just click on that that syntax.

109
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,355
You are client object, whatever you created

110
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:05,945
your EC2 Console using client object dot describe snapshots.

111
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:09,095
Then here, just apply inward owner ID.

112
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,365
That's it, so that you will get the output incomes of victory.

113
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,960
You just manipulate the output from that.

114
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,235
Let's say.

115
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,590
Okay, thank you for watching this video.
