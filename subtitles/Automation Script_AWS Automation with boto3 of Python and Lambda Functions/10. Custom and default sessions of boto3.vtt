00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.920
Friends here our concept is voter three session concept.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.560
So you already, we had a small discussion on this concept.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.175
So shun concept simply session is nothing but

4
00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:15.510
creating AWS management console through your Python Bhutto three scripts.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.000
And we already created that with the syntax called

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.940
moto three dots Session.get session with some profiling.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.150
But we can create two types of sessions while implementing

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.240
your Python Bhutto, three scripts or like customization and default station.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.535
C, whatever the discussion we had till now,

10
00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:33.320
that is all about customization.

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.225
Let me show you that once again.

12
00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:38.750
So before going to create your custom station, now very first step,

13
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.610
what we are doing is we are getting

14
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.645
programmatic access keys of either root account or any particular IAM user.

15
00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.210
And we're configuring them on

16
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.860
our local host with a syntax called database configured hyphen,

17
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.650
hyphen profile with some profile name.

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.620
So that profile name, maybe anything.

19
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.785
So once you've done that automatically under user home dot AWS directory will be created.

20
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:11.270
And under this, after configuring your credentials to files are

21
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.760
creating when his credentials file and one Maurice config file.

22
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.280
So in credentials file,

23
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.365
with respect to your profile name,

24
00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:23.495
your credentials are storing.

25
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.780
It may be rude account or any IAM user.

26
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.740
Right?

27
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.960
And from this, we are creating a session AWS management console.

28
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.360
Now let me copy this.

29
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.495
So once you've done this,

30
00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:44.880
what we are doing, let me go to our previous scripts.

31
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.580
See we are importing Bhutto three.

32
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.600
Then after that we are creating our AWS management console with the help of this syntax.

33
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.310
So here we can

34
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.890
use either route profile or any other IAM profile name also, what is your wish?

35
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.110
So if you want to work with the root privileges of

36
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.275
your analyser can just go and create with Profile Name as root,

37
00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:16.790
R with Butler, I am USA.

38
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.775
Then go and take that perfect name here.

39
00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:20.780
That's fine.

40
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.700
So this is about customization.

41
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.250
So once if we get customization into your hand,

42
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.260
then if you want to walk with IAM,

43
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.580
are easy to our S3,

44
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.495
you are going to create that particular service console with alcove,

45
00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:34.745
the resource or client.

46
00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:40.250
So suppose, let me copy this.

47
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.780
So I am going to create a game console with the help of a resource.

48
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.100
Using resource, of course here you can provide service name equals to.

49
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.355
Please follow this antagonists is better one.

50
00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:57.470
And region name.

51
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.030
You can provide any region name.

52
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.320
That's it. So same console you can

53
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.845
also create with the help of client method, client object.

54
00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:12.050
So simply, instead of resource,

55
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.645
you can write client. But after this

56
00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:16.910
If you want to implement your complete logic,

57
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.065
then your steps may vary. But concept is same.

58
00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:22.445
That's fine.

59
00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:25.925
So this is all about your customization.

60
00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:32.300
Now, you are having the other session to create your analyst management console,

61
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.165
that is default session means you need to

62
00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:39.155
create your AWS management console by default beautifully will create.

63
00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:42.185
But how voted three will understand our board dark.

64
00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:45.665
Now, see that first,

65
00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:49.190
I'm deleting my existing credentials from my database.

66
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.595
Dot AWS. Let me delete that.

67
00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:55.460
So dot AW, their trees there under user home.

68
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.765
I'm deleting it.

69
00:03:56.765 --> 00:04:01.805
This concept is applicable even on your Unix-like systems also.

70
00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:03.140
Fine.

71
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.440
Now, see that what I am doing is previously to

72
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.010
configure the credentials of your particular route or I am users,

73
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.710
we are following the syntax called AWS,

74
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.205
configured hyphen, hyphen profile than we are plotting profile name.

75
00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.485
Now I'm not providing any profile name,

76
00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:21.390
simply I'm running database configured.

77
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.490
So that now let me get my database access KID allele, we cooperate, right?

78
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.865
So once you've done this,

79
00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:38.690
I will show you how you were credentials.

80
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.340
Let me US East One Son.

81
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.805
Now let me navigate into dot AWS and see that there are two files.

82
00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:54.110
There is no change in the number of files. See the credentials.

83
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.970
We owe any name here

84
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.380
previously while configuring your connection with the help of Configure hyphen,

85
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.885
hyphen profile, there is a profile name.

86
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.805
It may be any profile.

87
00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:07.565
But now while configuring,

88
00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:10.355
we are not providing any profile name.

89
00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:12.920
Simply we ran AWS configure.

90
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.375
So because of that,

91
00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:18.545
you are both O3 is assigning a profile limb called default.

92
00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:21.200
Now with the help of this default,

93
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.815
in case if default profile name in your credentials,

94
00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.080
then you are bored or three can able to create

95
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.630
default session if you don't mention any profile name.

96
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.924
Now, for one profile,

97
00:05:34.924 --> 00:05:38.600
we did didn't provide it any profile him for that's why boater

98
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.380
that has been taken for profile name as default.

99
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.465
Now what I will do is we do this,

100
00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:48.875
we to this profile,

101
00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:53.030
the default profile, how we can implement it, Python scripts.

102
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.315
So let me navigate into our right. He's not a tree.

103
00:05:56.315 --> 00:06:00.620
So here let me open list.

104
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.810
I am users only.

105
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.820
And see that. Now in this case, I will do one thing.

106
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.990
I will come in the score.

107
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.060
Now see that what I'm doing.

108
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.740
Now I am not going to create any AWS management console directly.

109
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:27.065
I'm going to create IAM console equals to both u3 dot resource.

110
00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:30.965
Ibm can guess if you want write service name.

111
00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:35.030
You can write it. Anyway, that is default argument.

112
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.215
Let's say.

113
00:06:36.215 --> 00:06:38.750
Now we are not creating any database management console.

114
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.360
I commented these two lenses directly.

115
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.540
I'm creating my IAM console that is

116
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.410
with the syntax called Bordeaux 3.Now you are resource our client.

117
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.720
Now let me see we in case if you have any confusion,

118
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.180
let me probably even region name as well.

119
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.965
You can provide any region in here because this is about I am.

120
00:07:00.965 --> 00:07:01.985
That's it.

121
00:07:01.985 --> 00:07:03.515
No, let me save it.

122
00:07:03.515 --> 00:07:04.655
And I'm running.

123
00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:07.740
So before running C or code once,

124
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.425
now we are running this. See the output.

125
00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:21.395
You are able to get the word IAM user names.

126
00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:25.700
We did not provided any profile name while implementing

127
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.930
your Python Bhutto transcripts or we did not created any fission,

128
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.590
any analyst management console in our Bhutto three scapes automatically.

129
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.389
Bhutto three is creating

130
00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:41.810
your AWS management console by taking profile name as before, and that's it.

131
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.030
So in case, just assume that you are having some number

132
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.410
of IAM users are some router Content Summary and users,

133
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.535
in that case, it is better to follow this syntax.

134
00:07:55.535 --> 00:07:58.535
Suppose you have only one profile.

135
00:07:58.535 --> 00:08:01.790
Suppose you are going to walk with only some IAM user.

136
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.060
You don't have any access with root or any particular other IAM users.

137
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.015
You are having only one IAM user credentials in your hand.

138
00:08:08.015 --> 00:08:10.430
At the time, you don't need to provide

139
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.250
the profile limb buried ligand anatomist configure command

140
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.900
and you just pass, you will credentials.

141
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.645
So that voted three will create a default session,

142
00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:19.175
our default profile name.

143
00:08:19.175 --> 00:08:23.990
And that default profile name will be useful to create a default session.

144
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.225
Nice incase if you are getting confusion,

145
00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:28.865
it is the best practice to follow.

146
00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:31.310
Simply edit list configure i for a given profile.

147
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.260
Then with respect to your profile name,

148
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.400
it may be rude or any IAM user just follow that step.

149
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.865
So better to follow customisation steps.

150
00:08:40.865 --> 00:08:43.535
In case if you want to follow default session,

151
00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:45.185
Yes, we can also follow,

152
00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:51.515
suppose I want to take default session and also Butler profile and yes, you can take it.

153
00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:58.700
Now. See that already we have under river Let me go

154
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:08.000
to I'm going to

155
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.085
be how you or default session here.

156
00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:12.650
So you have to assume that these default station you are given

157
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.920
for these credentials and these credentials of R2P.

158
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.030
Now, I have some I am users also, then, no problem.

159
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.810
You can even provide with some profiles even by including your default

160
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.910
also already default session is that now I am

161
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.490
providing edible is configured iPhone5 profile.

162
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.770
Easy to nola PR.

163
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.420
That's it.

164
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.150
No, let me take my EC2 developer keys.

165
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.690
That's it.

166
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.430
Now let me show you your credentials.

167
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.985
So by default session is there.

168
00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:55.925
By default your profile is the default profile under the,

169
00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:57.395
under the easy $2 per.

170
00:09:57.395 --> 00:10:00.290
Now while implementing your Python Port-au-Prince kids,

171
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.470
suppose if I want to work with the default session,

172
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.605
then simply import Buddha three.

173
00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:09.905
Then whatever the console you want to create,

174
00:10:09.905 --> 00:10:12.800
create that console by using either resource,

175
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.985
our client simply boater three dot source,

176
00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:18.800
then you are, I am.

177
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.120
This is one way.

178
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.510
Suppose I want to work with easy to tell apart,

179
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.220
work with EC2 services,

180
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.820
then create your database management console in the same script in

181
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.540
case if you want to work with the easy $2 per profile, yes,

182
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.305
you can create it simply by using Bhutto 3.Now session,

183
00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:43.175
session, then Profile Name as EC2 dollar per easy to underscore.

184
00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:45.900
No upper. That's it.

185
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.565
Now from this you just create your EC2 Console.

186
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:52.715
Ec2 Console using resource or client, that is your wish.

187
00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:56.465
Because for easy too, we have both the options, client and resource.

188
00:10:56.465 --> 00:11:00.139
Now AWS management console,

189
00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:06.059
dot resource, then simply provide your EC2.

190
00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:11.110
So if we want to provide clearly than simply write service name equals to EC2.

191
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.225
And if you want to work with the particular region,

192
00:11:13.225 --> 00:11:15.280
then region name equals two.

193
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:22.795
You were region, whatever the region you want us to,

194
00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:24.745
something like that. That's it.

195
00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:31.870
Now after this, you are logic into the steps to implement your logic is sim,

196
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.860
whether you are going to work with the default or custom, Right?

197
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.350
So don't get confused. It's very simple.

198
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.720
In case you are getting confusion.

199
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.110
Basically just to follow our customization concept.

200
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.390
That is the good practice, right?

201
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.315
C Now, let me do the steps.

202
00:11:49.315 --> 00:11:53.390
The only thing with this is customization right?

203
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.780
Now, default session.

204
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.950
So make sure that if you want to walk with the default session in your credentials files,

205
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.240
you should have one default,

206
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.755
a profile name called default,

207
00:12:05.755 --> 00:12:08.529
then only you are boarded three, we pick that credentials.

208
00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:16.430
So simply directly import moto three rather than directly create your any console.

209
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.655
Moto three dot or resource or client.

210
00:12:21.655 --> 00:12:25.300
Then suppose I am more specific,

211
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.710
service name equals two,

212
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:33.220
I am region name equals 21,

213
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.420
or two or three c1,

214
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:40.690
we see only extra step is this one in consumption.

215
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.135
So if you create custom fission,

216
00:12:43.135 --> 00:12:47.215
you how to create your game console with respect to this customization dot.

217
00:12:47.215 --> 00:12:49.975
But in default session directly Bhutto three dot.

218
00:12:49.975 --> 00:12:54.715
Now, to implement your Python Bhutto three scripts,

219
00:12:54.715 --> 00:12:57.760
we have a official documentation.

220
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.010
Let me show you that simply as such with

221
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:05.350
moto three documentation and open this very first link.

222
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:15.630
Right now, go to here available services and see that you are all AWS services are here.

223
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.140
Suppose I want to work with I am,

224
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.350
then go and such with IMR EC2.

225
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.245
Ec2 in EC2.

226
00:13:24.245 --> 00:13:26.420
Don't go with all options as of now,

227
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.365
just concentrate on client or service resource.

228
00:13:30.365 --> 00:13:32.240
This is our client option.

229
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.815
This is resource option.

230
00:13:33.815 --> 00:13:36.215
If you click on a resource or client,

231
00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:37.850
you can go with anyone of that, right?

232
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.160
Let me click on service resource.

233
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.905
Now.

234
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:45.950
See that there are importing Bhutto three and they're

235
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.655
creating EC2 Console simply by taking Bhutto 3.What source?

236
00:13:49.655 --> 00:13:55.145
That means official documentation completely on default session.

237
00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:59.345
But anyone realtime in case if you are working with multiple profiles,

238
00:13:59.345 --> 00:14:01.205
you may get confused.

239
00:14:01.205 --> 00:14:04.235
Right? That's why just follow customization.

240
00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:05.825
So this is official step,

241
00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:07.430
official documentation steps, right?

242
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.985
These are now why in following this documentation,

243
00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:12.650
you have to assume in this way,

244
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.725
you are going to create your management console.

245
00:14:15.725 --> 00:14:20.885
You are AWS management console, 123 dot.

246
00:14:20.885 --> 00:14:30.590
Let me copy it down here.

247
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.085
Just take AWS management console.

248
00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:36.500
So after that, what are the steps we are having

249
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.275
enough in our official documentation, just follow them.

250
00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:42.845
That's it. Alright, don't get confused.

251
00:14:42.845 --> 00:14:48.320
You were official documentation is completely on default session, but in real time.

252
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.425
But in your real time, most of the cases,

253
00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:54.425
you will create some profile names and you will walk on that.

254
00:14:54.425 --> 00:15:00.530
Say suppose some of the diapers will how access only for EC2,

255
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.475
S3, and some of the developer there having access for RDS and S3.

256
00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:07.730
That's why, you know, in real time they're going to get some IAM user

257
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.285
signed with that butler I am user they're providing could instance to you.

258
00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:14.090
That's why you're going to create your going to configure credentials on

259
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.320
your host from where you are working with your AWS or cone on that host,

260
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.150
you will configure it with some profile names,

261
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.055
and that is the best practice.

262
00:15:22.055 --> 00:15:23.450
Okay?

263
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.080
Okay, anyway, you will get more help on

264
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.290
this documentation while implementing our Python moto three scripts,

265
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.710
I will show you how to implement your Python booty that

266
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.760
escapes with respect to by considering your official documentation.

267
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.540
Okay? Okay, thank you.
