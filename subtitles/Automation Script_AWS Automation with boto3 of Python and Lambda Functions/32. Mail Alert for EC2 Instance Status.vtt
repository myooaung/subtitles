00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.260
Hi friends. In this video,

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.210
we are going to see how to send mail alert based on your requirement.

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.380
Suppose in my case,

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.045
I'm taking one example.

5
00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:19.110
That is how one prod server,

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.035
let's say that isn't running status.

7
00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:28.350
And suppose if because of some reason in case if it enters into Stop At the time,

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.090
I want to get mail alert.

9
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.355
Then how you can do these things with your lambda, right?

10
00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:42.085
So first I will start with your basic information that, you know, already.

11
00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.510
Write your Lambda code.

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.105
And already we have seen that right in these two videos.

13
00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:50.660
Right?

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.705
Now I'm going to work with a different concept.

15
00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.745
So the first thing,

16
00:00:55.745 --> 00:01:00.200
you're going to write your code using lambda function.

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.115
You know, lambda function needs one IAM role instead of your programmatic access keys.

18
00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:10.970
Now our concept is we are going to write a function to

19
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.275
get easy to instance status and you want to send that to me.

20
00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:20.810
That means you are roles should have a policies such that easy to access and SNS,

21
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.664
because here I am going to use SMS to send your mains.

22
00:01:24.664 --> 00:01:30.030
First, let me check it whether I'm having a role or not with this information.

23
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.530
So this is my role.

24
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.165
I mean, under my roles,

25
00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:39.710
let me open one of the roll-call male alert lambda.

26
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.320
So here if you observe in our policies,

27
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.520
I attach a two policies.

28
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.845
One is for your EC2 full axis and one is for my SNS full axis, right?

29
00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:51.110
So you knew in order to give full access,

30
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.309
you can read only read access because you are going to try to get the status.

31
00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:56.660
That's fine.

32
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.290
Now create a lambda with moto three of

33
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.815
Python is application of your lambda.

34
00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:12.890
Don't forget to assign your role to your lambda.

35
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.330
Because if you don't assign role,

36
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.729
you will get an error exception like you are are to having permissions

37
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.130
or you are not the authorized user or you don't now

38
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.235
punish and denied something like that, you will get an exception.

39
00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:28.310
That fine. Let me open my lambda console.

40
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.065
I'm going to create a new function here.

41
00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:33.740
Create a function.

42
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.230
Let me start from scratch a 100 mili function.

43
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.290
Namely suppose male alert for broad servers less,

44
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.775
I'm going to walk with one server.

45
00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:50.425
You can test your concept by applying this for multiple servers.

46
00:02:50.425 --> 00:02:51.940
Kind of specificity.

47
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.130
Lee, I'm going to work with one server.

48
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.895
Let me take that server instance ID.

49
00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:05.005
Suppose this is Instance ID I want to use in my case. Okay?

50
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.330
Now, in newer lambda,

51
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.560
yes, it's creating write.

52
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.540
Once it is created, Let me take it.

53
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.565
For instance, IT S, it has been created.

54
00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.620
Once it is created, you know,

55
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.980
you just go on and use your rule for your use

56
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.090
existing role and selective or what is your role?

57
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.080
Male alert, lambda role. Just save it.

58
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.130
And before going to save it,

59
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.240
let me change the execution time to suppose some five minutes,

60
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.950
three seconds, or five minutes, simply.

61
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.085
The trick.

62
00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:54.925
Now come here. I mean, you are lambda.

63
00:03:54.925 --> 00:04:02.525
So guys here first tried to get for particularly EC2 instance, that status.

64
00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:05.030
So first I will manually check the code.

65
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.740
I mean, I will run this manually.

66
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.870
And after that I will show you how automatically you

67
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.345
can get mail alerts whenever you feel your sorrow state.

68
00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:13.100
Reached to stop.

69
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.235
Find, let me import my moto three.

70
00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:21.275
So I need easily to console, right?

71
00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.495
And case here I'm going to use resource method

72
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.580
and I'm not going to create any session object

73
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.470
because by default your session will be

74
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.080
created based on your role with the help of your Bhutto three,

75
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.800
so directly use birthrate dot a resource.

76
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.064
You are EC2, then work under US east region.

77
00:04:39.064 --> 00:04:42.515
That's it. Now I need some SNS.

78
00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:45.140
I'm going to create a sentence using client as of now guys,

79
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.150
you don't know how to work with your SNS.

80
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.705
But while going forward I will upload the videos for or even SNS also.

81
00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:54.200
But for time being, just try to understand how to work with,

82
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.575
I mean, just see the aligns Nazi moto three.

83
00:04:57.575 --> 00:04:59.420
I'm using client for this.

84
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.570
I mean, I wanted to work with us and as let say,

85
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.805
suppose US East One.

86
00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:08.165
That's it. Now guys,

87
00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:10.685
I have to work with one single EC2 instance, right?

88
00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:15.320
So V, How already one separate section to work with to one EC2 instance.

89
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.000
It just to go through this video so that you will get how

90
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.070
to work with one EC2 instance, right?

91
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.870
So now I'm going to create my required instance from

92
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.095
your institute console dot instant just to provide you an instance ID that's right.

93
00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:34.560
Now let me print the current status of your instance.

94
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.780
And I want to exactly only the status name.

95
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.450
I don't want to get a core.

96
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.245
Save it and tested before going to test it,

97
00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:47.315
it needs at least one dummy event.

98
00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:48.830
You are lambda function.

99
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.385
Whether you are going to use your eventing our core or not, that's a secondary.

100
00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.275
Markets need at least one dummy.

101
00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:56.960
Test it, and check, check the,

102
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.095
your current status of your EC2 instance.

103
00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:01.970
So yeah, it has been executed.

104
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.475
See, now you're getting your instance dataset stop.

105
00:06:04.475 --> 00:06:07.190
If you observe here it is in stop and status.

106
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.270
Right?

107
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.815
Now let me run it and see the status when you are using your lambda moto three chord.

108
00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:19.620
Okay, let me start it.

109
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.020
So anyway will enter into some different status.

110
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.275
Now I'm going to read on our core and see the output instead of stop,

111
00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:29.510
you will get some different value pending. Yes, it's working.

112
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.240
Our code is working. Now I want to send

113
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.680
this information to my mail surveys you can send already.

114
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.150
You have your SNS client, right?

115
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.659
Just simply use public, sorry, publish.

116
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.725
Target, yea or N. So what is this year and means C, you know,

117
00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:56.495
you can send your mails using your SNS subscribers through the help of topic, right?

118
00:06:56.495 --> 00:07:01.820
So what I am doing is I already have a SNS topic in my AWS.

119
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.590
So I will use that SNS ER and to send my mail.

120
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.525
So as, as a as an analyst had been right,

121
00:07:11.525 --> 00:07:14.000
you already might know about this,

122
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.380
how to create topics are now to create subscriptions on auto send mails, right?

123
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.790
I mean, this through this in case if you are not aware of with this,

124
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.500
how to create topic sand,

125
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.125
to create a subscribe subscriptions, all those things,

126
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:30.020
just you, your comment with

127
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.035
your your messages to you in the form of comments so that I will prepare a video for you.

128
00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:36.965
Okay.

129
00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:38.105
That's okay.

130
00:07:38.105 --> 00:07:41.735
Not just go here and provide your year and offer that.

131
00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:43.265
What is the message you want to send?

132
00:07:43.265 --> 00:07:46.760
So I want to send the messages of whatever the message I am getting here.

133
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.105
That message I want to send to my mail lady.

134
00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:51.785
That's it.

135
00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:53.435
Just save it.

136
00:07:53.435 --> 00:07:58.505
And current status of your EC2 instances running.

137
00:07:58.505 --> 00:08:00.155
See that?

138
00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:04.865
So now as of now I don't have any mail alerts here from my topic.

139
00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:07.950
Now let me run the score and ticket.

140
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.135
Yeah, something wrong.

141
00:08:14.135 --> 00:08:15.990
What is that?

142
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.600
Target year and water. How given?

143
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.720
Spell mystic. Darn get.

144
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:31.950
That's fine. Save it and test it.

145
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:42.260
Successfully executed, right, just to go and see you. Let me refresh it.

146
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:48.140
My email IDC, you've got one new made edible is notification,

147
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.700
a message that is running, right?

148
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.560
So immensely, you'll get it guys here.

149
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.110
My net somewhat slow today.

150
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.555
So that's why it's somewhat late.

151
00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:05.360
But you will get in fraction of seconds your status pending status is there.

152
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.090
But here guys, if you anyway, you're getting right,

153
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.860
but here what you are doing is you are running

154
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.320
your core manual and you are able to get your mails.

155
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.495
But I don't want to get in that way.

156
00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:19.070
Whenever my EC2 instance state is stopped automatically,

157
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.100
I want to run the score and I want to get this status.

158
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.360
That means I want to trigger this whenever my instances goes stop state.

159
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.484
So for that guys, what you had to do easy just to go to your CloudWatch.

160
00:09:35.484 --> 00:09:37.645
Just create one rule.

161
00:09:37.645 --> 00:09:39.130
Okay.

162
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.545
Now, they saw while working,

163
00:09:41.545 --> 00:09:44.810
I know where we work, right?

164
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.140
Yeah, here. So we focus on what you are.

165
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.600
Cloudwatch, right?

166
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.675
And even here also I explained something like how to create a symbol.

167
00:09:55.675 --> 00:10:00.295
You can follow that so that you can create a your IAM bolts. That's fine.

168
00:10:00.295 --> 00:10:04.105
Just come here. So create rule.

169
00:10:04.105 --> 00:10:06.420
What is the rule you want to create?

170
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.810
So schedule you're not going to schedule it.

171
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.880
I mean, just check it off for every one hour,

172
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.930
two hours, three hours.

173
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.525
Not in that way. Exempt status.

174
00:10:14.525 --> 00:10:16.745
Whenever if the steady change to stop,

175
00:10:16.745 --> 00:10:19.100
then only I want to get automatically ME letter.

176
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.800
That's why you have to use pattern event a pattern.

177
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.870
What is this event festival?

178
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.450
So k, suppose your AWS,

179
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.570
we'll create some events, nothing but some data.

180
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.620
Whenever something happens, suppose you are going to upload some data to your S3.

181
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.175
So some action is doing right at that time automatically.

182
00:10:37.175 --> 00:10:38.794
What is happening?

183
00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:43.790
That data will be captured by your AWS and that is called the event.

184
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.020
Now the same way, suppose I am going to stop my EC2 instance.

185
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.345
Some action is doing,

186
00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:55.100
some data is modifying that data will be captured as an event with your AWS.

187
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.700
That's it.

188
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.010
Now my requirement is I want to capture

189
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.400
that data and I want to pass that data to my editor is lambda.

190
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.040
So now see, just select for what service you want to capture the data or event.

191
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.355
So I wanted to capture for my EC2 instance,

192
00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:14.450
what even you want to capture only stayed chain notification.

193
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.730
All changes are specific change.

194
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.170
So I need specific change only whenever if it is stop. All instances.

195
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.325
For one instance, I want to work with only 41 instance.

196
00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:28.160
So varies, for instance, ID.

197
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.200
Let me get it from here.

198
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:41.035
Okay? Then as Pacific, right, fine.

199
00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:45.610
And then it will capture whenever my

200
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:50.125
easy to instance reach it to stop restate it will do in the form of this data.

201
00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:51.460
In this way.

202
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.880
That data I want to pass to my lambda functions.

203
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.230
So our target. Now check,

204
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.615
then configure your details.

205
00:12:01.615 --> 00:12:04.495
Then do some rule, rule name.

206
00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:12.010
Mainly alert for broad servers.

207
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:18.170
Someday, description, create rule.

208
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.255
Now you have been created rule,

209
00:12:20.255 --> 00:12:21.680
so how it will work.

210
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.540
So as of no,

211
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.540
your instances running note in case by chance,

212
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.310
if this instance going down,

213
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:35.735
I mean stop, then automatically you are CloudWatch will get the that information.

214
00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:37.910
I mean, stop with straight information.

215
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.800
And you've created a rule.

216
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:45.290
What is that rule? This rule will trigger your lambda whenever he would.

217
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.325
Instances stalled because you are configuring this only for stop the status.

218
00:12:49.325 --> 00:12:53.315
And this data will pass to your lambda as an event variable.

219
00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:54.710
Now if you have done your lambda,

220
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.760
you are having one event.

221
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.500
No, this is a variable.

222
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.625
So this variable value is nothing but now this one,

223
00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:06.080
this information will come and store into your event variable.

224
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.000
If you want to use now this event,

225
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.095
you can use it. As of now.

226
00:13:09.095 --> 00:13:13.115
I am not going to use and I don't have any dependency on that.

227
00:13:13.115 --> 00:13:16.925
Only triggering I need.

228
00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:19.115
So that regrettable done by your edible is

229
00:13:19.115 --> 00:13:22.580
CloudWatch automatically whenever you are instances stop.

230
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.445
Now if you observe you guys here,

231
00:13:25.445 --> 00:13:28.085
you known enough this part,

232
00:13:28.085 --> 00:13:32.045
you don't bother about what is the status you are taking.

233
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:39.155
By automatically, this code will execute whenever you are easier to instance, God's stop.

234
00:13:39.155 --> 00:13:40.670
That's it.

235
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.145
Now in order to write any logic year only,

236
00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:45.485
just right to send stride forward,

237
00:13:45.485 --> 00:13:47.420
some status, some message.

238
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.095
So this lambda will execute whenever you are EC2 instance in stop.

239
00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:56.670
And I can say that at that time now your EC2 instances stopped status.

240
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.315
That's it. Just save it.

241
00:14:05.315 --> 00:14:11.075
Now you don't have anything. Just to go and assume because of some reason,

242
00:14:11.075 --> 00:14:15.005
you are instances going to down let me stop before going into that,

243
00:14:15.005 --> 00:14:20.550
let me remove my previously and got males from my topic.

244
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.845
Now, let me manually stop.

245
00:14:24.845 --> 00:14:27.770
Just imagine that you are not doing this because of some reason,

246
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:28.955
your instance, god, stop.

247
00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:30.515
Just assume that in that way.

248
00:14:30.515 --> 00:14:34.370
So you are stopping. But just unexpected f-stop.

249
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.720
Then just wait here and see.

250
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.495
Once it is successfully stopped.

251
00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:43.415
Let me refresh it.

252
00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:45.500
Still it is stopping once it is stopped,

253
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.065
but then only you will get a male because you are given a rule.

254
00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:50.060
Stop Yesterday's top right.

255
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.710
Just to go here.

256
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.815
See, you got just known mainly.

257
00:14:54.815 --> 00:15:00.300
Now the instance status means topless status. That's it.

258
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.979
In case if you run your instance,

259
00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:07.295
but now you don't get it because you are event,

260
00:15:07.295 --> 00:15:11.210
you configured your lambda2 trigger only if your event to

261
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:16.140
reach you to stop the status. Now I'm running, no.

262
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:25.530
Let me wait up to my instance reachable running status.

263
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.620
But during this you won't get any ME running, right?

264
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.260
See, you're not getting any Miles.

265
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.760
You won't get it because you configured only if you instances reaches top.

266
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.390
Right.

267
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.460
Now I once again, I will go and stop it.

268
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.755
I stopped right just after here.

269
00:15:54.755 --> 00:15:55.730
You will get an email alert.

270
00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:04.520
Now, once you successfully reach you to stop,

271
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.000
the status is still it is in stopping.

272
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.520
Stop right? Now, just wait here.

273
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.690
You will get an email alert now.

274
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.100
Just refresh it.

275
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.960
Seek you got it.

276
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.860
Right.

277
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.070
So previously May 1,

278
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.605
now you are having second male under same main, right?

279
00:16:36.605 --> 00:16:41.480
So now the instances Installed status, right?

280
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.910
This is just how you got into his previous, maybe.

281
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.690
That's

282
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.930
a

283
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.745
right.

284
00:16:55.745 --> 00:16:59.990
So in this way you can configure your lambda

285
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:05.075
such that you can trigger your lambda based on some events.

286
00:17:05.075 --> 00:17:07.370
Okay? So where are you going forward?

287
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:08.900
We will see lot of events,

288
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.375
how you can configure and how you can do that.

289
00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:16.835
So probably our next concept is like for complaints purpose,

290
00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:22.610
just imagine that you are having one easy to one security group.

291
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.530
And for that security group,

292
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:29.495
in case if you're inbound got change of than you are required quote,

293
00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:33.635
then are the time automatically I need to send a mail alert.

294
00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:35.330
Then how you can send that?

295
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.295
We will see in our next video.

296
00:17:37.295 --> 00:17:38.525
Okay.

297
00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:42.270
Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
