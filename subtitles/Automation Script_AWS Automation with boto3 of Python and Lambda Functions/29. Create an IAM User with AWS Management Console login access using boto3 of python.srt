00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,750
Hi friends. Here we are going to create an IAM user

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,730
with console login access with moto three of your python, right?

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,145
Simply you're creating one IAM user with console login access, right?

4
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:31,455
You know, you can provide to is access for your IAM user, right?

5
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:37,020
One is using programmatic access and one mode is using console access, right?

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,710
Okay, case C, before going to create an IAM user,

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,060
you should have some idea, right?

8
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,340
So that is like first thing,

9
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,740
whatever the IAM user name you want to create,

10
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,735
that user name you should have in your hand.

11
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:57,185
Then second, they want to provide programmatic access or console access or both.

12
00:00:57,185 --> 00:01:01,385
So based on that, you have to create your IAM user with moto three.

13
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:06,575
Then finally, what is the policy you want to attach with your IAM user?

14
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:12,845
All these things you should have in your hand before go into create your IAM user, right?

15
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:16,085
C, Let me go ahead and write our Python B23 script.

16
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,760
But before going to write each Tao some clarity, I will explain that.

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,130
So create an IAM user with

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:32,255
console login access dot pi.

19
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:36,230
Let me write it up in Python.

20
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,915
Then let me import Bordeaux three.

21
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:41,360
Then first, I am going to create a session.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,370
You know that how to create a session, right?

23
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:51,500
Simply your boater 3.Now Session.get expression profile underscore name.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,345
Using this profile, I wanted to create a new user.

25
00:01:56,345 --> 00:02:06,875
That's fine. Then create IAM object that you can create using resource or client.

26
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:12,650
But what is the object you can choose to achieve your required task?

27
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,170
Our task is created an IAM user with

28
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,015
console Eigen axis just to go to your official documentation first.

29
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:25,535
Right, that is moto three documentation. Gaze here.

30
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:29,870
Just observe your required operations are there with your resource or not,

31
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,245
or you are a square operations are there with your client or not?

32
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:33,905
Right.

33
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:42,770
Let me go with first I am I am right where it is.

34
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,680
Yeah. First I'm going to open

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,830
resource because always first I will prefer resource if incase,

36
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,190
if any option is not available in resource for your required operation,

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,285
then I will go with client.

38
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:55,730
And now if you observe here,

39
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,040
you are having create user base.

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,105
Before going into that,

41
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,890
let me go with your manual steps.

42
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,630
If you want to add a user, IAM user,

43
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,390
how you can do it, add user, right?

44
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,845
You're providing some name.

45
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:11,420
Let me take some x, y, z.

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,420
Then here you are assigning programmatic access keys or

47
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,050
AWS management console access. Right?

48
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,170
So if you want to both the heart to enable both, right?

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,200
Or if you want to only console axis,

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,660
you are to enable this and that to here.

51
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,755
Auto-generated password or custom password, that password.

52
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,920
And after that user must create

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,355
a new password on next assignment that is reset yes or no,

54
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:43,175
right, likewise, so that means offer giving your name.

55
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:50,360
You should able to create access keys or you should able to provide login access, right?

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,235
And you should able to provide password.

57
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:55,265
These all options are available with your resource or mark.

58
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:57,860
Since there is no availability with the resource,

59
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,315
because there is only create user,

60
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:02,345
there is no option called create access keys here.

61
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:05,315
The whole year. Create access keys, no.

62
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:09,290
Or do you have ligand profile option here? No.

63
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,480
Right. That's why I'm not going to select resource now because resource, you know,

64
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,240
in resource sometimes you may have a well a required option

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,315
or sometimes you may not have been inclined you how each and every option.

66
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:23,765
Now I am going to work with client for your IEP.

67
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:28,325
That is, first we need to create user, right?

68
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:32,630
So there is an option called CREATE_USER.

69
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,940
Let me open that. Create user is there.

70
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,040
After this, what you want,

71
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,979
you need to attach your policies are the unit to provide

72
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:51,065
access keys or management console like an axis, right?

73
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:55,490
So here if you observe here, create login profiling.

74
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,500
This is just to provide login access.

75
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,025
Right? Then one more thing,

76
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:10,190
attached policy, unless there is a one more option called create access keys.

77
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:17,450
But as of now you are going to create a user with comes with like an access.

78
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,225
We are not going to provide programmatic access keys.

79
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:23,600
That's why I don't want to create access keys.

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,310
I need to select this.

81
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,650
But I mean, I, I kinda option called attach policy, right?

82
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,210
See here, attached user policy.

83
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:42,485
Now you have three options which are available with your client. Right?

84
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:45,830
Now. Let me go and implement your Python Bordeaux that

85
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,235
escaped using IAM client a method, right?

86
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,085
So I am object I'm going to create using client

87
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,820
is nothing but simply you are Session.get client.

88
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,605
Let me write surveys underscore name equals two IAM.

89
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:06,650
And then after that, let me provide a region name has some us is

90
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,685
to one. That's fine.

91
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:13,630
Right?

92
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,700
See this, this is simply you are a session and I am Clint.

93
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,660
Ok.

94
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,205
Now, there is, I am going to write this program,

95
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,880
the state with the help of functions because a later

96
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,290
descript you can apply to create multiple IAM users.

97
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,945
As of now, you are going to take only one IAM user.

98
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:39,535
So I'm going to do an assignment like create multiple IAM users,

99
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:44,570
write that phi c. I'm going to create.

100
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,465
If underscore underscore name,

101
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:52,335
it is a better practice always to start your code.

102
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:58,535
In this way. So this is your Python basics guys.

103
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,175
So I am going to call main function.

104
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:05,210
Now, I'm going to create a function called main.

105
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,990
So under main, very first function I am going to create,

106
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:18,110
or simply I am client equals to this.

107
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,210
I'm going to get as a function,

108
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,840
get IAM client object.

109
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,660
Right now I am going to add these two lines under your function call.

110
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:41,480
You get IM client object,

111
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,685
profile underscore name equals two.

112
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:47,050
Okay?

113
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,700
By default, I am giving us,

114
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,490
if you want to work with the different profiles,

115
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,975
you can modify the script.

116
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:57,560
Right now I'm going to copy and paste it.

117
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,640
Right?

118
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,545
So now after this,

119
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:07,765
I need to return the object called IM.

120
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:11,020
Client. Got that.

121
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,540
I need, right?

122
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,920
Let me delete these two lines.

123
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,410
Fine.

124
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,190
Now in your hand you how IM client object.

125
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,935
So after that actually I need to create a IAM user.

126
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:27,080
So there's Before going to create your IAM user,

127
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,775
let me define some variables,

128
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,430
but gaze, while writing in the real-time script.

129
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,595
Note don't fix your variables here.

130
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:38,780
Instead of this, just create one CSV file there, just right.

131
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,669
Required I am username,

132
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,940
right? Or policy, right?

133
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,190
Whether you need console access our mode.

134
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,340
But here, as of now, for simplicity purpose,

135
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:55,430
I'm going to write IAM user name.

136
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,490
Let me write something called some.

137
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,810
Go with Python.

138
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,265
So if gmail.com,

139
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:13,420
So with this, I wanted to create an I am user.

140
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,380
Right?

141
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,660
So after that, let me take my I need password also.

142
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,490
Right off of these creation of user,

143
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,380
I need to set a login profile further.

144
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,750
I ate password, so password equals two.

145
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,789
You get random password.

146
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:44,420
So I want to define one more function to get my password, get random password.

147
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,265
So guys, we have one of the scraper to get password here.

148
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:52,860
Latter-day I'm going to copy and paste it.

149
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,920
Let me already we implement their gaze.

150
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,830
Just go through this once to get random password,

151
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,870
that to be the length of eight characters.

152
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,375
If you want to change the length of your password with any number, you can change it.

153
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:18,125
Right? So then now I am going to take it in your random password, length of password.

154
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,255
I'm going to fix it as eight.

155
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:21,350
If you want to change it,

156
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,420
you can write your logic in such a way that

157
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,095
Your length of password can be changed.

158
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,050
Right? Then after that,

159
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,085
what I need valid characters for my password.

160
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:39,520
I am going to directly take a characters that it lean shop that you can also use

161
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,050
some string module and you can create these valid characters for your password.

162
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,180
But for anyway, for simplicity,

163
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,430
but most directly I am taking this.

164
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:55,460
Then nightly I'm using random password.

165
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,460
Check. Now I am going to written thus that password.

166
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,820
So eventually this bird-like enlighten it, right?

167
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,430
I don't want right number of lines, then it's better.

168
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,460
That's it. Now you have a password in your hand.

169
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,010
Then what you need policy year and I mean,

170
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,165
if you whatever the attached whatever policy you want to attach for you or IAM user,

171
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,100
then what is the ER and for that,

172
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:38,140
so I am taking policy AR in equals to let me copy it from your AWS account.

173
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,660
So I guess you have already predefined policies.

174
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,300
I'm going to take that in case if you create your own policy,

175
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,475
you can also create in that way.

176
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:49,995
Right? I'm going to take an existing policy, Erin.

177
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:56,225
So policies, let me take full administration access policy, RN.

178
00:11:56,225 --> 00:12:00,080
So you heard earlier policy OR and here let me copy that.

179
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,660
Otherwise, you can modify your policy around me,

180
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,960
create that and you can assign that to your abuser.

181
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,685
Now what else we need?

182
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,170
We how am User,

183
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,765
password further and policy RN.

184
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:19,205
That's fine. Now let me create an IAM user first.

185
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,030
Right? So I'm going to create an IAM user for that.

186
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,955
I'm going to define a function or monitor of that.

187
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,290
We have a function that if you write,

188
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,785
this is create user.

189
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:35,430
Right?

190
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,910
Now let me, let me create your user base here.

191
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,215
To create your user,

192
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:45,395
I am going to take that Italy B23 method,

193
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:47,525
that is create user.

194
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:53,510
And anyway already we how IN username and I am client, right?

195
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,945
I'm going to get it. I am going to take that one directly.

196
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:59,990
Okay, now see here,

197
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,745
I am client dot create user.

198
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:10,850
So guys here I'm going to take username as what is the username,

199
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,965
your technology, how your username here,

200
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:15,320
let me take this has my user name.

201
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,620
That's a simple thing I created.

202
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,270
Now, if I execute this script,

203
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,445
know because of that you will get that I am user name, right?

204
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:28,160
So after creation of your user,

205
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,020
what is your next step?

206
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:34,160
Actually, you need to create a login profile means you have to provide console access.

207
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,860
So to provide login profile already how a method,

208
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,020
once again, that is simply create login profile, username, password.

209
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,160
Right?

210
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,585
C, I am taking,

211
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:49,520
I am client ID dot create login profiling.

212
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,605
So for lying profile, what do you have to provide?

213
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:56,585
Username equals two.

214
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:01,100
So already we how your user name in this variable.

215
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,360
Let me copy and paste it.

216
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,270
Then what else you need for this method?

217
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,160
Password, right?

218
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,515
We have a random password already.

219
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:18,365
Password equals password, right?

220
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:22,625
Then after that password reset required.

221
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,350
So I don't want to reset it.

222
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,780
Let me I mean, why logging?

223
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,980
I don't want to reset.

224
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,520
I want you this possible only just I am using POP false if you make

225
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,980
it as a true while logging your user,

226
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,575
password, reset it, that's it.

227
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:41,300
So after that you have one more thing,

228
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,145
guys, you need to attach your policy, right?

229
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:46,909
So simply attach policy.

230
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:49,955
So username policy, Aaron, Very simple, light,

231
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:56,300
IAM, client, attached policy.

232
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,520
So simply how to provide username.

233
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,620
Ok, how did you, how username here?

234
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,390
Let me copy it and paste it.

235
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,515
Username.

236
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,180
Then policy here,

237
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,795
and I already told my policy are in,

238
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:23,100
into this policy or n. Let me write it.

239
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,080
That's it.

240
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:36,440
All right. So now to login, right?

241
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,915
To login you need you what?

242
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,760
Iam user name and password.

243
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,650
So password is there in this variable just I want to print this password.

244
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:51,740
Print IAM, user name,

245
00:15:51,740 --> 00:16:01,790
whatever you created and password for that.

246
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,300
So they senior realtime don't display engine of that.

247
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,030
He just tried to store this information into some CSV

248
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,090
file so that you can share that with a particular IAM user.

249
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:21,710
Dot format, your IAM underscore user and a sport name,

250
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,775
then pos, what I have taken this variable.

251
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:28,475
So just I am printing because I need to login, right?

252
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:37,145
That's it. Ok. Fine.

253
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:39,950
Now let me save it and run it.

254
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,470
So if any exceptions occur,

255
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,850
then we'll try to handle them.

256
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,085
Now I'm going to run the script, just see the output,

257
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:55,805
right within this password your new IAM user has been created, right? See that?

258
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:59,910
Let me go ahead and refresh my userspace.

259
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,115
Yes, do with Python it up gmail.com user has been created,

260
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:12,120
right? With administration axis.

261
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:22,150
Right. Now, let me log in into

262
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:32,360
direct. Verify it, right.

263
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:53,690
So what is the password we have assigned for that? Oh, sorry.

264
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,910
Light

265
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,610
management console.

266
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,620
Everything is finite. Okay.

267
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,280
Okay.

268
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,755
I am username.

269
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:30,230
So already we have our AM username.

270
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,935
Then what is the password?

271
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:46,040
Yes, already we have that signing.

272
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,110
Right? Nuts. It are able to

273
00:19:50,110 --> 00:20:00,295
login id how full administration access you can do whatever you want, right?

274
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:02,469
Let me go here.

275
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:07,520
Otherwise, I will go with the services, IAM,

276
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,230
whatever the action you want to do now you can do

277
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,885
because you are given administration access.

278
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:24,820
Let's say guys, right?

279
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,225
You're able to login now with the Euro created profile.

280
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:32,455
Now if I rerun this program just after the what is happening,

281
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:35,290
entity already exists, means already same.

282
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,430
I am usury existing.

283
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,280
That's why you are unable to create our entity.

284
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,610
Right now. How you can handle this? Nothing is that.

285
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:50,860
See. Now before going to create your IAM,

286
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,530
my axis, I am user.

287
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:58,290
Just try with, try and accept and handle with an error. Try.

288
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,470
Fce, excerpt,

289
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:16,170
exception as e.

290
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,940
Right? Nowadays, you know,

291
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,649
already we have seen while getting user details,

292
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:28,415
we handle this exception handling in a simple way in this, using this right.

293
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:34,739
That is, if E dot or response of error,

294
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,930
then code equals two.

295
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,475
So whatever you are getting now,

296
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:44,990
now we're getting right.

297
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,045
Like already, you are entities existing, right?

298
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:58,160
So that is entity already exists.

299
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,870
So if it is already exists,

300
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,375
then I don't want to run this.

301
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:07,295
Then simply print already

302
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:14,705
IAM user width is exist.

303
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:21,390
So that is, whereas I am user, I am username.

304
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,225
Then after that, I went to simply exit from the script.

305
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,355
So sys dot exit.

306
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:34,055
Suppose I am giving this, right.

307
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:38,225
Else. Suppose if we get any unknown error,

308
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,920
just tried to rectify that.

309
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,900
So based on that errors,

310
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,610
you can handle any number of errors.

311
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,695
So as of now, suppose this is my error.

312
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:49,640
I'm going to handle these otherwise, please,

313
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:58,640
of verifying the following error and retry.

314
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,520
So what is the other you're going to handle it,

315
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,865
you are going to get into your E logic.

316
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:07,580
Then again, I want to exit because we got this error.

317
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,605
You are not able to create your user.

318
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:11,630
So I don't want a 100 million script.

319
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,440
That's it.

320
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:19,100
So let me import my sys module as well. That's it.

321
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,470
Now let me save this, right?

322
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,605
I'm going to run your user, see what is happening.

323
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:27,065
That's a great IAM user.

324
00:23:27,065 --> 00:23:30,395
Already a user with the do with python that humor easily exist.

325
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:33,965
That's a okay.

326
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:40,430
So there's, there's a simple way to create an IAM user with login access,

327
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,370
edit list management console, access.

328
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,610
The same way you can try if you want to create

329
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:55,130
an IAM user width programmatic access keys, right?

330
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,290
Or if you want to get an IAM user with

331
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,950
both programmatic access keys as well as console access.

332
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,380
Right? You can do that.

333
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:09,275
In next video, we will see how to create an IAM user with programmatic access keys.

334
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,780
And after that, we will see how to create an IAM user.

335
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,745
Both the axis, I mean programmatic access as well as your console axis.

336
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:17,705
Okay?

337
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:21,510
Okay. Yes. Thank you for watching this video.
