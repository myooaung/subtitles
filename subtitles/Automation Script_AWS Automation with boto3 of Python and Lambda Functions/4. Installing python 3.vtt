00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.785
Friends here our concept is how to install

2
00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:08.865
Python three dot txt and moto three on Windows Server. Let me start that.

3
00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.010
Here we are installing Python 3.1a,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.530
0.4. but you can go with your favorite Python Watson si e to install your Python.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.970
First you have to download it.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.805
So we can download any required Python Watson from

7
00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:25.390
official website called Python.org. Let me open that.

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.680
So here you just to go to downloads,

9
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.370
they are selective or operating system.

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.550
So as of now we are installing or Python on Windows.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.245
Just click on that. See, we are having different types of Python versions here,

12
00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:41.810
but we need Python three dot-dot-dot for.

13
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.370
Just scroll down somewhere,

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.115
you will find your Python three dot-dot-dot for.

15
00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:48.350
So there's the python three dots, m dot four.

16
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.275
And here we are having different types of insulation procedures.

17
00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:53.570
Now I am proceeding with web-based installer.

18
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.505
Very easy one, just click on that,

19
00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:59.430
save the file, and open the file.

20
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.760
Double-click on that and select customize insulation.

21
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.470
Go with the next C.

22
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.155
By default, Python is installing in this location,

23
00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.090
but I don't want to install in that location.

24
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.330
That's why I'm installing with customized option.

25
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.195
Then just, you see,

26
00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:20.480
under C itself just to GW Python some directory name.

27
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.915
So I'll given this Python 37 then installed.

28
00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:27.630
It will take some time and just wait for that.

29
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.099
Once it is installed,

30
00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:37.895
we can verify a Python and pip three,

31
00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:43.055
Washington, I'm in Python and pip machines will just wait further.

32
00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:47.435
As of now, your Python is installing under C in this directory.

33
00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:51.210
So once it is done, yet is almost done.

34
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.910
Just wait, yeah, close it.

35
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.330
Now, under C in this directory,

36
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.410
how your Python, but you can provide any path while installing your python.

37
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.475
That's fine.

38
00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:09.635
No, let me open a command prompt and let me verify Python version.

39
00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:13.880
You are not getting, let me verify p53 as well.

40
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.295
You are not getting right.

41
00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:20.164
See, because once if we install your Python,

42
00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:23.945
you have to a set path for your Python on p3,

43
00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:25.520
on your Windows operating system.

44
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.255
So how to sit in case if you don't set the path,

45
00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:36.245
you how to run always your Python scripts in this way.

46
00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:39.875
C colon, I mean the complete Python interpreter path

47
00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:43.490
c. This is the Python interpreter apart that is there in this location.

48
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.435
That's why in case if you don't add path of

49
00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:50.720
your system paths always you have to run your Python in this way from your command line.

50
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.500
So instead of providing always complete path for your Python,

51
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.870
what we will do is we'll just add these path to

52
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.475
system path so that your system will automatically identify the Python location.

53
00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:04.010
So for that, just to go to this pc and

54
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.875
rightly properties at once System Settings and environmental variables.

55
00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:13.880
So here select a path and edit new,

56
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.105
providing the path for your Python interpreter.

57
00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.230
Semi.

58
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.170
Now, open, close this terminal and then open your command prompt.

59
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.740
And now verify your Python version.

60
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.190
You are getting. Now let me check Python three as well.

61
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.050
Sorry, p53 as well.

62
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.690
It is not working for that also,

63
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.435
you have to add the path C that under Python 37 under Scripts, you how p53.

64
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:47.875
So take this path,

65
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.460
again, go with your properties of this PC.

66
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.370
Once System Settings and environment variables,

67
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.695
path Edit, new, provide the path of your PIP3.

68
00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:01.340
Save it.

69
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.780
So open your command prompt and reopen your command prompt.

70
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.250
Now you can verify your Python and also p53.

71
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.085
Yes.

72
00:04:16.085 --> 00:04:18.200
So once it is done, next,

73
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.275
obese you how to install your boat o3.

74
00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.495
So to install your voter three is simply follow.

75
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.610
Pip3 installed b2, a3.

76
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.140
So simply I am running pip install voodoo three.

77
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.590
Make sure that while running this command,

78
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.645
you should have Internet connectivity.

79
00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:38.060
So PIP3 installed 2.2.3.

80
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.725
That's it.

81
00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:43.760
So actually voter three is not the default model for your python.

82
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.780
That's why we are installing.

83
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.190
So once it is installed,

84
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:56.965
we can verify that by importing in your Python C while installing your moto three,

85
00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:59.665
it is also installing Bhutto core.

86
00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:04.045
Because on the top of this Bhutto Koran lever Buddha U3 is dead.

87
00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:08.350
So in order to install your boat u3 separately,

88
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.380
automatically, we will install while installing bow to three.

89
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.120
That's a so still it is taking sometime, just wait for that.

90
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.035
Yes, it has been installed.

91
00:05:26.035 --> 00:05:28.380
So go to your Python tunnel.

92
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.545
Try to import Bhutto three.

93
00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:34.790
Yes, it is that that's a simple way to install

94
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:41.480
your required Python version and u3 to work with AWS services using Python scripts.

95
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.080
Thank you.
