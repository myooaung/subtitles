Friends here or concept is introduction to Buto three.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.265
C boat U3 is the name of the Python SDK for AWS,

3
00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.300
or simply moto three is the Python module or

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.835
Python library or Python API to work with AWS services using Python scripts.

5
00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:19.170
So using moto three,

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.580
we can directly create,

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.250
update and delete AWS services from

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.080
our Python skates without opening AWS management console through the browser.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.190
And we can execute these Python Bhutto three skips either

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.390
from our local server or using AWS Lambda service.

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.980
So in our course first,

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.150
we'll go with how do you implement and execute Python scripts on our local server.

13
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.315
Then we'll move on with AWS Lambda service.

14
00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:50.915
This bottle tree is built on top of Bordeaux core module.

15
00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:55.280
So what are core is the base module in order to work with moto three.

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.885
See if you want to walk with AWS service using Bhutto three of Python,

17
00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:03.485
then you have to install it. So how to install it?

18
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:05.795
So to install your moto three,

19
00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:07.520
if you're using Python 2.2x,

20
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.935
simply use pip. Install Bhutto three.

21
00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.035
If you're using Python 3.4x,

22
00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:14.990
then go with pip, install Ubuntu three.

23
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.635
So this is all about simply introduction to Buto three.

24
00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:20.460
Thank you.
