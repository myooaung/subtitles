00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
Friends here we are implementing python both risks to list only snapshots based on size.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,455
Now let me open my AWS snapshots,

3
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:12,735
which are under US, West One.

4
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:16,905
So here I have three snapshots if you observe foster two or in LGB,

5
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:19,350
and last one is ten GBs snapshot.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,820
Now my requirement is I want to implement Python Bluetooth or escape to

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,255
list AGB snapshots or to get ten GB snapshots are 30 GB snapshots.

8
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,415
First of all, from our previous video, I'm copying the slip.

9
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:35,930
So the purpose of that script,

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,010
just to list all your snapshots under your Butler region.

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,285
So USUS to one.

12
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:43,115
Yes, we are getting three snapshots,

13
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:44,675
but now I need to filter.

14
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:46,820
I wanted to get only ten GB snapshots.

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,804
I wanted to get only AGB snapshots.

16
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:51,725
Then how we can do it?

17
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:54,560
C, Let me open official documentation.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,445
As of now, we are taken core from resource object.

19
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:03,365
So under-resource, if you go down here somewhere, he how snapshots.

20
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,360
So under snapshots you how submitters,

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,760
calls all and filter in feeder already we used wound ID arguments.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,820
Now if you observe there is one more argument called filters.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,890
Now let me take this concept.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,510
Let me add it.

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,615
Comma arguments equals two.

26
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:23,345
So here I need to apply a filter based on size.

27
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,895
Now let me create that feeder value first.

28
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,620
So filter size.

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,650
So you know, the standard filter is a dictionary which consists of name,

30
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,370
key, and then values t.

31
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,410
Now here, what is the name you can take?

32
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,415
C just to go here in official documentation itself.

33
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:50,075
If you observe there is volume size.

34
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:54,050
Now, let me copy this, just apply here.

35
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,430
So based on, suppose I wanted to get based on AGB.

36
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,780
So you had to write eight that has a string by default that is a GB.

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,670
Now let me save it.

38
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,340
And let me run it and see the output.

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,205
You are getting two snapshots AT 484.

40
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:15,065
If you observe here.

41
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:18,090
Let me expand it.

42
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,530
844 or an eight GB.

43
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,370
Now I want to get ten GB snapshots.

44
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,275
That's it.

45
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,480
So only one snapshot.

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,115
How with the ten GB that snapshot I am fetching using our Python Bordeaux three, skip.

47
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,315
That's it.

48
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:40,620
Okay, thank you.
