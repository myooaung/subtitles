Friends, this video is about what do you need to complete this AWS automation course.

2
00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:08.565
So simply, you should have an AWS account.

3
00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:10.965
And it is great if you have a free particle,

4
00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:13.455
what are the advantages with free Tara code?

5
00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:18.220
Then you should have some basic knowledge on AWS services and also Python.

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.410
So here I am proceeding with Python 3.4x.

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.395
So even if you how Python 2.2x knowledge, it's fine.

8
00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:26.885
You can work with Python theoretic here.

9
00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:30.785
And finally, you should have some basic knowledge on any Python.

10
00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:35.045
Ideally, it may be PyCharm or atm or Sublime Text,

11
00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:38.510
or at least VaR we emitter for command line.

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.060
So these are the minimum requirements you should have before starting this course.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.720
Thank you.
