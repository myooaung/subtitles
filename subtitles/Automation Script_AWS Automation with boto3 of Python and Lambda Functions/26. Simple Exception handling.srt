1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
Friends here our concept is simple Bhutto, three exception handling.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,545
So you basically have two types of errors in your Python scripting.

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:09,060
The first one is syntax errors,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,755
and the second one is runtime errors.

5
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:12,555
First, let me go with syntax errors.

6
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:16,920
Suppose I am trying to import a module called says No,

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,825
let me save it and run it and observe the output.

8
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,595
You are getting a syntax error.

9
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:22,605
So why you are getting the syntax error?

10
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:28,485
Because you are not following the exact syntax to import your module called sys import.

11
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:30,945
So here instead of P, I have taken x.

12
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:33,270
Now let me take it as a t.

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,420
And one more thing. Whenever if you get any syntax error,

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,245
then there is no any special mechanism to handle it.

15
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:42,205
How to rectify it manually.

16
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:45,035
We are rectified that. Now let me save it and done it.

17
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:46,625
Now it's fine.

18
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:50,255
Now let me try to take one more example.

19
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:53,210
Suppose I am trying to print a string called Hello

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,885
using printf function and let me run it and observe the output.

21
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:59,225
Again, you're getting syntax error.

22
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,625
So why you are getting this syntax error?

23
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,210
Print, if you want to print any string using printf function,

24
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,864
you have to write your string inside of quotations.

25
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:09,770
But I have taken only starting quotation.

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,064
I forgot to close into quotations,

27
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:14,135
then rectify it manually.

28
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:16,250
Run it. Now it's fine.

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,350
So this is about the worst syntax errors.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,525
Now let me go with the word runtime errors.

31
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:27,185
Suppose I am trying to import module called B23.

32
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:29,585
See that syntax where it is perfect.

33
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,625
No, I'm running C, the output.

34
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,030
You are getting an error called module Not Found error.

35
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,335
It is not a syntax error.

36
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:37,610
It is a runtime error.

37
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,800
While running, your Python interpreter

38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,400
identified that voter three is not installed on your python.

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,445
That's why it is showing that no module named Bhutto three.

40
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:48,365
Actually I uninstalled Bhutto three.

41
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:50,360
That's why you are unable to,

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,370
your python is unable to find that module.

43
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,455
You are getting an exception while running.

44
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,675
You're getting another while running.

45
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:59,330
Now, whenever if you get any errors,

46
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,310
exceptions while running, you can handle them with the help of a block called Pi.

47
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,915
And except now let me take it C, not only here,

48
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:14,570
whenever if you are trying to import any module which is not a default model,

49
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,165
then try to use you what pi index_set to block.

50
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:18,785
So I'm using try.

51
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:20,705
I'm trying to input o to three.

52
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:28,745
And here I am writing except exception as E. Then let me print your E.

53
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:33,920
What is the error you are going to get c That no module named Bhutto three.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,930
So it is very simple way just to handle lever exceptions.

55
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,390
See, while implementing your Python scripts or Python Bhutto transcripts.

56
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,895
If there is any possibility to get

57
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:50,570
any exception there he just tried to use try and except block.

58
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,350
That's it.

59
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,575
Now, while going forward,

60
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,380
always tried to use try and except the blog while

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,590
importing your boater three or any third party modules.

62
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,380
Now let me install first your Bhutto three.

63
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,335
It has been installed.

64
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,645
Now let me enter into your Python terminal.

65
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm inputting Bhutto three here.

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,720
And let me show you the list of available operations are classes on your Buddha three,

67
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,125
same thing you can get from your official documentation as well.

68
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:25,670
And in this, if you observe somebody how exceptions Class C,

69
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,680
that there is some exceptions.

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,795
Now, let me show you the list of available exceptions from your Bhutto three.

71
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:38,225
So these are the list of available exceptions from your Bhutto three.

72
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:40,835
Then what is the use of these exceptions?

73
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,215
Very simple.

74
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:47,480
In case if you are very good at your exception handling concept from your Python,

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,030
then you can go with the exception.

76
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,330
Otherwise use simple tie and accept to block.

77
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,640
See here, I'm using that.

78
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,375
Suppose while importing your module.

79
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,805
While importing a module,

80
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:05,510
let's say try import B23.

81
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,640
Suppose if moto three is not there,

82
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,120
then there is an exception name for that.

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,705
See that?

84
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,925
Suppose I am trying to import XYZ,

85
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:16,430
just loginData expertise like boat u3.

86
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,110
If that boat u3 modelling is not there,

87
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,770
you are getting an exception called module not found an exception.

88
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,885
That exception directly can paste here,

89
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:28,700
except in case if you get any exception called modal naught phone directly,

90
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,935
you can display your one description.

91
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:35,719
See that voter three is not installed.

92
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:43,530
So please install B23 and try again.

93
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,844
So other than these exceptions in case if you get any exceptions,

94
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:50,255
then in that case,

95
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:53,675
that exception falls under this line, under this block.

96
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:58,160
That's it. So if you're getting confusion with this line, just forget about this.

97
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,850
Just use simple accession block called tri-accept.

98
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,115
Fine.

99
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:08,630
And one more thing. Suppose if you are using Botox remodeling

100
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,905
your entire Python script and you are not having utopian your host,

101
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:16,040
then, then there is no use to use Bhutto three newer code.

102
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,005
That's why I want to stop my Python script.

103
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,450
Then whenever, if you get any exceptions there,

104
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,135
just write sys dot exit, stop us.

105
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:25,340
I don't want to execute the next lines.

106
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,990
So that is a best practice.

107
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,080
That's it. So same way you how

108
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,260
these many number of exceptions in your boat of the suppose

109
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,710
if you are not able to find your exception in this list,

110
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,730
you can also enter into Bordeaux core because both 2-3 is built on

111
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,795
the top of Bordeaux core.

112
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:55,370
That's why here you have Bordeaux core exceptions.

113
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:02,915
Also. See that these are the exceptions from your Bhutto core.

114
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:05,930
Now, instead of using moto three exceptions,

115
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,450
you can also use Bhutto core extractions directly.

116
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,970
See whenever Bordeaux trees installed by default,

117
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,345
Bhutto core module is available with your host.

118
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:17,240
Now, let me show you one more example.

119
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,400
Suppose I am creating my AWS management console using, let's say.

120
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,385
Aws management console are session object, that is your wish.

121
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:31,745
Moto three dot, dot Shen.

122
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:37,010
Then I'm taking Profile Name as let say some dope profile.

123
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,635
Let me save it and done it and observe the output.

124
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:42,815
These not error because syntax right is perfect.

125
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:46,115
But if you observe portico dot exceptions,

126
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:52,505
profile not phone, DO profile actually I don't how dope profile on my configured list.

127
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,355
That's why you are getting this exception.

128
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:58,250
Then if you are able to predict sees generally we

129
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,115
can assume that if del profile is not formed,

130
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:03,530
then are the time definitely Bhutto coordinate expressions on

131
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,930
profile NOT_FOUND exception will occur.

132
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,500
That's why what I'm doing is try.

133
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,035
Just try with this line and then just I am writing one exception.

134
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,345
In case if this exception occurred,

135
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:27,095
then I can say that pre DO profile is not configured on your work,

136
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:33,785
not AWS credentials file.

137
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:44,195
So use other profile or please configure DO profile, that's it.

138
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:47,840
So this is the advantage with exceptions.

139
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,870
If you are able to predict your exception then by using this except your exception,

140
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,549
you can write your wound message.

141
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:58,400
You are wound description, you can print that.

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,290
Say, now after that,

143
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,195
I don't want to exclude HIV profile is not there.

144
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:04,490
How can I get access with my AWS or cone?

145
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,635
That's why I'm stopping my Python script.

146
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:08,180
So instead of taking exit one,

147
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,210
let me take here exit three, different than our exit.

148
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,925
That's it. You can take any error code that is your mission.

149
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:19,130
So other than this, suppose Bordeaux.co.uk self-funded profile not phone up than this.

150
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,785
If you get an exception, then that exception,

151
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:24,035
I want to fall in this block,

152
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:28,145
then just write that's now save it underneath.

153
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:29,940
What happened.

154
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,170
Yeah, Bordeaux core is not defined,

155
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,180
so we need to import that Bhutto core.

156
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,190
So once voter three is there,

157
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,380
by default, protocol is also that.

158
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,730
See that DO profile is not configured on

159
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,350
your database credentials file use other profile or please configure DO profile.

160
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,090
Now let me take S3 dollar per.

161
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,790
So just replace wherever there is there that S3 profile in terms

162
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,025
of replacing this Just to take in terms of variables so that it is very easy.

163
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:06,190
Automatically you can change your profile names.

164
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,240
That's fine.

165
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,120
Now let me save it and now it's perfectly fine if you get any exception,

166
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,020
that related block will execute and it will stop.

167
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,590
So as of now everything is fine because as they fall upon prophase,

168
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,250
they're now using this AWS management console session,

169
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,130
which is created by a $3 per, i want to work with.

170
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,370
I am actually S3 dollar per profile is from S3 dollar per IAM user.

171
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:37,370
And that I am user is having a policy and that policy will allow to work with S3 buckets.

172
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,245
But I'm trying to work with IAM.

173
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,150
Let me see what will happen.

174
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,465
So i am console using resource object.

175
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:46,550
Then from your console,

176
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,010
edit list management consultation object.

177
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,795
Then just use a resource.

178
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:52,655
Then provide your service name.

179
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:54,635
I want to work with IAM.

180
00:09:54,635 --> 00:10:02,405
Then for each user in I am console dot uses not all,

181
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:05,640
just I want to display all users.

182
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,640
See the output. What it is giving.

183
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,830
Again, it is giving an exception.

184
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,215
If you observe simply these access denied.

185
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,120
And if you observe this is Bhutto code erotics,

186
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,370
sexual dot client run.

187
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,680
So simply you are getting access denied because the IAM profile,

188
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,020
which is having a policy to access S3 buckets,

189
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,790
but we are trying to work with IAM.

190
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,560
So that's why you can also create tri-accept

191
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,255
block while creating your required service console are well,

192
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:39,949
getting your required information.

193
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:45,350
See that what I'm doing is trying to do creative work.

194
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,300
Required a service object,

195
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,734
then pi to work on that in case if you get any exception,

196
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:55,310
except exception as just I am trying to print that E.

197
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,570
This is the simple way just to handle you are exceptions.

198
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:08,310
So let me take here some exception as fine and observe the output.

199
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,525
Now, simply are giving this information instead of dark.

200
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:21,275
See that what I'm doing is x in case if you no exception, right?

201
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:25,400
So from Bordeaux core dot exceptions,

202
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,545
dot client Iran, then you are,

203
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:32,420
you can simply in print in this way.

204
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:39,560
So this is a client error exception up the output.

205
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,995
If you get anything other than client error,

206
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,155
then it will exclude this exception blog.

207
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:49,010
And one more thing, whatever the error you are getting here,

208
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,560
exception you are getting that also you can store

209
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,320
in a variable and you can print it that variable on.

210
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,180
So now let me try to print that.

211
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,585
And what about the area you are getting here under the house on list of operations here.

212
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:11,390
See that? So it is,

213
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,135
it will be very helpful after that.

214
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,310
So there is a response on that note.

215
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,810
Let me try to print it on response

216
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:26,945
for what our the error you captured under there is a option called response.

217
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:28,445
That is a dictionary.

218
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:30,590
And in this dictionary there is a heirarchy.

219
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,365
In that era, there is a court that is access denied.

220
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:38,645
So that's why what I am doing is from this response I'm taking,

221
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:41,795
which is very useful for your real time error.

222
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,830
In that error, I have a key called code.

223
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,825
Let me save it and run it and observe the output access denied.

224
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:55,100
So now what I can do is I can take one if condition here.

225
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,885
If you are exceptions, dot response.data dot.

226
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:03,140
I mean, in terms of fatigue et al and code,

227
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,950
if it is equals to access denied.

228
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,510
So you may get a different error here,

229
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,180
error code, if it is access denied than I can say print,

230
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,190
your profile is not authorized to use,

231
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,305
is not having access to

232
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:40,910
walk with IAM user.

233
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,265
Let's say l.

234
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:47,390
L simply I'm printing that entire code,

235
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,740
whatever the code you are going to get,

236
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,020
you make it to some different code asthma.

237
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,730
So simply I'm printing back.

238
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,660
Then I'm stopping simply sys dot exit some error code.

239
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,450
Let's say here phi and here let say six. Save it and run it.

240
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,250
That's your profile is not having access to work with our users.

241
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,040
Now let me take it off S3 dollar per I'm taking

242
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,700
suppose route and replace wherever I say developer is there.

243
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,055
And Annette and observe the output.

244
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,840
Now it's working perfectly.

245
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,825
So in this way you can handle your exceptions for your boat to three.

246
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:27,905
So just simply using with the try and except to block.

247
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:30,860
So while implementing different types of skips,

248
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,660
you'll get different types of exceptions.

249
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,670
Based on that, you can add that exceptions to

250
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,250
your code so that you will make perfect code.

251
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,945
That's okay.

252
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,410
Thank you.
