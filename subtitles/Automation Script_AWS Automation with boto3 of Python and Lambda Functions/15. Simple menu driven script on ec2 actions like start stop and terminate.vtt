00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Friends here we're implementing simple Python Bhutto,

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.845
three menu-driven skip to perform different actions on EC2 instance,

3
00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:14.580
be clear, we are implementing this menu-driven skip to work on one single EC2 instance.

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.330
Now let me open my sublime text editor first.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.835
So I'm going to import moto three.

6
00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:30.970
Let me save it as like Minow driven script on EC2 actions.

7
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.260
Now, first let me create our AWS management console.

8
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.525
So here I'm going to create that using Bhutto 3.What session?

9
00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:47.585
Session, then Profile Name,

10
00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:51.420
I am taking EC2 dollar per.

11
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.510
Then I am creating my EC2 Console.

12
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.530
So I'm going to create my EC2 Console by using both the objects,

13
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.270
I mean client and resource.

14
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.805
I want to show you by using Buddha ways.

15
00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:07.910
So EC2 Console using resource.

16
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.884
So simply AWS management console.

17
00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:16.505
Resource service name is EC2.

18
00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:22.760
Then regime name equals two,

19
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.510
US East One, I'm selecting ten.

20
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.460
Let me create EC2 Console using client object as well.

21
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.535
So instead of resource just declined.

22
00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:42.935
So first we will implement the script menu-driven script using resource first.

23
00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:47.615
So before that, our menu-driven script is something like in this way,

24
00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:49.860
let me show you that.

25
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.905
While to say I'm printing.

26
00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:59.939
This is scraped performs

27
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.030
the following actions on EC2 instance.

28
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.970
Let me provide the different options.

29
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.370
So I'm writing the first option as oppose to start, then second, stop.

30
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.425
Terminate. Let me write the restart.

31
00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:30.900
Yeah, I will take simply terminate.

32
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.815
And let me take four types now simply exit,

33
00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:39.420
exit from your script.

34
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.445
Now, let me read the option.

35
00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:46.670
So after displaying these options and just I want to read them.

36
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:57.510
So I am taking option variable equals to simply in digital input, Enter your option.

37
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.085
So what are the option you won't be until you can enter it.

38
00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:06.200
Now, in case if you're opting out of in the range 1234,

39
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.680
then I want to say your option is not a valid option.

40
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.765
In case if it is option one,

41
00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:13.460
I want to start my EC2 instance.

42
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.510
If it is option two,

43
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.880
I want to stop and then I want to animate.

44
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.575
If option is for, then I want to simply exit.

45
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:24.415
So simply I am taking if it were option equals to one,

46
00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:28.825
then here I want to implement skip just to start over EC2 instance.

47
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:35.185
So I'm displaying starting EC2 instance.

48
00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:40.090
Then in case if your option equals to two,

49
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.560
then just I want to write stopping EC2 instance.

50
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.090
Then if option equals to three,

51
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.875
and then I want to terminate.

52
00:03:56.875 --> 00:04:04.980
So simply terminating EC2 instance.

53
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.620
Then if option equals to four,

54
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.760
then I want to exit from us script,

55
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.025
so simply sys dot exit.

56
00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.720
So we are using cease modelling.

57
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.755
Let me import that module in your script.

58
00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:29.915
That's a incase if option is out of these 1234,

59
00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.305
then I want to say print.

60
00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:37.050
Your option is invalid.

61
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.250
Please try once again.

62
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.040
That's it.

63
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.515
So this is our script.

64
00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:54.860
Let me save it. And I'm opening my command line.

65
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.770
No, let me enter into a Bhutto transcripts.

66
00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.395
So here we have our menu-driven scope.

67
00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:00.365
Let me run it.

68
00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:03.230
See the output I'm entering four, it is exiting.

69
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.925
And mentoring support some two,

70
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:08.900
then it is going stopping EC2 instance once identity showing you what Meno,

71
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.435
then let me enter four, it is exiting.

72
00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:12.920
But before going to start,

73
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.310
stop or restudy How To Know weekends tells you how

74
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.970
to start or which instance you have to restart our stop or terminate.

75
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.610
So let me open our menu-driven scrape.

76
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.290
So in our scrape,

77
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.710
so after reading your option based on what option here,

78
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.565
I'm taking some instance ID equals to simply

79
00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:40.820
input EC2 instance ID.

80
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:50.190
Let me copy this line and I want to paste these in each and every if condition.

81
00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.600
So let me just to avoid indentation errors.

82
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.200
So here also I need to paste it.

83
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.700
So let me write one more line while exiting.

84
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.990
Just I want to say,

85
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:37.100
thank you for using the script.

86
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.315
Now let me save it.

87
00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:47.800
Now let me run four.

88
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.570
Yes, it's working.

89
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.855
It is asking entity where EC2 instance ID.

90
00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:55.820
Let me get one of the EC2 instance ID from my AWS or cone.

91
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.570
So this is my easy to console here how some number of instances,

92
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.135
let me take one of the instance.

93
00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:03.605
So I am taking this one.

94
00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:05.780
So then priority would instance ID.

95
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.530
Then it is displaying starting EC2 instance.

96
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.780
But if you refresh it still,

97
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.540
it is stopped because we don't have any logic to

98
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.885
him to start your EC2 instance inside of our script.

99
00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:20.495
Then how we can implement that logic?

100
00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:23.180
C, if it is option equals to one, you have to start,

101
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.770
but to start your EC2 instance,

102
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.985
you don't have any logic here.

103
00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:27.380
We didn't implement that.

104
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.230
So now we have both the consoles, I mean,

105
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.070
using resource and using client for our EC2 Console.

106
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.980
Then on that particular console,

107
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.455
you need to work with one EC2 instance.

108
00:07:39.455 --> 00:07:43.940
No, let me open your resource documentation of your EC2.

109
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.265
So let me click on EC2 Console.

110
00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.540
I mean you see two surveys.

111
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.930
And first let me go with the resource option.

112
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.660
In resource, we know we have three set of operations.

113
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:03.615
First setup operation is to modify our co-create new ec2 service or your EC2 options,

114
00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:04.985
you never to console.

115
00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.070
Then second is just to work with

116
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.430
the particular ec2 service or volume or tank to work with

117
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.470
one single EC2 instance are to work with

118
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.599
one EC2 volume for that second set of operations,

119
00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:20.705
third set-top operations to collect existing information about

120
00:08:20.705 --> 00:08:24.680
all your EC2 instances or volumes or image ID, right?

121
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.835
Ru Er Qie pays. Now our requirement is to walk with one EC2 instance,

122
00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:31.220
then that option is there in a second list.

123
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.275
See that there is an instance.

124
00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:37.909
So by using this, you can create particularly EC2 instance object.

125
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.590
Now see that first thing.

126
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.095
After taking your instance ID,

127
00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:48.605
you need to create your particular instance object.

128
00:08:48.605 --> 00:08:54.480
Now I'm creating my required instance object,

129
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.810
taking lengthy variable name,

130
00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.625
but you don't need to take this lengthy variable name equals to from your EC2 Console,

131
00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:07.024
EC2 Console using resource object dot simply instance,

132
00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:10.430
just to provide you an instance ID, that's it,

133
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:16.355
so that it will create your required EC2 instance object.

134
00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.890
Now here, just to be created object,

135
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.920
then what are the operations are available on this object?

136
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:30.545
Then we haul BAR operation in your Python right on your object.

137
00:09:30.545 --> 00:09:32.250
See that?

138
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.830
Yeah, sorry.

139
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.075
No, let me save it and run.

140
00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:59.885
What happened? We learned that line.

141
00:09:59.885 --> 00:10:04.205
Yeah, I forgot to close rate. Sorry.

142
00:10:04.205 --> 00:10:08.670
I forgot to close parenthesis.

143
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.670
Now let me run it. Suppose start one.

144
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.860
Then some instance idea I am giving.

145
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.550
All happen.

146
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.330
Why do showing euro, let

147
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.630
me

148
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.175
capitalize.

149
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.840
I have given smartly, sorry.

150
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.200
No, let me run your script.

151
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.965
Suppose start, then I'm giving our instance ID.

152
00:10:44.965 --> 00:10:49.210
Then see that whatever the instance you created,

153
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.210
whatever the instance object you created on the object,

154
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.250
these are the available operations.

155
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.705
So as of now what I need,

156
00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:58.135
I need to start or stop or terminate options.

157
00:10:58.135 --> 00:10:59.260
Go and search here somewhere,

158
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.860
you will get your acquaint option C. There is a stock option.

159
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.300
That means on your created objects simply use dot star so that your instance will

160
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:13.645
start or stop or terminate. That's it.

161
00:11:13.645 --> 00:11:15.730
If you want to reboot it,

162
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.050
yes, you can reboot it.

163
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.405
So you can add one more option, right?

164
00:11:19.405 --> 00:11:26.630
C. So now, simply open your menu-driven skip.

165
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.505
Now you want to start right?

166
00:11:30.505 --> 00:11:35.140
So if you want to start simply whatever the object he

167
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:40.350
has been created for that just add dot.

168
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.670
That is a method, let's say.

169
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:49.715
Now the same way you how to use first stop optional.

170
00:11:49.715 --> 00:11:51.020
So now let me copy

171
00:11:51.020 --> 00:12:00.770
this. Now let me come in.

172
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.329
These are DIR operations.

173
00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:04.820
So once if we do the air operations so that you will get the

174
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.790
available options on your object created object.

175
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:12.830
Now, my request aside my required instance,

176
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:18.635
object dot stop in case if you want to terminate.

177
00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:25.475
So here also you have to create your easy to object first.

178
00:12:25.475 --> 00:12:28.550
Then after that terminating rights simply,

179
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.485
you are my required instance.

180
00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:36.740
Object dot terminate.

181
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.350
That's now let me save it.

182
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.365
I see that I am running.

183
00:12:42.365 --> 00:12:45.110
I want to start some easy to instance.

184
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:49.550
Then let me get my EC2 instance ID.

185
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.310
I'm doing starting EC2 instance.

186
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.880
So it is starting done just to go and refresh so

187
00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.215
that you are going to see change as pending means now it is going to get running status.

188
00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:03.830
So after sometime it will get into running status.

189
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:04.520
That's it.

190
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.685
Now let me terminate one of my EC2 instance.

191
00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:10.295
So let me take last instance.

192
00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:12.350
So this is my intensity.

193
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.965
So let me rerun your already we are on our scripted self-rate.

194
00:13:15.965 --> 00:13:18.530
So let me take option has three No, no.

195
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.040
I want to admit this EC2 instance.

196
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.285
See that, refresh it and see that your lost intensity shutting down.

197
00:13:26.285 --> 00:13:30.155
That's it. So now let me exit from my script.

198
00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:32.240
So be clear on this.

199
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.985
If you want to work with only one particular EC2 instance using resource object,

200
00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:39.320
what you heard, please.

201
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.185
First thing you how to create your instance object.

202
00:13:45.185 --> 00:13:48.890
Where it is, yeah, instance object simply on your console,

203
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.950
there is an operation called instance for that you have to provide

204
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.310
your instance ID so that you are going to create your instance object.

205
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.880
Not only for instance, suppose if you want to work with particular volume,

206
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.295
then dot volume, then volume ID.

207
00:14:01.295 --> 00:14:03.710
If you want to work with one key pair,

208
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.170
then dot you are keeping.

209
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.330
If you want to work with some image ID,

210
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.150
then dot image, then image id,

211
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.650
how to prove it so that you are going to get

212
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:18.290
that particular service object for adoption by using DR. operation,

213
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.095
you will get the list of operations.

214
00:14:21.095 --> 00:14:24.785
Nuts it, right. Fine.

215
00:14:24.785 --> 00:14:27.980
So this is by using resource method,

216
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.890
resource object we are implementing or menu-driven script.

217
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.915
Now let me show you using client.

218
00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:40.130
Now let me open your EC2 client.

219
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:45.950
Then I will show you how to use your required options on your instances.

220
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.335
Let me click on client.

221
00:14:48.335 --> 00:14:53.930
Here, see anywhere claim you are having all the options under one set only.

222
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.730
So just to go down somewhere,

223
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.335
you will find your required operations.

224
00:14:57.335 --> 00:14:59.135
Suppose if you want to reboot,

225
00:14:59.135 --> 00:15:01.100
just to start with the reboot,

226
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.790
some very her reboot instances see here,

227
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.070
and you don't have a separate operations to

228
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.800
work with one single instance are multiple instances.

229
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.800
If you want to work with either single or multiple instances,

230
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.540
you have to select only one option.

231
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.090
Using that only, using that operation,

232
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.095
you can work with either single or multiple incentives are volumes,

233
00:15:21.095 --> 00:15:23.030
or you are hosts.

234
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:27.485
Or your image ids are your key pays, whatever it may be.

235
00:15:27.485 --> 00:15:29.330
Same way, just go down somewhere.

236
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.055
You will get start and stop.

237
00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:33.725
See start instances, stop instances,

238
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.360
let me open start instances.

239
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.450
See that start in stances.

240
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.630
Then there is argument called Instance ID.

241
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.745
So in this instance IDs,

242
00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:49.190
if you have only one single instance in your hand,

243
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.610
just provide that instance in this list as a one value so

244
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.600
that this will execute and will stop or start your EC2 instance.

245
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.240
In case if you have multiple instances in your hand,

246
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.695
then just provide all instances as a list of values in this place,

247
00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:08.465
in place of string, so that it is going to execute on multiple incentives are time.

248
00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:13.400
So this is the advantage with client anymore.

249
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.749
Resource.

250
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:18.200
You have to execute your options on one by one instance.

251
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.030
But whereas in your resource,

252
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.940
in your client, you can able to execute,

253
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.450
you are option either on multiple instances,

254
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.190
are one instance at a time.

255
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:28.910
That's it.

256
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.500
So that is the advantage.

257
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.325
So friends, I am attaching the script.

258
00:16:34.325 --> 00:16:37.970
How to use Klein to method to start and stop

259
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.795
and restart or terminate your EC2 instance are instances.

260
00:16:41.795 --> 00:16:43.940
Just to go through that 30 can understand.

261
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.080
Ok. Thank you.
