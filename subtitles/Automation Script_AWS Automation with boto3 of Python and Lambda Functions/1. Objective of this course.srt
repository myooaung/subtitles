Hi friends, welcome to AWS automation with moto three of Python and lambda functions.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,555
Let me provide the object two of this course before starting it.

3
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:13,365
The objective of this course is to cover the core concepts of

4
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:17,400
moto three and lambda C. Most of the cases in real time,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,665
moto three works along with the lambda.

6
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:24,525
That's the reason we included both moto three and lambda into one single course.

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,359
And this course is designed to understand

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,625
Bhutto three and lambda concepts with realtime scenarios.

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:34,160
We divided this course into two parts to get more clarity

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,625
on moto three and lambda part one,

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:42,440
it is about how to write and execute Python Bhutto three scapes on our local server.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,745
You were local server maybe.

13
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:47,810
Anyways, PO2 is about how to write and

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,400
execute Python boater escapes in lambda with the different triggering methods.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,220
And finally, by the end of this course,

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,965
you will get the knowledge to apply

17
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:02,464
different concepts of Bhutto three and lambda four different AWS services.

18
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,350
Thank you.
