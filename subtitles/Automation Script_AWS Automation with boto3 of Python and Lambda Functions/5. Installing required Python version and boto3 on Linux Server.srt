1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,830
Friends here our concept is how to install Python three,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,125
0.8x and Buto three on Linux server.

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:11,910
So here we are installing Python three dots m dot four on Amazon Linux server.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,385
Same steps you can follow on our HCl and sent to a server as well.

5
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:20,445
Now let me launch a new Amazon Linux server.

6
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:24,990
So just go to lunch and select anyone of the Amazon Linux.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:36,070
I'm launching this Amazon Linux server with very basic steps. Just lunch it.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,350
Just wait for some time to get the status as up and running.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,975
And one important point is by default,

10
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:49,400
you will get one other,

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,725
Python Watson Anwar, any Unix or Linux like operating systems.

12
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:58,115
And don't disturb the existing Python version because

13
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:01,670
you were operating system depends on that default python.

14
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,400
That's why dont disturb that existing Python.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,630
Then how you can install your required Python on what?

16
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,675
Unix or Linux like servers. It's very simple.

17
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:13,740
I will show the steps.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,590
No, let me connect with the server.

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:34,325
Now, just check it. Is there any Python or not?

20
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,365
Yes, there is a Python.

21
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:38,945
Let me check with the Python.

22
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:43,160
I found, I found watch when there is no Python three.

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,955
Let me check with Python three dot seven iPhone, iPhone version.

24
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:49,850
There is no Python three or seven has been now willing to

25
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,015
install our required Python three dots have 1.4c.

26
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,980
So first switching to route.

27
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,590
Now go to a browser just such like

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:11,640
install Python on Rachel seven.

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,050
So just opened the very first link.

30
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,200
So I will provide this link on the goal of this video.

31
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,995
Now, I'm sorry, here,

32
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:23,510
before installing your Python,

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,245
you how to install some dependencies.

34
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:30,480
So just copy and paste the link.

35
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:40,230
Then you can go to any location and just I'm going with this location.

36
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,440
So here, just download you are Python 3.1a, 1.4c.

37
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,340
So once it is, don't know debt we just extracted.

38
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,885
It has been extracted.

39
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:06,545
Now. Go to that.

40
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:17,700
Extracted Python three dots or 1.4c and then configured with enable optimizations.

41
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,960
So let me copy next step.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,805
Make old install.

43
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,370
See, we are also having make install command,

44
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,735
but if you use that,

45
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:33,395
there may be a chance to disturb the existing Python Watson,

46
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:35,285
but if you use may call installed,

47
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:38,970
it will install alternate Python version.

48
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,260
So it will take some time, you have to wait for that.

49
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,055
So once it is done,

50
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:51,180
then we will see you are Python three version and p3 Washington.

51
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,415
I'm pausing the video.

52
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:11,690
Once it is done, then I will show you what it is about two completely installation steps.

53
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,040
So it has been installed, you are required Python and also,

54
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,510
let me remove this node.

55
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,915
Fine. Now, go to see first, let me check it.

56
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:44,810
Python hyphen, hyphen version.

57
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,395
So we default to dot, dot 16.

58
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,585
We are not disturbing that. No, let me check it.

59
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:55,295
Python 3.What seven hyphen hyphen Washington.

60
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:58,625
We installed, but you are unable to get the watchman.

61
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,610
See by default, you are,

62
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,725
Python is installed under user local bin.

63
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:09,590
Just go to there and list.

64
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,815
So just now we installed this Python 3.1a and you are PIP3.

65
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:24,620
Right now let me run the industry dot slash python three 0.7. hyphen, hyphen version.

66
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,170
Yes, you are having then dot slash.

67
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,540
Let me check with 3.What seven hyphen, hyphen Washington.

68
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,680
Yes, we have. Now to get easily,

69
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,010
you are Python three and Python pip three,

70
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,560
just I'm creating a soft links under slash bin location.

71
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,100
So just create softening Eleni for less.

72
00:06:50,110 --> 00:07:00,275
Let me take complete path user local bin.

73
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:06,320
In this we how? Python three dot seven.

74
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,680
So that's I'm going to create a soft drink as Python three.

75
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,840
I am renaming it as Python three is simply.

76
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,430
Now just check with Python three, hyphen, hyphen version.

77
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,850
You are able to get it, you are required Python version.

78
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,750
The same way.

79
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,520
Let me create soft link for P53 as well.

80
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,655
So PIP3, 0.7c, I'm creating under been Location slash bin location.

81
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,795
Now check it. Pip3, hyphen, hyphen Washington.

82
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:46,160
Let's say. Fine. Now let me enter into Python three terminal.

83
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,980
Say simply if you type Python on your Unix-like systems,

84
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,215
you will enter into your default Python version.

85
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:54,230
But I need my Python three.

86
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,705
You then type Python three, then enter.

87
00:07:56,705 --> 00:08:00,240
Now here try to import the Buddha three.

88
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,420
Yeah, three is not there because we know that boat or there is

89
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,705
not the default model for your Python, we need to install it.

90
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,370
Now let me install it.

91
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,850
P53. Use p53 if you use simply,

92
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,305
it will install your boat O3 in Python to dot-dot-dot 16, I mean,

93
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:20,750
in the default Python of your waves,

94
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,590
but we need to install moto three under Python three,

95
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,645
That's why use p53, p63.

96
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:29,075
Install Bhutto three.

97
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:33,605
Just I am giving hyphen y for confirmation.

98
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:38,240
Sorry. I found ways for young, right?

99
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,310
So his P3 just run,

100
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,415
p53, are installed voter three, it has been instrument.

101
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,080
Let me enter into Python three.

102
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,040
Then here tried to import b2,

103
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,490
a3 so that we can verify. Yes, It Is there.

104
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,695
No. Let me show you one more thing.

105
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,675
Let me enter into Python two.

106
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:59,255
And if I tried to import here moto three,

107
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:03,965
there is no border that is because we install moto three for Python three.

108
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:10,700
This is the simple way to install your required Python on your Linux servers.

109
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,510
Thank you.
