00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
So here we are in the AWS management console and we

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.405
want to start working with our S3 service.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:18.215
So we are going to go into go under storage into S3.

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:19.460
Okay.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.960
So we're now moving away from EC2.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.210
We did explore EFS, right?

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.989
But EFS was a file storage system,

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:36.215
as there is an object storage system and just unstructured raw data.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.465
It's just much simpler.

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:44.480
No need to integrate anything or to any of the things we had to do for AFS.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.850
So let's just go to S3.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.620
Now.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.760
Every object in Amazon S3 is stored in a bucket.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.680
Before you can store data.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.830
In Amazon S3, you must create a bucket.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.040
So conveniently, we learned in the buckets page, okay?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.000
And you can see there are a number of ways to access creating a bucket.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.260
We can create a bucket from here,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.435
we can create a bucket by clicking this.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:14.480
Since we have 0 bucket right now.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.285
Now, you're not charged for creating a bucket.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.440
Okay?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.100
You are charged for storing objects in

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.580
the bucket and for transferring objects in and out of buckets, right?

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.510
And the charges incur won't be that much.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.800
You're following along with me.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.635
It should be free if you're using the free tier.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.845
And even if you're not to be less than a dollar,

00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:38.450
so no worries there.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.850
So let's create a bucket.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.165
Let's click the orange Create Bucket button.

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:52.820
And first thing we have to do is we have to specify a bucket name.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.290
Okay?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.045
And it has to be DNS compliant, right?

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:04.370
Remember, we said that it has to be unique across all of ours on S3.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.930
So not just on your account,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.285
it has to be unique across all the accounts on Amazon S3,

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:13.675
it should be between 363 characters long.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.255
It shouldn't contain any uppercase letters.

00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:20.335
It should start with either a lowercase letter or a number, okay?

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:22.030
And after you create the bucket,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.680
you can't change its name.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.990
So let's call this number.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.790
Number 1, 8 of this course.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.100
And let's hope that that's not taken.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.705
Okay, well, we'll see when we're trying to create a bucket.

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:51.985
In particular, not now.

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:55.720
Avoid including sensitive information in

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.030
your bucket names such as account numbers and that kind of stuff.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.240
Because the bucket name is visit will be visible in

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.080
the URL or the URLs that point to the objects in the bucket.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.405
Okay, so keep that in mind.

00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:12.025
Now, we have to choose an,

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.565
a diverse region where you want your bucket to reside.

00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:22.585
I'm just going to keep it with the default region that I'm in, US East 2.

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:26.200
Now, you should choose a region that is closer,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.310
close to you geographically to minimize latency

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.200
and costs and to address regulatory requirements.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.920
Objects stored in a region never leave

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.235
that region unless you explicitly transfer that to another region.

00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:41.225
Okay?

00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:44.075
Now, as we scroll down,

00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:45.740
we see this section,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.250
bucket settings for block public access will just gonna keep these at the default.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.205
By default will block all access.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:04:00.140
It's recommended that you keep this enabled for

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.195
security purposes and only when he wanted to expose an object or bucket.

00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:09.290
Would you then go in and update that that setting?

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.740
Now we're going to talk about bucket versioning in another video.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.580
And you can add tags and encryption will also be another video.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.685
So let's go ahead and create our bucket.

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:24.890
Now, as you can see, we've successfully created a bucket number 1,

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.250
8 of this course to upload files and

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.180
folders are the configure additional bucket settings, choose View Details.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.395
So we don't really care about these notifications at the moment.

00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:38.750
Here we have our bucket in our,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.010
in this particular region.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.220
Now, again, keep in mind that amazon S3 is a global service.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.205
As three as a service is global.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:54.230
However, buckets are region-specific, okay?

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.565
And we can conveniently see that the access,

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:01.385
so we know that this is now public.

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:05.930
And now it's time to add an object to our bucket.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.125
So after creating a bucket in Amazon S3,

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:11.870
we're ready to upload an object to the bucket.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.570
And object can be any kind of file,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.700
your text file, a photo,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.895
a video in et cetera.

00:05:19.895 --> 00:05:21.290
And how are we going to do that?

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.595
Is, we're going to click on our bucket.

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:28.820
Now we're in the bucket in Amazon S3.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.895
We are in the bucket called number 1, AWS course, okay?

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:41.435
And here we have two different ways of uploading object to this bucket.

00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:44.600
Now, we can also create a folder.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.315
Now keep in mind that there are no such things as folders in S3.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:56.750
So basically the slashes that you include in your bucket names or

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:04.400
the keys will be used by Amazon to kind of give the impression that you're using folders.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.940
But there is no file system or file structure in S3.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.425
So keep that in mind.

00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:12.950
Okay, So let's click on Upload.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.350
And here we can either add files or we can add a folder.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.360
Again. Adding folder is just going to prefix the name of that,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.820
those files with the name of the folder.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.440
So it's just going to be a longer name with a slash in the middle somewhere.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.755
So let us add files.

00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:37.620
We have burger.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.825
Let's add poppy as well.

00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:47.240
There we go. Files and folders to total, et cetera.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.025
We're not worried about versioning.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:51.155
Let's upload.

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:53.810
Now it's uploading and there we go.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.885
We now have these two objects.

00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:00.490
Within our bucket.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.240
And we can go to our bucket.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.095
And here we go, right, we can see them.

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.600
Now if you click on one,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.500
you can view the details for that bucket.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.550
So in our case, we already know that it's an image,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.160
JPEG, it's size, et cetera.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.195
But what's interesting for us here is the object URL.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.220
And this is just like how we saw on the slides.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.290
We have the name of the bucket.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.830
So number 1, 8 of this course.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.155
And then we have the region US dash,

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:39.490
dash T2, and then we have the name of the object.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.410
Okay?

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.070
So this is the object URL.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.030
This is how you would expose your bucket or your object to,

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.010
to the world or how you would share any objects you have in S3.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.190
Now, if we click on this,

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.360
you'll see that it's access denied.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.890
And the reason for that is because if you recall,

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:10.760
we had blocked all access to this object.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.620
If we go into permissions,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.335
we can see that we,

00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:20.870
as the owner, the account we have read and write access,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.950
but everyone else has no access.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.685
Okay?

00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:30.860
So this is blocked off to the public by default and we're

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:36.830
using the public object URL here.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.000
So it's quite naturally not going to

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.215
work because that's how anybody else would access the object.

00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:50.465
Now, you might ask,

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:53.270
in that case, how do we view our own objects, right?

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.350
We just uploaded something,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.870
we can't do it because it's blocked off with the public.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.880
Do we have to unblock it and have everybody be able to see it for associate ourselves?

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.905
No, if we go to object actions,

00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:06.665
we can click on open here.

00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:09.319
And this will use another URL.

00:09:09.319 --> 00:09:15.515
And this URL will have like an encrypted set of credentials in your account.

00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:19.685
You know, some sort of signature

00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:24.740
notifying AWS that it is you from your account that is viewing this image.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.020
So you're, you're basically viewing from within your account.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.400
And so now you can see the object, right?

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.200
But this will be temporary.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.460
You can't really share this,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.125
reuse this with other people.

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:39.065
It's just for you to see your object,

00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:43.640
whereas this is the official link or the official address to the object.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.190
If you do want to share with people after you have

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.165
allowed access or permissions for to be viewed.

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:53.840
So we can go back into number 1,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.440
8 of this course, and we can do the same thing with Puppy.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.485
Object actions open.

00:10:00.485 --> 00:10:02.525
And there we go, we see the puppy.

00:10:02.525 --> 00:10:10.895
And we can also click on the object directly and from actions open like so.

00:10:10.895 --> 00:10:12.635
Now if you want to,

00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:16.130
you can download your

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.505
Object as well. So if you click down on here,

00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:22.670
it's going to download as Berger dot JPEG.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.200
And we can download as something else as well,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.525
and so on and so forth.

00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:35.060
Now, we can go back in here and we can create a folder, okay?

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.385
This is how you create a folder.

00:10:37.385 --> 00:10:42.725
You can write it like images.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:46.220
And we create the folder.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.635
Now, S3 will make it seem like you have a folder here, right?

00:10:51.635 --> 00:10:54.875
And there's a folder icon and there's no extension.

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:56.585
It engineer slash, click it,

00:10:56.585 --> 00:11:02.960
and you enter into a quasar folder in which you can upload more images.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.955
But keep in mind again,

00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:06.110
there are no folders.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:11.720
It's just Amazon is making it easy for you to manage your object names.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.295
When it sees a slash,

00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:16.370
it's interpreting that as a quasar folder,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.420
but it's not really a folder.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.980
Okay? So we can copy objects that

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.750
we already have in our S3 bucket into a quote unquote folder.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.890
Okay, so let's copy from the burger.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.554
So let's click it. And then we copy.

00:11:35.554 --> 00:11:38.315
And we can select a button.

00:11:38.315 --> 00:11:43.145
We can select a bucket to copy this image object into.

00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:45.680
But if we don't have to memorize,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.810
the names are buckets every time.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.720
So we can just click, Browse as three.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.510
And we click on this here.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.745
Create destination.

00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:57.620
And as you can see,

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.150
the destination is essentially the bucket name,

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.040
followed by a slash,

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.775
followed by the name of the folder followed by a slash.

00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:13.505
Okay, that is the destination of where we're trying to cover this image two.

00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:16.895
And then when we click Copy,

00:12:16.895 --> 00:12:21.975
we can go back into buckets.

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:27.235
I'm number one, Amazon numerator reverse course.

00:12:27.235 --> 00:12:29.410
And then go into your images.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.930
And there we go, we have our copied object here.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.910
Now, like I said,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.470
you're not charged for creating buckets,

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.535
but you are charged for the storage of the objects within the bucket.

00:12:42.535 --> 00:12:44.695
So before we end here,

00:12:44.695 --> 00:12:50.740
let's go ahead and see how we can delete objects and buckets.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.650
So if you just click on an object and you click Delete,

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.100
you have to type in permanently,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.034
delete and you delete your object.

00:13:02.034 --> 00:13:09.710
We go back into number LMS course.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.555
Let's just select all of them.

00:13:11.555 --> 00:13:18.900
Delete, permanently, delete.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:27.740
And there we go. We've deleted all our objects and all our objects.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.085
Now we can delete our bucket, just click on it.

00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:33.830
And now I have to type in the name of

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:39.485
the bucket to so we can confirm we intend to do this.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.215
We could have deleted it without deleting objects as well,

00:13:42.215 --> 00:13:44.630
but it's generally good practice to do your objects

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.840
first so you can see what you're deleting and,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.310
and not making mistakes.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.130
So, you know, that's, that's it.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:57.110
There's just some hands-on with some S3 buckets and objects, how to create them.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.260
You know, it's very easy to play around with them,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.460
download them, copy them,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:07.295
you can move them, and even create more buckets in other regions, so on and so forth.

00:14:07.295 --> 00:14:09.890
So in the next videos we are going to be covering

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.940
versioning and encryption on the security and that kind of stuff.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.570
But basically, in terms of practical use,

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:22.770
this is all you need to know for Amazon S3. Thanks for y.
