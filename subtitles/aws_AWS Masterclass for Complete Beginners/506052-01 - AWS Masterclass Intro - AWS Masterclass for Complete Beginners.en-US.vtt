00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
Welcome to the Amazon AWS masterclass for complete beginners.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.825
This course is for complete beginners and even those that have some experience already.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:12.900
And regardless of, if you have no experience,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.070
little bit of experience,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.675
maybe a little bit more advanced,

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:20.670
you're still going to learn a lot of the foundational fundamentals that are going to help

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.680
you become more experienced with AWS and be able to teach you some different tips,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.245
techniques and strategies that you're going to be able to use in your AWS career.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:32.460
By the end of this course,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.160
you should have a fundamental understanding of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.955
the AWS platform and AWS Certified Solutions architect program.

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:43.220
So this course is really going to give you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.960
that understanding at a foundational level as far as how to navigate to

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.660
the AWS platform easily and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.610
effectively so that you can get the outcomes that you're looking for with AWS.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.640
So let's go ahead and jump into the content that we're going

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.730
to cover in this AWS masterclass.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.080
So we're going to cover five different sections in this AWS masterclass,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.500
with the section number one being the AWS intro plus the identity and access management.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.840
This is where you're going to get an overview of how the AWS Amazon platform works,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.475
how to set up some users,

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:21.695
had a setup, some access management,

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:26.270
and how to create various roles within the AWS ecosystem.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.815
And then in section two,

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:31.520
we're going to go over the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.450
So we're going to go into an introduction into EC2 and we're

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.380
going to go into the hands-on version of the EC2 lesson.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.415
And then we're going to go into installing Git, Docker Apache,

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:45.680
setting up different security groups,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.800
setting up various IP addresses and many more.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.610
And then a section 3, we're going to go over the EC2 storage.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.819
So this is where we're going to go into amazon EBS volumes and volumes hands-on.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.370
We're going to go into creating snapshots,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.910
and we're going to go into encryption Lifecycle Manager.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.400
So that's what we're really going to go into deep EC2 storage coverage.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.890
And then in section 4, this is what we're going to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.280
cover Amazon AWS, simple storage service.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.145
So this is the Amazon S3 and we're going to go into an introduction to Amazon S3.

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:26.225
We're going to go into the hands-on with S3 buckets and objects.

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:29.270
We're going to go into versioning, encryption,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.910
creating security and bucket policies,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.240
and then the S3 websites and several more or less thans.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.310
And then finally in Section 5,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.050
this is what we're going to go into the introduction to the AWS command line.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.030
So this is the CLI.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.140
And what we're going over here is installing the AWS CLI.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.330
We're going to go over configuring it.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.765
We're going to go over the configuration roles and policies.

00:02:53.765 --> 00:03:01.610
And then we're gonna go over the AWS CLI with Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 and then the IAM.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.635
So we're going to go over a ton of different lessons in this particular masterclass.

00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:10.770
And so I'm excited for you to get started and we'll see you on the inside.
