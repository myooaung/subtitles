00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
Hello and welcome to Amazon EC2 storage.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.480
We have just completed our section on

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.175
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or Amazon EC2 for short.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:19.815
In this section we're going to be focusing on just the storage.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:21.509
When it comes to EC2,

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.095
the different options that are available and within those options,

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.905
the different configurations, so on and so forth.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:33.030
Now, as is common with AWS and all their services,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.750
they provide you with complete control and complete access

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.975
to all the different options you might ever need for n type of use case.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:43.400
So it's up to you as

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.840
a solutions architect to become familiar with these different options in

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.260
order to properly assess which are applicable in your given context,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.580
for your given company or you're given project or whatever may be.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.520
So let's start off Amazon EC2 with Amazon EBS,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.265
which stands for Elastic Block Store.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:14.315
So this will be the most common attachable storage you might use for EC2.

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:18.440
And it's a standard one is the one that the instances that we've been

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.580
creating so far have been coming in default width.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.705
So there is something called an instance store.

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:29.585
With some instances will come with by default.

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:32.825
And they're ephemeral storage devices,

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.430
then I'd even devices.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.030
But in our case we've been using the micro,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.165
the Percival instances, write a t instances.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.610
And those come with,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.590
by default with a root volume that is actually an EBS volumes.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.240
So what is EBS?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.910
Let's learn a little bit more about AVS.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.900
Ebs provides block-level storage volumes for use with an EC2 instances.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.880
So the key terms here are their block level and their storage volumes.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.829
And they behave like raw, unformatted block devices.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.304
So once they are attached,

00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:14.930
you have complete control over what to do with them,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.730
in which way you want to format them,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.485
whatever the case may be.

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:22.775
They're just run formatted block storage devices.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:27.530
And you can mount these volumes as devices to your instances.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.015
And the advantage of these volumes is that they are exposed a storage volumes,

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:39.230
but they persist independently of your instance.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.520
So, you know, just like imagine with the Elastic IP,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.510
we could have either starved or even terminate an instance and start a new one.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.360
But we can still attach the same IP,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.610
the elastic IP address to the instance.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.325
So it's independent, it persist independently of the instance itself,

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:00.455
which was a huge advantage, right?

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.730
In the case of failures and that kind of stuff to be easily able to

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.455
switch them up as the same thing with the ENI is the elastic network interfaces.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:12.740
So that's what the term elastic essentially means.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.210
So that's why these are called Elastic Block Store volumes because.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.775
There are elastic, they're independent of the instance.

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:25.430
Any information you store on it will be independent from the life of the instance itself.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.090
And since they are Ron format

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.690
a block devices right room there, block-level storage volumes.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.350
You can create a file system on top of these volumes,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.180
or you can use them in any way.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.540
You'd use a block device, such as a hard drive.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.000
And you can also dynamically change the configuration of volume attached to a device.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.060
So this is a huge plus, right?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.205
You can dynamically change,

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:59.255
are you can do all that dynamically while the EBS volume is attached and being used.

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:01.100
Now, I'm want to give you

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.150
a little more information on AVS because it's such an important topic.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.760
It's recommended for data that must be quickly

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.490
accessible and requires long-term persistence.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.560
So those are the two key terms,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.774
quickly accessible.

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:15.815
Long-term persistence.

00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:18.335
Quickly accessible in the sense that it's,

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:23.975
it'll be attached directly to your instance So it as quick as you can get, right?

00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:28.505
Whereas with S3 or if you have an RDS instance setup or something like that,

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:30.665
you know, it's going to be located somewhere else.

00:04:30.665 --> 00:04:34.160
And obviously there will be some latency, so on and so forth.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.280
So the fastest accessible storage device that you can set up for your EC2 instance,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.565
you will potentially be an EBS volume.

00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:46.670
And for long-term persistence, again,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.530
in instances themselves, they might be temporary,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.530
you know, that they might shut down, they might reboot.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.640
You might stop them,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.990
terminate them wherever you plan on doing with them.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.695
Any storage that comes,

00:05:03.695 --> 00:05:06.005
pre-allocate it with the instance.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:10.175
You have something like an instance store is not persistent,

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:13.700
it won't stay with the instance forever and you

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.525
might lose it depending on the actions you take with it.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:23.840
And so this is why AVS is also a huge advantage for data persistence.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.890
Now, it's particularly well suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, um,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.845
or databases, or for any applications requiring

00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:39.440
fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted block-level storage.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.160
So again, there are a lot of use cases here in this course is

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.910
not meant to cover all possible use cases.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.230
But those of you in your different domains will know

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.850
which of these will be best for your use case, right?

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.890
Whatever you need, you're able to do it.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.450
You just need to know the options,

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.165
which I'll show you in this course.

00:06:02.165 --> 00:06:06.230
Now, it is well suited for database applications,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.275
um, that rely on random reads and writes.

00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:15.275
And for throughput intensive applications that perform long continuous reads and writes.

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:19.280
So again, this will depend on your volume type,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.485
which we'll cover shortly.

00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:24.050
And basically with Amazon EBS,

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.299
you pay only for what you use.

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:30.334
The advantage of having a Cloud service,

00:06:30.334 --> 00:06:32.180
you just pay for what you use.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.830
That's it, though.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.190
It's very much like an EC2 instance in that regard.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.620
And you don't have to pay for a whole hard drive if you're not using it,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.540
you're just paying for what you're using from it.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.060
And this is a huge advantage, huge advantage.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.185
Now, here are some features of Amazon EBS.

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:57.170
So EBS volumes are created in

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.350
a specific availability zone and it can then

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.530
be attached to any instances in that same availability zone.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.495
So this means that you can create your EBS volumes.

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:11.345
So essentially your storage, right?

00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:14.570
Storage devices independently of any instances.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.130
And you do not.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.900
This will increase the resilience and the availability and the robustness,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.735
et cetera, your applications and infrastructure.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:27.395
Because you will not be dependent on an instance,

00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:32.435
either to be running or to survive or, or whatever.

00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:34.235
When it comes to your storage,

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:35.780
you'll have an EBS volume,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.675
you'll have whatever you need on that EBS volume and

00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:41.990
as needed you can attach it to any instance you want.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.030
And even in some, you know,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.709
if you meet some criteria,

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:49.175
if you're using specific EBS volume, et cetera.

00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:54.560
You might even be able to use a feature or a service of AWS that

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.545
allows you to connect multiple volumes are the same all into multiple devices,

00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:02.270
which we won't be covering in this video,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.380
but that's also possible.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:11.495
Amazon EBS provides for essentially four different main volume types, though.

00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:15.080
There are other ones like unmagnetized type and so on, so forth.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.825
But these are the four that you really need to know.

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:21.455
And we're going to be covering them in depth in the following video.

00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:24.200
There are general purpose SSD,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.570
which is, which will be the most common one,

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.780
and provisioned IOPS, SSD, by the way,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.355
I AP stands for input, output per second.

00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:37.490
So how many input outputs per second there are?

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.535
And then throughput Optimized HDD,

00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:43.985
HDD, and cold HDD.

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:45.830
So we're gonna be covering these in depth.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.640
And you will need to know what are the advantages of

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.825
each and the disadvantages of each and each has their own purposes,

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.070
their own use case.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:01.280
And it's very likely that you will see questions from these on the exam.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.209
It's very typical AWS question.

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:07.414
Give you a problem.

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:10.580
And they'll ask you which one of these would be the best

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.405
for that particular problem or that particular use case.

00:09:14.405 --> 00:09:18.755
You can create your EBS volumes as encrypted volumes.

00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:20.915
And this will help you meet.

00:09:20.915 --> 00:09:23.585
If you have certain companies,

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:28.380
they have very stringent strict encryption requirements.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.820
Now for data regulation or auditing or wherever that may

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.980
be and you're able to meet those criteria.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.920
Again, we won't be going into too much depth.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.660
We will cover encryption,

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.975
but when it comes to different encryption,

00:09:40.975 --> 00:09:44.740
the encryption protocols and so on and

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.370
so forth that exist and compliance with them and so on so forth.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.195
That's going to be up to you if your company needs it for you to research further.

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:55.030
But it is possible you can

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.260
increment volumes and when you create snapshots, they're automatically encrypted.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.650
And so there's definitely a possibility

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.100
for high security if needed by default early, pretty secure.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.740
But there's a whole way of encrypting them that we'll cover as well.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.290
And you can create a point in time snapshot EBS volumes,

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.065
and these will be stored in S3.

00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:20.630
So you will be charged for using S3,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.255
but it'll be the minimum charge of S3.

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:24.890
S3 is pretty cheap.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.329
And you can really manage how you want the snapshots to be created.

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:32.570
And the snapshots are by default encrypted.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.680
And you can also use this method to transfer

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.440
your EBS volumes or to copy

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.235
EBS volumes to different availability zones or different regions.

00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:47.525
And through snapshots because you can create an EBS volume from a snapshot,

00:10:47.525 --> 00:10:50.030
which will essentially create an exact replica,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.735
exact copy of your EBS volume.

00:10:53.735 --> 00:10:59.720
And you can also view different performance metrics,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.520
such as the bandwidth, throughput,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.445
latency, average queue length, et cetera,

00:11:04.445 --> 00:11:09.620
as you would view any other health performance or whatever for an EC2 instance.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.045
So you can very closely monitor the metrics if needed.

00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:16.460
Now, that's, that's it for this video.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.960
This is just meant to be an introduction.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.700
Tbs EBS will be accessed through the EC2 service,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.785
so it's not a service on its own.

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:29.300
You have to click into EC2 and it's going to be located on the sidebar.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.445
Let me just show you very quickly.

00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:34.100
So here we are in the console.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:40.010
We are located in Ireland for some reason that's going to US, East Ohio.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.790
Remember EC2 is regions specific.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.565
So let's go into EC2.

00:11:46.565 --> 00:11:48.695
And here on the right,

00:11:48.695 --> 00:11:53.255
we've covered instances, instance types, spot instances.

00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:59.570
We've covered AMIs, we've covered security groups of asic I P is placement groups,

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.385
key pairs, network interfaces.

00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:05.840
We'll be covering load balancing and auto-scaling later on in the course.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.440
But here under Elastic Block Store EBS.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.725
So this is where we will be dealing with EBS.

00:12:12.725 --> 00:12:14.930
In the next video, I will be going over volumes,

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:20.060
different volume types, and how to compare them like the ones I showed you.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.620
The the general purpose SSD provision, IOPS,

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:31.400
SSD throughput Optimized HDD and the cold HDD will be located within volumes.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.425
And these are all recommended are snapshots.

00:12:33.425 --> 00:12:37.970
And we actually have a Lifecycle Manager for EBS volumes,

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.895
which we will also cover in a separate video.

00:12:40.895 --> 00:12:44.465
So again, this will just meant to be a quick introduction.

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:48.530
I will see you in the next videos for some more theory and hands-on.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.370
Thanks, buh-bye.
