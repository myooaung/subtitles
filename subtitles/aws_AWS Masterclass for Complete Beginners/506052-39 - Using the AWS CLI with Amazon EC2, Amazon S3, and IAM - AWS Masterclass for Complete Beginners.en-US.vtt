00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.690
Okay, Now that we have basically figured out everything new configuration,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.095
we now have complete control over AWS CLI,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:15.405
and over all AWS services and their public APIs.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:17.970
So what can we do with this?

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.565
Basically anything we want, we can do,

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:26.820
everything we can that we could do in AWS console, the web console,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.660
plus more because sometimes essentially the idea

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.705
was we're also utilizes the APIs in the backend,

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:38.540
call, the services, and not all.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.510
The functionality is always present in the web console.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.950
But with the CLI,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.650
you have complete access to the whole all the,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.120
all the features of all the API.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.500
So you actually have more control than you would on the web console,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.260
even though the web console keeps getting

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.590
improved and more and more options are added with every passing day,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.010
but it will never reach full capacity of what you can do with on the AWS CLI.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.860
So in this video,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.570
since this section is really intended to be a deep dive into

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.750
AWS CLI in terms of development and how to

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.660
utilize it to for automation, that kind of stuff.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.035
It's just meant more so that you can configure it and get

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:28.565
some exposure to it so that as we're learning throughout the rest of the course,

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:29.705
all the different services.

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:32.450
You can also start experimenting with how

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.935
to basically use those services through the CLI on your own.

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:38.960
Some minor guidance from me.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.720
So that's why in this video I'm just going to be

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.020
touching briefly on and just some things you can do.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.975
And we're not going to be doing anything too complicated.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:52.880
I'm just pretty much stuff that we've done in the previous sections.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.320
Using the web console for now,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.995
we're going to be doing it through the terminal instead.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:05.375
So let's start off with some very minor EC2 access.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:09.260
So we can, first of all, we can list.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.910
So just let's us see that we have here

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.344
the CLI installed and then let's see that we have it configured.

00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:22.535
Yep, we have a configured.

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:28.040
And let's first interact with the EC2 service, right?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.925
So we can access it like this.

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:38.945
It was ec2 and we can use it describe instances command.

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:49.025
Now, if you want to view like all the possible commands of a certain service on AWS CLI.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:53.195
There is some very thorough documentation here.

00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:56.780
And in the AWS CLI command reference docs that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.730
AWS dot amazon.com slash CLI slice latest slash reference slash EC2.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.640
And basically if you replaced the EC2 with IAM,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.590
you get the I am reference.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.290
If you replace it with S3, you get as the reference.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.215
So this will list out for you.

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:16.745
All the different possible commands that you can

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:21.200
basically access or use with EC2 from the AWS CLI.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.075
So if you click on any one of them,

00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:26.195
you get a very detailed page.

00:03:26.195 --> 00:03:28.865
Like a man page showing you

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:32.570
all the different options and maybe some examples and so on and so forth.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.490
Okay, So this is very useful.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.760
Definitely use this to sadistic all you need

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.974
to really know if you know how to use a particular service on AWS.

00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:45.320
And you want to learn how to use it in the AWS CLI,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.020
you just come into here and just look up the different functions.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.575
Okay?

00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:50.300
So this is for EC2,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.050
this is four, and this is for S3.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.675
So let's go ahead and run this.

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:02.260
If you remember, I had invalidated

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.620
my security credentials just so you guys will end up using it.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.840
And that's why we no longer have access

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.650
to our account because our credentials don't work.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.185
So let me go ahead and refresh this credentials.

00:04:14.185 --> 00:04:18.160
We have our AWS reconfigured.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.675
So now that we have our AWS CLI configured again,

00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:31.375
we can go ahead and retry the AWS EC2, describe instances.

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:40.040
And we get this huge JSON data file output that describes all of our instances.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.775
So we have instances,

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:48.200
we have this instance here which has the instance ID like

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.450
so and since type key name, lunchtime.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.010
And then we can use the space bar to just print out the rest.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.220
Public IP address, public DNS name,

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.430
and so on and so forth.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.575
Now we can use and network interface.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.425
Just a bunch of very useful stuff.

00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:17.030
Group, groups, security groups,

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.630
private IP address, owner ID, et cetera.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.435
Okay, So this is very useful, right?

00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:31.970
But it just so much information, right?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.100
So we can actually, what we can do is we can hone in on certain section.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.390
So let's say we want to view, okay,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.720
within reservation we want to view instances,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.550
but we don't want to view all instances that we

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.380
don't want to view everything to do with instances.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.590
Let's say we just want to view the instance ID.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.595
Okay, so we can add a query to our command.

00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:57.875
And we can see that within reservations.

00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.360
Now, this is case sensitive,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.500
so you have to watch out here.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.240
They're using capital letters for the first letter of each word.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.580
So reservations at instances.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.420
Let's say the instance ID, right?

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.385
And so what we're doing is we're getting all reservations.

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:23.090
And then within our reservations were getting all instances and

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.300
methanogenesis and we're getting the instance type, okay?

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.245
And if we run this, there we go.

00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:32.570
We are just getting the instance type right.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.990
Now.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.025
What if we wanted to get owner ID instead, right?

00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:39.965
Order ID is under instances.

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:48.290
I think on Friday is under I think it's within reservations,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:54.360
so we can go ahead and change this.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.694
On Friday.

00:06:57.694 --> 00:07:01.550
And there we go. We're getting the owner ID and so on and so forth.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.520
So you can, you can specify specific for what you want.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.960
Because this is a JSON object,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.920
It's very easy to just traverse it in just fine whatever you want.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.955
Okay?

00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:15.740
So this EC2 instance was created just for the sake of this section, right?

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.395
So let's go ahead and terminate it. We no longer needed.

00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:20.255
We have the ID here.

00:07:20.255 --> 00:07:21.080
Right.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.060
So let's go ahead and just terminate it.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:31.415
We can say AWS EC2, terminate instances right?

00:07:31.415 --> 00:07:33.320
Before we were doing describe instances.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.460
Now we're doing terminate instances, instance IDs.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.065
We can specify more than one,

00:07:39.065 --> 00:07:41.120
but let's go ahead and specify just this one.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.730
So 03 f, one b, c, d,

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:54.590
nine, 15, a 609, one be 91.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.580
And we misspelled instances.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:05.285
There we go, terminally incense current state coterie to shutting down.

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.990
Does instance ID, previous state was running.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.660
Let's go ahead and describe our instances again.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.530
And let's see.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.945
We should be able to see somewhere here,

00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:27.420
It's status, so it's still in use.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.170
All of that. So private IP address,

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.375
so I'm not sure. Okay, there we go.

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:37.650
State.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.300
Usually initiate shutdown.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.635
So soon.

00:08:44.635 --> 00:08:47.260
Once it's finished, select shutting down.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.130
We should not see this anymore.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.040
But essentially we have terminate the instance.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.080
So if you want to make sure that we can go back into the console, the web console,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.004
pull up, pull up our instance,

00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:04.990
and we can see that it is terminated, right?

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.160
So that's, that's pretty cool.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.615
We did all that,

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.625
all of that through the CLI.

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:15.670
So that's just a quick example of how you can use you,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.535
how you can track with EC2 using the aid of a CLI.

00:09:18.535 --> 00:09:24.775
Let us now see what we can do with the, with S3.

00:09:24.775 --> 00:09:29.260
So with S3, we can do quite a bit actually, right?

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.459
So we've already seen that we can S3,

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:40.630
we can list all the buckets and we can even list within each bucket,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.770
so we're going to stay object.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:48.175
So number 1, 8 of this course website, right?

00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:51.460
And we can do quite a bit more as,

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.530
as you saw in documentation.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.810
So we can make our own bucket.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.200
So AWS S3, we can make a bucket.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:07.069
And that's, let's call it test bucket from AWS CLI.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.750
This bucket names are available versus that my name on.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.470
There we go. Remember it has to be universally available the name.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:23.680
So now when we do AWS S3 list,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.200
we can see that we have a new bucket,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.190
test bucket from AWS CLI, smile.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.555
And now we can also try to see if there's anything within it,

00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:41.740
which we don't expect there to be obviously because we just made it right.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.615
So it has bucket from AWS CLI, smile.

00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:49.850
There is no bucket.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.895
Pucker should be a bucket.

00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:54.695
And there's nothing there.

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:59.675
Okay, so we can delete this bucket, right?

00:10:59.675 --> 00:11:02.555
It's empty anyway. So AWS,

00:11:02.555 --> 00:11:04.220
we can use RB,

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.155
which stands for remove bucket.

00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:12.980
And we can just go ahead and delete test bucket from AWS CLI,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.470
smile and AWS S3 ALS.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.620
It hasn't been deleted, okay?

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.190
And we can delete objects as well.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.655
So let's say AWS,

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:35.330
S3, test pocket from AWS.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.890
How we deleted that, right?

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.465
So number 1, AWS course.

00:11:41.465 --> 00:11:43.550
We have one object there,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:49.400
so we can go ahead and S3, remove, remove S3.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.610
Number 1, 8 of this course,

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:58.500
slash copy dot JPEG.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.500
It's very important that you spell stuff correctly if you wanted to work.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.620
And then now when we listed there's nothing there, right?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.600
And now we can, if we wanted to,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.585
we can delete this bucket as well.

00:12:17.585 --> 00:12:19.760
Now you can move objects as well.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.015
So there are a lot more commands.

00:12:23.015 --> 00:12:24.920
Obviously a whole list of them.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.820
So S3, copy, ups,

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.055
eliminated percent or move,

00:12:31.055 --> 00:12:34.560
remove bucket, make bucket.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.085
So many different things.

00:12:37.085 --> 00:12:41.450
Basically, anything you can do with any file on your honor system.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:46.895
So that's a brief introduction to using Amazon S3 with AWS CLI.

00:12:46.895 --> 00:12:52.025
And finally, let's look at IAM.

00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:55.805
So we can create a group.

00:12:55.805 --> 00:13:01.130
Using Create Group, I am Craig group.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.230
Group name would be,

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.990
let's just call it my I am crew.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.470
And now we have this group created, it has this group ID,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.690
it has this ARN, create date,

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.235
group name, et cetera.

00:13:16.235 --> 00:13:18.409
And then we can create a user.

00:13:18.409 --> 00:13:22.050
I am create user.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.130
And the user name, let's just call it my user.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.750
Now we have a user like so.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.590
And now we can add the user to a group type,

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:39.505
AD, user to user name.

00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:47.450
My user group name would be my group.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.420
And to verify that the my IAM group group

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.475
creates or the group contains the my user, user.

00:13:57.475 --> 00:13:59.470
We can use getc group,

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.295
so IM get crew,

00:14:03.295 --> 00:14:08.665
group, name my group.

00:14:08.665 --> 00:14:12.550
And we can see that we have these users,

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.130
which is only my user within that group.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.540
And this is the group, right?

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.345
And so that's an introduction how to use IM with

00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:25.775
AWS CLI and in this video should have given you a good understanding,

00:14:25.775 --> 00:14:29.180
good idea as to how you can use AWS CLI,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.990
basically any service that you learn about on AWS will

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.160
have a way to interact for you to interact with it using the CLI.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.440
And so you just have to look up the documentation.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.185
And I, myself haven't memorized a lot of these commands.

00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:43.730
Just as I need to write,

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.145
I start using them and then as I use them more often,

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:47.915
they just start sticking with me.

00:14:47.915 --> 00:14:51.890
So, yeah, I hope that this section really

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.835
opened up your mind to the possibilities of what,

00:14:55.835 --> 00:14:58.130
you know, what you can do with AWS.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.029
And it should just make you more excited about AWS.

00:15:02.029 --> 00:15:06.620
And it just makes you more enthusiastic to learn about,

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.480
you know, to learn more about AWS and hopefully help you pass your exams.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.970
I will see you in the next video.
