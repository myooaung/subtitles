00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
Now let's talk configuring the AWS CLI.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.725
So this is where things start to get a little bit more fun.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:09.255
Things start to pick up.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.555
And we start actually interacting with the AWS CLI,

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:14.640
even though we're not really directly interacting

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.965
with any of the aid of a services as of yet.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:19.230
That's when things are going to get really fun.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.910
But before we can do that,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.920
we have to configure the CLI so that it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.840
knows who we are and which account will try and access in which region, etc.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840
So it's worth noting that

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.460
all incoming requests are cryptographically signed when using university ally.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.905
So don't worry about that.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:49.010
Don't worry about your access key or secret access key wherever you like

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.520
being exposed as it's traveling back and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.810
forth between your personal computer and the aid of a service or some like that.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.915
So just wanted to make a note of that.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:04.250
And essentially the AWS configure command.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.610
So remember, before any command that we want to issue with ADF or CLI,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.240
we're going to prefix AWS to it.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.090
So that's going to basically specify

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.690
that we're using 80 CLI and then we're going to put in the command.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.865
So the command would be AWS configure,

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:24.155
as I'm going to be showing you,

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:27.590
is the fastest way to set up your radio or the CLI installation.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.540
So there are other ways,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.110
but this is the fastest way and it's a way that you have to definitely know.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.755
And it will ask for the following.

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:43.520
I'll ask for an AWS Access Key ID,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.304
which I'll show you how to find from the AWS console.

00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:51.200
And it'll ask for an AWS secret access key.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.150
Those two go hand in hand.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.460
So they're gonna be, it's gonna be a pair.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.830
Then it's going to ask for default region name so you can leave it blank,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.780
but you should just enter in your default region, right?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.270
The region that you use mostly services on it,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.095
That's going to be the region that you're in or closest to.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:13.850
And then default output format,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.805
which doesn't concern us for this course.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:18.215
So we're just gonna leave that blank.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:20.900
Okay, So let's jump straight into

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.370
the AWS command line interface and start configuring it.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.885
So here we are in our terminal.

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:38.810
So this will be my wound to terminal for you.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.680
It could be, you know, your Windows command prompt or your Mac OS terminal doesn't

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.970
matter because we all have AWS CLI version 2 installed.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.385
And we can go ahead and check that by just,

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.530
you know, which AWS.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.810
For me, it's user local bin,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.710
AWS and AWS version.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.955
There we go.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:02.390
Now, we're going to configure it over here.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.990
So let's go ahead and write configure like so,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.190
this is the command.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.595
So AWS specify that we're using AWS. Cli.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:21.140
And configure is the command that we're specifically referring to within the CLI.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.755
So it's asking us for an AWS Access Key ID. Okay.

00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:31.835
Let's just for just to walk through it,

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:33.710
I'm going to just leave it blank.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.285
So just so you can see.

00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:37.580
So it's going to ask for the access key,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.470
ID, secret access key.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.820
So it's telling me that none has been specified so far now has been specified.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.025
The default region name,

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.695
which is also hasn't been specified,

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.180
and then the default output format,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.995
and then we press Enter, and there we go.

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:55.685
So here we are in the AWS management console,

00:03:55.685 --> 00:04:00.140
which we will actually be needing to find our access

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.715
key and secret access key so that we can configure our AWS CLI,

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:08.165
after which we will no longer need database management console

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:12.154
because we'll be able to do everything directly from the terminal,

00:04:12.154 --> 00:04:13.310
from the command line interface.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.710
So let's just go into

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.350
AIM and let's find our user.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.090
So under users, and this isn't a user I created for myself.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.920
We actually created this together in the second section of this course.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.025
So now we can go ahead and click on it.

00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:45.575
And here we have a tab called security credentials.

00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:48.110
So go ahead and click on that.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.690
And here we have page where we have all the information related to our key,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.270
the access key, sign-in credentials, and so on and so forth.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.830
So we want to focus on this section here.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.450
Access keys, use access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.315
the AWS CLI or tools or PowerShell or AWS SDKs,

00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:13.640
Order Act AWS API calls.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.175
So again, remember we're using CLI,

00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:19.550
SDK and API just interchangeably,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.065
but you know, essentially they're all using the AWS API calls.

00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:27.185
And you can have a maximum of 20 access keys,

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:29.840
active or inactive at a single time.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.675
Now, before we do this,

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:40.415
I have to emphasize how important it is that you keep your access keys secret, okay?

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:44.720
They are equivalent to your root password,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.490
username, and password for your account.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.320
Anybody who has access to

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.270
your access keys can do whatever they want on your account, right?

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.160
So they can go and they can just launch in a million ec2 instances they want to,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.130
and then you'll get a bill for thousands and thousands of dollars, right?

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.175
So you have to be very careful.

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:07.535
Be very careful where you store your access keys.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:10.490
Be very careful who sees them?

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.780
Actually, nobody should see them,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.695
so you should never ever have to share your access key with anybody.

00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:20.180
There are other ways to achieve what you want to achieve by doing that, right?

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.355
If you want to give somebody access your account,

00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.020
you can make them a user.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.005
You can assign a role to them,

00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:30.335
or whatever service they're trying to use to access your account.

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:32.465
Or, you know, like there are many other ways to do it.

00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:34.340
Never share your access keys.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.570
These keys are for you there for a year or so.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.860
That's something I, you know,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.615
I have to really emphasize.

00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:43.820
Security paramount, especially when you're dealing with

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.265
clients and you are dealing with their accounts.

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:50.390
And you have to be extra careful because you might be saying,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.010
you know, nobody wants to my axis here,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.765
but you don't know about your clients, right?

00:06:53.765 --> 00:06:55.850
What if they get hacked or what if you get hacked?

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.365
And now everybody has access to all your clients,

00:07:00.365 --> 00:07:01.760
access keys or something, right?

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.245
So it's very important.

00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:07.085
Security is very important because it will cost you a lot of money.

00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:11.585
Forget reputation, forget all of that embarrassment.

00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:15.980
Just the cost, the financial cost of it will be enormous.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.930
You know, people, you know,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.730
there are January trolls out there.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.730
If they do get access key,

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.680
they'll just go and try to spot as many instances and

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.435
services as possible just so they can at no cost to you and they just,

00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:35.045
they gain benefit from something like that.

00:07:35.045 --> 00:07:37.085
They see it as fun.

00:07:37.085 --> 00:07:39.530
So you've got to really be careful.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.460
And if you lose or forget received axis because you cannot retrieve it instead,

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.620
create a new axis, can make the old key inactive.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.440
So if something does happen like that,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.500
if there is a breach or you do fear

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.905
that somebody might have an accessory axis here, something like that.

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:57.470
You can come in here and delete it and I'll show you how I did that right now.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.770
So the first thing we wanna do is actually create an access key.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.350
So we click create access key.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.440
Now, I'm going to be deleting this before we launch it.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.320
So it's okay for you to see it, okay.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.840
You're not going be able to use this by a times v2 launches,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.340
but don't get into the habit of doing this.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.665
Don't show people your access keys, okay?

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.500
So you can download as a CSV file,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.935
just like we download our the keys before.

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:28.205
Or you can just access directly from here.

00:08:28.205 --> 00:08:30.965
But once you close this window, right?

00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:33.995
Once you close it, it's gone.

00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:35.330
You have the access key,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.955
but you don't have the secret access key.

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:38.810
Okay.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.820
And there's no way to find it anymore.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.470
You we didn't download it and we didn't copy it.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.300
So this right now is useless for us.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.320
We can't use it.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.530
So the only thing we can do is we can make it inactive,

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.310
deactivate, and delete it.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.320
So to delete it,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.500
we're just going to like so.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.730
And there we go.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.935
Now we can create a new access key.

00:09:00.935 --> 00:09:06.395
And it'll generate a new one for us so we can download it and access it like this.

00:09:06.395 --> 00:09:14.630
Or we can just copy and paste it from here because I'm just going to use for this video,

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.970
It's okay that we don't download it,

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.080
but what we're going to be doing is now that we have the access key,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.780
ID and the secret access key.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:31.340
We can go into our terminal and we can configure our command line interface.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.930
So for the access key,

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.660
Let's go ahead and copy this.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.150
And for the secret access key.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.450
Again, let's copy this from the default region name.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.150
I'm in US East 2.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.115
And we're going to leave this blank.

00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:49.865
And there we go.

00:09:49.865 --> 00:09:52.805
We have configured the AWS CLI,

00:09:52.805 --> 00:09:55.895
and there are couple of ways we can check if that worked or not.

00:09:55.895 --> 00:10:00.890
The first would be to just run AWS configure again. And there we go.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.815
We can see that we have a specified,

00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:08.780
we have already specified an access key ID and it's ending in DC. If I B.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.995
And that's correct.

00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.380
And if we just keep going,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.635
I will see that we also have a secret access key for it.

00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:18.574
And the default region as US East H2.

00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:21.755
And we have not specified a default output format.

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:27.200
So we have successfully configured AWS CLI.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.900
Another way to check for that would be to check where

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:38.240
actually like where the Ada was actually stores the credentials and the configuration.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.890
So that would be for my,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.540
you know, I'm using a Linux system.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:47.795
So it would be within AWS, AWS, My bad.

00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:52.295
So within AWS, there will be.

00:10:52.295 --> 00:10:53.915
So if you see,

00:10:53.915 --> 00:10:56.420
if you go into your folder,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.820
you'll see AWS here.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:03.755
And then if you just print out everything that's in that folder,

00:11:03.755 --> 00:11:07.015
you'll see that there are two folders, config and credential.

00:11:07.015 --> 00:11:09.875
So the configuration details will be stored

00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:13.205
in config and the credentials will be sorting credentials.

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:18.020
And we can print out each of them just to see what's there.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.000
So we can see that the configuration,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.640
the only thing we've configured so far has been

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.080
the region which we've configured to be US, dash, dash two.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.495
So that's where the default profile.

00:11:29.495 --> 00:11:31.655
We can create multiple profiles as well.

00:11:31.655 --> 00:11:34.685
And you can see for each profile, once you've configured.

00:11:34.685 --> 00:11:41.960
Now let's also print out the details of the credentials folder file.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:47.060
And then here we can see that we can actually see our access key,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.280
ID and secret access key.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:56.150
So this is very good that you can see this right now. Why?

00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:02.085
Because it should reinforce the fact that you should never be using

00:12:02.085 --> 00:12:04.685
your access key ID and your secret access key

00:12:04.685 --> 00:12:08.705
on any other device other than your own personal computer.

00:12:08.705 --> 00:12:09.110
Why?

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:14.930
Because once you've configured any AWS CLI to your account,

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.000
essentially your sigma axis key,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.680
annual access key ID are being saved openly onto that device, right?

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.195
So if this was,

00:12:23.195 --> 00:12:24.800
you know, if, if I had done this,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.140
all of this in an EC2 instance,

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.310
which is not secure,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.395
which is not a device that I own.

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:31.640
It's not my own device, right?

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.900
It's AWS device.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.905
If somebody were to access that instance,

00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:40.370
they will be able to see my ID and secret access key.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.080
And then I can take this and they can use this to

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.750
configure their own computer to my account,

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.730
and then they can do whatever they want.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.275
They could just wreak havoc, right?

00:12:48.275 --> 00:12:54.155
So this is very important to reinforce what I've been saying.

00:12:54.155 --> 00:12:58.640
Only use these credentials on your own personal computer.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.285
Okay.

00:12:59.285 --> 00:13:03.140
Now, that's pretty much we've configured AWS CLI.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.335
We can now start using the CLI.

00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:08.615
We're going to be doing that in the next video.

00:13:08.615 --> 00:13:11.045
But are a couple of you,

00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:12.830
not next week but the one after it.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.145
But just to show you that it actually works,

00:13:16.145 --> 00:13:20.225
we can do like AWS, S3, ls.

00:13:20.225 --> 00:13:24.140
So we're querying, we're using the S3 API

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.320
directly and we're listing out the bucket we have.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.760
And remember we had the number 1,

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.960
a diverse chorus bucket.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.540
And then we have number 1 eight MOs course website bucket.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.615
And we're able to see this directly on our computer,

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:38.539
directly from the command line interface.

00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:41.960
And we're accessing our S3 service on our,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.040
on our ADLS account.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.270
So that's really cool, right?

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.905
That should just amazing, right?

00:13:45.905 --> 00:13:47.225
First time I, you know,

00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:50.645
I discovered the power of the AWS CLI I was amazed.

00:13:50.645 --> 00:13:53.165
So that's just a little taste as to what we can do.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:56.720
Obviously, we're gonna be doing some more later on and throughout the course.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.940
And that was my intention for introducing you to

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.695
the AWS CLI from the very beginning so that,

00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:06.530
you know, occasionally I I can show you how to do

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.440
some of the stuff we're learning on AWS CLI as well.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.490
And so you're not just stuck learning how to do everything on the console,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.670
but learn how to do it programmatically as well.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:22.235
So, so this is pretty much how you can configure AWS CLI for your Mac OS,

00:14:22.235 --> 00:14:27.425
Windows, Linux, or any other device that you have 8 over CLI installed on.

00:14:27.425 --> 00:14:31.670
But when it comes to configuring AWS CLI on an EC2 instance,

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.085
because now it's not going to be a device that you,

00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:36.695
yourself, ONE, it's going to be slightly different.

00:14:36.695 --> 00:14:39.125
The best practice for that is slightly different.

00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:41.300
And in the next video I'm going to be showing you that.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.710
But following that video,

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:48.090
we're going to start actually interacting with AWS services directly.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.230
I will see you in the next video.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.070
Thanks, buh-bye.
