00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:11.085
In this section, we're going to be going over AWS CLI or AWS command line interface.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:17.835
And generally, people might introduce this topic later on.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.875
After a couple more of the fundamental concepts of AWS haven't covered.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.384
But I'm choosing to introduce it in this section

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:32.520
because the earlier you get your hands on the CLI,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.590
the better it will be for you.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.010
Because the real power of AWS lies in being able to utilize the CLI

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.660
and the SDK and the public APIs for the various AWS services.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.830
So that's what's going to set you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.810
apart from the commoners out there who just are using AWS.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.795
But don't really know anything about it.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:07.130
Is that you're going to be able to basically manipulate and work

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.430
with any of the AWS resources or services

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.360
directly from the command line or from your coding environment,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.580
your programming environment using the SDK.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.285
So it's important that at least, at the very least,

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:25.145
we know how to set it up and we know how to run commands on it.

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:29.420
Even if in this course we're not going to be going into actual development and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.705
actual automation as that's outside the scope of this course.

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:40.190
At least you're going to have the tools ready for you and available to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.065
you to take that path if you choose to do so.

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:50.660
And I would suggest that you choose to do so as soon as possible, the sooner the better.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.725
So when we're talking about the AWS CLI,

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:59.690
we're also referring to the SDK and the API.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:09.160
So essentially behind the CLI is access to the APIs that the service is provided for you.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.000
But let's first define what the CLI is, right?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.960
I'm sure you've heard of it, but it doesn't hurt to define it.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.155
So it's an open source tool that enables you to interact with

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:24.430
AWS services using commands in your command line shell.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.835
And you might say,

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:29.440
what's the point of this?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.545
Trust me, this is incredibly powerful.

00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:36.445
This is where the true power of AWS lies.

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:40.705
So even if you are not able to grasp that as of yet,

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:46.610
just take my word for it and invest your time and resources into mastering the CLI.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.705
So it provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.240
So all these services that we've been learning about,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.600
everything from IAM to S3 to EC2 plus everything else we're going to be learning about

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.685
has public APIs that you can use to control those services are those resources.

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:14.855
The CLI is basically giving you access those APIs through a command line interface.

00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:18.545
Okay, So what's really being done is,

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:21.079
you know, everything's been converted into API.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.240
Requests on the backend.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.100
And that's why when I say CLI and also from the SDK,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.365
because SDK that does the same thing,

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:37.055
it also gives you direct access to the public APIs of AWS services in the back-end.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:41.000
But it gives you a coding or programming front end to do so.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.730
So we're not going to be covering the SDK in this course,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.080
but it's essentially the same thing.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.659
It's going to be the same control you have over the AWS services and resources,

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.760
except the environment is going to be different.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.105
In the case of CLI, It's just directly from your command line shell.

00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:57.965
In the case of an SDK,

00:03:57.965 --> 00:03:59.870
it'll be from your programming environment,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.705
whether it be Python or C plus plus or whatever, right?

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:07.870
And basically you are able to communicate with AWS resources

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.515
and services using a command line interface.

00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:16.360
And that allows you to manage all eight of our services and control them.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.420
And it allows you to automate AWS,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.615
infrastructure, resources and service management.

00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:26.605
And that's because essentially everything that you would normally

00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:31.405
do using click and drop interface on Dataverse console,

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:36.430
you'll be doing by sending commands which are written, right?

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.670
So this means you can potentially compile these commands into

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.200
a file like a bash script or something and run them.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.410
And then basically program some sort of

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.020
sequence in which different commands are run in different resources are allocated,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.970
different services are configured,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.990
so on and so forth on AWS based on your code and that kind of stuff.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.955
So basically we're automating everything, right?

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:04.535
And there's gonna be a lot of examples for that.

00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:07.655
This is not a developer course, right?

00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.725
This is a solution architect course.

00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:12.290
So we won't be relying too much on the CLI.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.670
But essentially, you know,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.320
if you do choose to be an ETA was developer,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.230
this is something you have to master and even if you don't,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.180
I would highly recommend it.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.160
So all IAAS Infrastructure as a Service,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.290
it was administration management,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.800
and access functions in the ADFS Management Console are

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.820
available in the AWS API and CLI, okay?

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.095
Now, when new services become available or new features and get released by AWS,

00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:45.575
they will either immediately have access through the API

00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:50.375
or a 180 days after launch, right?

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:54.560
And by the way, so when I'm saying API and CLI SDKs

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.780
all because all of it relies on the APIs of the services, right?

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.805
The fact that each service has an API that you can use to manipulate it,

00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:07.700
or to configure it, or to use it or whatever.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:14.630
And the CLI and SDK or both using APIs in the back-end right there using the same APIs,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.940
it's just a front end interface is different if it's an SDK or the, or the CLI.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.190
So don't get confused if I,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.480
if I use them interchangeably.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.990
But in this course and specific in this section,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.180
we're focusing on the CLI.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.955
And I'm gonna be showing you how to set the CLI up for Windows,

00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:37.700
Mac OS, and Linux.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.180
But I myself will be using Linux to use data whereas council,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.640
but once you have or the AWS CLI,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.335
but once you have it installed on MacOS or Windows or Linux,

00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:53.030
it's going to be the same,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.580
basically, same commands, same functions, right?

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.965
And I'm going to show you exactly how to do all that.

00:06:57.965 --> 00:07:03.065
And then I'm going to also be showing you how to set it up on an EC2 instance as well.

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:06.110
Because you might want programmatic access to

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.890
AWS services through an EC2 instance, right?

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.100
For some more complex architecture, right?

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.350
Maybe you want your easy to instance to basically

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.910
initiate the formation of different services and that kinda stuff.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.275
And you know, it's part of your larger infrastructure,

00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:25.640
large application or whatever.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.970
So, but there's a special way to go about doing that.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.135
I'm using IAM role.

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:35.600
And so I'm going to be showing you all of that in this section.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.480
So that concludes the introduction.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.335
And let's jump right into the next video.

00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:44.610
Thanks, buh-bye.
