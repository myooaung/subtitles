00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
Hello and welcome to this hands on walk-through where I will

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.525
be helping you practically apply everything we've learned in the past video.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:14.715
When it comes to IAM and you know how to create users groups,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.419
how to assign policies, and that kind of stuff.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.110
So this will be a very practical walkthrough.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.734
And in general, throughout this course,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.149
expect to learn the most from these hands-on videos.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.114
If you're studying solely for the,

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.950
for the exam, obviously the presentations will be important for you.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.059
The slides and any documentation that you can find on AWS.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.545
Because you'll have to memorize terms and definitions in Afghanistan.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:50.074
But in general, AWS is best learned by an application in getting your hands dirty,

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:53.719
trying stuff out, and just experimenting.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.190
And that's what we're gonna do.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.380
And to the best of my ability,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.039
I'm going to try to keep this as laid back as possible.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.880
I don't want to give the impression that you should have everything

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.989
memorized and know exactly where everything is and just nowhere.

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.074
Click through everything and you're done.

00:01:11.074 --> 00:01:13.835
And because most of the time that's not going to be the case

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:17.554
when you do require the use of a particular service.

00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:20.839
You might not know everything about it and you might have to click around a little

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:24.364
bit and just play around and discover some stuff on your own.

00:01:24.364 --> 00:01:27.530
And that's generally the best way to approach all the services in

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.115
AWS because as you can see from here,

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:35.465
or we can just click on the upper left corner.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:38.959
Aws gives us access to a lot of services.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.080
So there are a ton of services here in

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.410
everything from computation services to storage services,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.169
Database Services, Machine Learning Services.

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:52.880
So it's a pretty long list.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.804
There's no way we can cover all of this and

00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:59.330
no other course would ever give an attempt to cover all of it.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.409
But I'm going to try to give you as much as possible for

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.794
the services will pretty much cover 80 percent of your AWS needs.

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:12.274
Remaining services you can learn on an as-needed basis.

00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:13.789
So for example, EC2,

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.475
light sail, S3 RDS.

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:21.425
These type of services will pretty much be used in any application.

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:25.564
And so they're crucial and definitely covered in the exam.

00:02:25.564 --> 00:02:31.039
And, but then others are, are less common or the more specific to particular use cases.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:38.824
Or they pertain to another specific AWS Certificate or another exam.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:43.175
So it's another domain completely and we don't need to worry about it.

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:44.930
But for this video,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.584
we're concerned with IAM.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:51.289
So we want to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:56.870
create users and groups and manage them and assign policies and so on and so forth.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.775
So we want to use the IAM service.

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:03.244
By the way, I do apologize.

00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:04.370
I might, you know,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.439
in the last videos where I get confused,

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.579
sometimes I might have referred to IAM as AIM,

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.430
and don't let those two things get mixed up.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.855
There's another thing called AIM in AWS that we will be learning about.

00:03:17.855 --> 00:03:22.130
So everything in this section is concerned with IAM.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.409
So if I've ever said AIM,

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.455
just assume it to be IAM,

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.719
identity and Access Management.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.349
So there are a couple of ways to access IAM.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.170
I am as a service after all.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.989
So just like any of the other services, it's a surface,

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.534
so it has its own dashboard and its own area.

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:47.539
And so we can access it just as we would any other server.

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:52.565
So probably the easiest way to do it would be by using the unified search with which

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:58.280
is a new feature that AWS recently started implementing.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.909
So basically you can type in whatever you have in your mind.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.794
If you don't remember the abbreviation IAM,

00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:08.404
you can just type in identity and access management.

00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:09.799
If you do remember that relation,

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.515
you can type that in whatever AWS will do its best to find it for you. So let's type in.

00:04:15.515 --> 00:04:16.805
I am.

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:18.665
And there we go.

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:21.349
Aws instantly finds that service for us.

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:26.690
So under services it finds the closest matching ones.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.684
So I am manage access to AWS services.

00:04:31.684 --> 00:04:32.809
There we go.

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:38.930
Okay. And it also lists some of the top features within that service.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.724
So you can go directly into groups under IAM.

00:04:42.724 --> 00:04:47.615
Roles or policies or users are vendor's documentation.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:50.000
Other stuff that we're not concerned with.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.610
So you can access it directly from here,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.799
or you can from this page where you can see all the services,

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:01.219
which is basically the same thing as this drop down here.

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.204
We can go into security,

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:07.970
identity and compliance, and it's the top service.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.084
There's everything to do with security identity and compliance is listed here.

00:05:13.084 --> 00:05:17.630
But obviously the number one central inner most important one is I am,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.299
this is like the center of the central hub,

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:23.704
if you will, for all your security and identity needs.

00:05:23.704 --> 00:05:26.209
So before we go into that,

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:30.395
let me draw your attention to something.

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:31.744
So if you notice,

00:05:31.744 --> 00:05:33.934
I'm in the Ohio region,

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:38.119
US East Ohio us dash, dash T2.

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:42.605
In your case, whatever region is closest to you,

00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:45.289
wherever you are in the world or in the US,

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.720
whatever regions causes to you this is supposed

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.509
to be the closest to where I'm based out of,

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.269
but could just as well be anywhere else.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:56.989
And obviously this list keeps getting longer and longer.

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:03.800
But not all services on AWS require the selection of a particular region.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.040
So when you're dealing with actual hardware,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.539
when dealing with stuff like EC2 or RDS or S3 or whatever,

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:17.930
you're going to have to pick a region in which that service will be used.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.009
And that particular instance of a view of your using

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.000
our service will be specific to that region.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.439
And in fact, some services might not be available in all regions.

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:35.434
However, there are some services that are global and

00:06:35.434 --> 00:06:42.004
that are applied to all the regions and are not region-specific.

00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:47.420
So I am happens to be one of those services.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.869
So if you keep your eye on Ohio here,

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.074
as I click on IAM,

00:06:53.074 --> 00:06:56.284
you're going to see that it changes to global.

00:06:56.284 --> 00:06:59.599
And if we pull down the regions drop-down,

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.899
you'll see that I am does not require regions selection.

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.990
In fact, you're not even allowed to select any region.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.834
So anything you do in IAM is directly applicable to other regions.

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:12.844
And so you don't have to worry about that at all.

00:07:12.844 --> 00:07:16.189
So once we click on IAM,

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.685
were immediately presented with the IAM dashboard.

00:07:19.685 --> 00:07:23.450
And this is basically where you have access to everything you need.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.810
And it's pretty similar to other dashboards.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:34.624
You'll find on AWS and contains some extra links are on the right just to help you out.

00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:36.619
You know, best practices,

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:40.449
security alerts, What's new?

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.565
This is all just extra stuff.

00:07:42.565 --> 00:07:45.084
And then we have two main sections.

00:07:45.084 --> 00:07:47.259
On the left, we have access management,

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:50.139
access reports, access report.

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:53.530
We don't really need right now.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.175
Something that's, that's a more advanced topic.

00:07:57.175 --> 00:08:00.999
But we do want access management.

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:03.205
So unreal access management we have groups,

00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:05.050
uses, roles and policies,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.169
which are the main things we're going to be concerned with.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:10.104
For this video.

00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:12.070
And in the dashboard,

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.530
you have your IM resources.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.724
So here you can see the number of users, groups or roles,

00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:22.225
identity providers and customer managed policies you have.

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:26.395
So we are given two default roles by AWS.

00:08:26.395 --> 00:08:29.799
So the IID not create these and you should also see two here.

00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:32.605
And they should have been created by default, by AWS.

00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:34.854
However, when it comes to users or groups,

00:08:34.854 --> 00:08:41.709
currently we have 0 because this is my root in I did use my root credentials,

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:44.530
my root user to access this account just as you

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.274
have twins that I haven't created any users yet.

00:08:47.274 --> 00:08:50.304
And I'm just using the email I use to sign up for the account.

00:08:50.304 --> 00:08:51.759
Which again, like we said,

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:53.770
is not good practice.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.799
So the first thing we wanna do is create a user.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:58.705
So let's go ahead and click on.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.414
We can click on this,

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:05.390
or we can just go and access management on the left and click on Users.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:10.279
Hear you, you will see a list of all your users eventually when you do have users,

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.765
but currently we have none.

00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:14.359
And then some additional information about your users.

00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:16.654
So which groups they belong to?

00:09:16.654 --> 00:09:19.355
The how all the password is,

00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:24.320
how long ago they last used there credentials to

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.630
basically login and whether or not they have MFA or multi-factor authentication.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.669
Now, we have no users,

00:09:31.669 --> 00:09:35.074
so there's no point in spending time on this page currently.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:37.084
Let's go ahead and add a user.

00:09:37.084 --> 00:09:40.040
And the first user you create, you know, as we said,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.819
it's generally good practice that you create yourself and user.

00:09:43.819 --> 00:09:48.499
I'm immediately as soon as you create an AWS account and that user will

00:09:48.499 --> 00:09:53.209
be the user you'll use essentially to access your account instead of the root user.

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:58.025
And then from there you can continue creating other users and you are going to do.

00:09:58.025 --> 00:09:58.835
So.

00:09:58.835 --> 00:09:59.990
Since my name is Ismail,

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.299
I'm going to be creating a user called a smile.

00:10:02.299 --> 00:10:06.065
You can just create a user with any name.

00:10:06.065 --> 00:10:08.899
You know your name, just create one with your name.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:16.009
And I can add as many users as I can create essentially as many users as the one at once.

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:18.800
But we're not going to really be using this feature at the moment

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.154
because we don't have a team or,

00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:22.760
you know, this is an example, right?

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.479
But, you know, if you did have a team and you wanted,

00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:28.730
for example, all the developers on the team to immediately

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.355
be created using the same settings.

00:10:31.355 --> 00:10:33.559
You can just create them all at once.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:35.644
What we don't need to do that.

00:10:35.644 --> 00:10:42.694
So I wanna give this user complete programmatic access.

00:10:42.694 --> 00:10:47.104
So this is essentially because we're creating this user for ourselves.

00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:49.639
It's going to be the second most powerful or count

00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:52.489
per second most powerful user after the root user.

00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:55.490
So we want to give it as much access as possible.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.969
We definitely want to give it access to the management console.

00:10:58.969 --> 00:11:01.520
And here it's up to you.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.140
You can do whatever you want in these settings,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.049
but I generally prefer an auto-generated password.

00:11:06.049 --> 00:11:09.440
I don't like typing in actual passwords,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.194
but you could do that if you wanted.

00:11:11.194 --> 00:11:12.559
You could do that if you wanted to.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:15.320
But if you click auto-generated password,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:22.639
you will be able to download the password and the user will be able to use that password.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:25.579
And then I always require password reset.

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:28.054
So this forces the user,

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:31.625
the first time they use those credentials to log in.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:35.465
It forces him, him or her to create a new password.

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:38.660
So that's good for security reasons.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.854
So now we haven't talked about policies yet.

00:11:41.854 --> 00:11:48.169
But if you do allow for password reset or you do require Password Reset,

00:11:48.169 --> 00:11:50.495
the user is automatically assigned,

00:11:50.495 --> 00:11:52.969
are attached the i, i,

00:11:52.969 --> 00:11:55.940
a user change password policy.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.339
So we're going to see this later on.

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:01.565
But essentially, this is where that data comes from.

00:12:01.565 --> 00:12:04.160
If you're confused as to why when you create a user,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.685
it's automatic attached a policy called IAM user change password.

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.334
This is where that comes from.

00:12:09.334 --> 00:12:12.079
So at this point,

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:15.580
if we had any groups that we had already created,

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.119
can assign this user to that group if in this case we don't.

00:12:20.119 --> 00:12:22.549
So we can actually create a group directly from here.

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:24.365
But for now we're not going to,

00:12:24.365 --> 00:12:26.539
because I want to show you guys how to create just a user

00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:29.359
first and then we'll create a group later on.

00:12:29.359 --> 00:12:35.494
So we want to attach policies that will basically give

00:12:35.494 --> 00:12:38.269
this user access to

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:43.669
different services or different resources and give it different permissions.

00:12:43.669 --> 00:12:46.309
So we click on Attach existing policies directly.

00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:51.290
So this will be the Amazon, amazon Managed Policies.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.785
And as you can see, there's quite a long list.

00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:58.310
And it keeps getting longer and longer as you scroll.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:04.130
These are all policies that Amazon has predefined for us.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.359
And this saves us a lot of time and effort.

00:13:08.359 --> 00:13:11.479
Because pretty much any type of or

00:13:11.479 --> 00:13:15.169
any set for combination of permissions you might want to give.

00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:22.880
A user is most probably defined in some way or another within this list.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.910
So, but if not,

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:29.585
and you have experienced early with AWS and you've already

00:13:29.585 --> 00:13:34.310
used AWS managed policies and you want to define or create your own policy,

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.260
you can do so from here.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.670
And we're not gonna do that now because we don't want to confuse ourselves, right?

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.700
We were just learning how to use policies are and all that.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.054
So we're going to ignore that for now.

00:13:46.054 --> 00:13:49.369
But you can search for let's search if

00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:52.760
there is any policy that has to do with like admin access.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.940
Because our users are creating now is essentially,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.950
will essentially be the admin, right?

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.850
We said he's going to be the second most powerful user after the user.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.370
So let's type in admin.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.709
And there we go, We have quite a few,

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:10.085
but the top one pretty much will do the job for us, right?

00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:11.615
Administrator access.

00:14:11.615 --> 00:14:15.574
And we can open this up to see exactly what

00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:20.720
this policy gives access to within the policy summary.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.449
So here we can see that we have this policy will give us

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:32.720
access to 264 out of 264 services.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.960
So it'll give us access to all the services on AWS.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.590
So there are 264 services and we will have access to all of them.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.424
Let's find some that we might be familiar with.

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:45.545
Let's see, billing, right?

00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:48.859
We have full access to billing and all of its resources.

00:14:48.859 --> 00:14:50.389
What else?

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:53.389
What's something that okay, So EC2,

00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:57.455
we have full access to ec2 and all its resources.

00:14:57.455 --> 00:15:02.029
So this is a very useful policy for us at, at this moment.

00:15:02.029 --> 00:15:06.455
But obviously when you're creating policies for our new creating users,

00:15:06.455 --> 00:15:09.260
other than your own user.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.910
You don't want, you most probably will not want to give them.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:19.790
You most probably will not want to attach the administrator access policy to their user.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.629
Because you probably don't want other people to have

00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:28.235
as much control as you do over your own account and buy. In our case, we do.

00:15:28.235 --> 00:15:32.164
But we could depending on whatever you want, right?

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:33.215
You just want, for example,

00:15:33.215 --> 00:15:35.690
EC2, somebody with EC2.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.700
So everything to do with EC2 policies will be listed here.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.585
So for example, EC2 instance, instance connect.

00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:48.814
So it gives you access to two services only.

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:53.390
It gives access to ec2 instance connect full access our resources.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.860
And EC2 only gives you access to a limited number of resources

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:03.020
from EC2 far No All resources but the access level is limited.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.869
So this is an example obviously.

00:16:05.869 --> 00:16:07.834
So based on your needs,

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:09.064
you'll have to find the,

00:16:09.064 --> 00:16:11.855
the policies that you would like to use.

00:16:11.855 --> 00:16:14.585
An attached to the users you are creating.

00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:17.569
In the worst case, you can just create your own policy.

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:25.519
And so I mentioned in the last video that policy that actually defined as JSON objects.

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:27.229
So if you're familiar,

00:16:27.229 --> 00:16:30.305
if you've worked with web technologies before,

00:16:30.305 --> 00:16:32.690
you should know what a JSON object is.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.439
I'm essentially, if we click on JSON here,

00:16:36.439 --> 00:16:40.595
we will, we can see the policy in its JSON form.

00:16:40.595 --> 00:16:43.730
So maybe if you continue using AWS and you get better

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.850
and better and maybe you become an AWS developer and stuff,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.580
then you can actually start writing your policies as

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.140
JSON objects or in a sharing them or are finding them online, that kind of stuff.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.135
So but for our purposes.

00:16:57.135 --> 00:17:01.570
The policy summary is enough for us to understand what we're dealing with.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.290
And then we can create tags for the users.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:10.150
So I am tags are key value pairs you can add to your user.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.349
Tags can include user information such as e-mail addresses.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:18.295
Or they can even just be a description.

00:17:18.295 --> 00:17:27.759
Like such as job title or their position or their role in the team or whatever, right?

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:30.039
And you can use the tags to organize, track,

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:32.874
or control access for each user.

00:17:32.874 --> 00:17:35.830
So since we're not going to create too many users,

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.210
it doesn't really matter for us.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.929
But if you're dealing with hundreds and hundreds of users, right?

00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:41.855
Or even just tens of users.

00:17:41.855 --> 00:17:44.839
It does end up getting pretty messy.

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:49.429
And you do want a way to easily organize and to easily find important information.

00:17:49.429 --> 00:17:53.210
Like for example, you might want to find the theremin.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.829
I'd like an email is my Gmail and say, you know,

00:17:57.829 --> 00:18:00.664
this is my actual email, but as an example,

00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:04.159
or maybe they have like a company ID.

00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:08.645
Company id, his company ideas,

00:18:08.645 --> 00:18:12.109
you know, whatever I want to teach for 56.

00:18:12.109 --> 00:18:13.954
And then like.

00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:15.739
So.

00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:17.840
This is intended for you,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.024
for you to easily organize and just track your users.

00:18:22.024 --> 00:18:24.770
And so you can just add whatever you want here.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.869
And then we can review everything.

00:18:26.869 --> 00:18:29.269
We create a user called the smile.

00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:33.529
We gave him programmatic access and AWS management console access.

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:38.314
We are auto-generated password and we do require a password reset.

00:18:38.314 --> 00:18:40.700
And these are the policies that we've attached.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.864
We've attached the administrator access policy.

00:18:43.864 --> 00:18:48.350
But the IAM user change password policy has also been

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:53.600
attached because we have required password reset.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.789
And then these are the tags that we assigned and all of this can be changed later.

00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:01.069
So don't worry about it, right?

00:19:01.069 --> 00:19:03.469
Let's create our user.

00:19:03.469 --> 00:19:05.674
And success.

00:19:05.674 --> 00:19:08.780
We have successfully created the user shown below.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.550
In our case, it's only one user.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.669
And you can view and download user's security credentials.

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:16.490
You can also email users instructions directly from

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.014
here for signing into database management console.

00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:26.779
This is the last time these credentials will be available to download.

00:19:26.779 --> 00:19:30.979
However, you can create new credentials at any time, et cetera.

00:19:30.979 --> 00:19:36.784
So users with AWS management console access can sign in at this URL.

00:19:36.784 --> 00:19:39.664
Now you might be wondering how I got this number.

00:19:39.664 --> 00:19:41.870
Dash one, dash AWS dash course,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.489
I'm going to show you how to do that,

00:19:43.489 --> 00:19:44.689
but in your case,

00:19:44.689 --> 00:19:48.169
you'll see your account ID here.

00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:54.754
So this link your users can now use to login to your account using their credentials.

00:19:54.754 --> 00:19:58.460
So here if you click download that CSV,

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.035
that's what I generally do.

00:20:00.035 --> 00:20:03.619
You'll get an Excel file or a CSV file that you can open up

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:08.449
an Excel that will have your user login credentials,

00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:15.020
the username, and the password that your user can now use using this link to login.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.239
Let's close this.

00:20:17.239 --> 00:20:18.860
And.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:26.254
We can see now that we have one user and the users feature here. We have one.

00:20:26.254 --> 00:20:32.150
So the username, this file with a capital I password was created today.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.325
He belongs to no groups.

00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:36.635
He hasn't logged on ever,

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:39.635
and he doesn't have MFA enabled.

00:20:39.635 --> 00:20:42.425
Now, let's go back into the dashboard for a second.

00:20:42.425 --> 00:20:48.410
And here you should see your sign-in URL for IAM users.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.225
So in your case,

00:20:50.225 --> 00:20:51.860
let's delete the alias.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.259
In your case it's going to be something like this, right?

00:20:54.259 --> 00:20:57.439
And this is your account ID.

00:20:57.439 --> 00:20:59.060
So in my case it's 4,

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.325
3, 2, all the way to 94.

00:21:01.325 --> 00:21:04.070
And you can find that out from here.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.574
So if you go into an ident,

00:21:06.574 --> 00:21:11.209
identity access management, at the bottom you'll see AWS account ID,

00:21:11.209 --> 00:21:13.370
and this will be your account ID.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:20.090
And by default, the sign-in URL for IAM users is either your account ID dot signup,

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.419
dot AWS dot amazon.com, forward slash console.

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:27.590
But you can customize this to make it easier for your users login.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:32.345
And in my case I called it number one AWS course.

00:21:32.345 --> 00:21:35.239
It does have to be unique, right?

00:21:35.239 --> 00:21:39.394
For example, AWS course might be taken already created.

00:21:39.394 --> 00:21:42.860
Yeah, there's a carry, these are already exists.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.775
So number one, there might be,

00:21:46.775 --> 00:21:48.229
there might be many native as courses,

00:21:48.229 --> 00:21:50.510
but there's only one number one, right?

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.994
So we create an alias. And there we go.

00:21:54.994 --> 00:21:58.999
Now, this link can be used for,

00:21:58.999 --> 00:22:02.794
you know, for IAM users to access your account.

00:22:02.794 --> 00:22:07.520
Now, we can now see that we have one user down here.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.800
And if we click on it,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.400
it's the one we just created and click on it.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.780
Once again, we have access to all the details that we specified.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.025
So immediately you have access to the permissions that this user has.

00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:24.815
And these are defined as policies.

00:22:24.815 --> 00:22:27.889
And there are two policies that have been applied.

00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:31.700
Now, we can delete them and add other ones as well.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.319
So here I just want to,

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:35.269
I just want you as you're comfortable,

00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:38.569
just playing around and not be hesitant, right?

00:22:38.569 --> 00:22:41.960
Many times people are afraid that they might make

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.540
a mistake that's irreversible or something like that.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.009
So I want to show you how easy it is to undo stuff and delete stuff,

00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:51.799
add stuff back in accuracy so we can, for example,

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:57.844
go ahead and delete adversary axis booty touching this policy from this user.

00:22:57.844 --> 00:23:04.489
And now he only has the IAM user change password policy attached.

00:23:04.489 --> 00:23:06.785
But we can add permissions.

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:10.025
We can go into Attach existing policies directly,

00:23:10.025 --> 00:23:14.044
find the administrator access policy selected,

00:23:14.044 --> 00:23:17.929
go into review, accept these permissions.

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:20.914
And there we go.

00:23:20.914 --> 00:23:24.320
The user now has administrator access policy again.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.724
So it's very easy to just play around with this.

00:23:27.724 --> 00:23:29.720
You know, don't, don't, don't hesitate

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.589
if your users contact us as you know what happened.

00:23:33.589 --> 00:23:34.970
I don't have access. It's okay.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.309
Just come into the committee users,

00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:39.800
click on the username or the group.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.769
If they have a group that's assigned to them and click

00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:46.760
on just open up the permissions and see what they have access to.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.829
Now, let's look into the IAM user change password policy.

00:23:51.829 --> 00:23:55.250
And let's see what this positive gives you permission for.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:01.129
So it allows, it gives you permission for one of 364 services.

00:24:01.129 --> 00:24:05.149
And that is the IAM service.

00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:07.159
And it doesn't give you access to everything in

00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:10.040
IAM gives you access to multiple resources,

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.780
but not all resources.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.320
And it only gives you limited read and write access.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:20.099
So if we open up the administrator access policy,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.554
open that up, take some time to load because there are 264 services.

00:24:26.554 --> 00:24:29.359
And we typed in, I am here.

00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:35.360
We'll see that we actually have full access to all IAM resources.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.550
So this is actually redundant.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.314
There's no need for the service because we already have access to all of it.

00:24:41.314 --> 00:24:42.680
All of I am.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.589
So we can actually remove the surface.

00:24:45.589 --> 00:24:49.640
We can detach it from not not the service, but this policy.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.009
We can detach this policy because this covers

00:24:52.009 --> 00:24:54.799
everything pretty much so now we just have one policy.

00:24:54.799 --> 00:25:00.829
So we can also view the groups at this user belongs to the tags that we created.

00:25:00.829 --> 00:25:05.090
We can edit tags and the security credentials and so on and so forth.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.219
So you can delete the user here,

00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:09.740
everything you do with that user you can do here.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.439
Now, since you've done on the credentials,

00:25:12.439 --> 00:25:16.579
you can now go into you can sign out.

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:17.974
Okay.

00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:21.319
And let me actually do that for you.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:24.150
Let's go ahead and sign out.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.994
And you can click on sign in to the console.

00:25:29.994 --> 00:25:34.479
And originally we were logging in using the root user and

00:25:34.479 --> 00:25:39.040
now is by using the e-mail you use to create your account.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.789
Your original root credentials are and you would type that in here,

00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:45.610
click Next and enter your password and login.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:50.049
But we said that that's not good practice and you should definitely avoid that.

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:53.800
So we created a default or we created an admin user.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.139
And we called it a smile in my case,

00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:57.999
in your case, whatever you call it.

00:25:57.999 --> 00:26:00.594
And now we want to use that to login, right?

00:26:00.594 --> 00:26:04.239
So we're gonna click on IAM user.

00:26:04.239 --> 00:26:07.590
And here you would enter your account ID.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:12.875
So the 12 digits that I showed you that on the left side at the very bottom.

00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:17.734
However, because it's hard to remember your account ID,

00:26:17.734 --> 00:26:20.719
especially if you're dealing with a lot of different AWS accounts.

00:26:20.719 --> 00:26:25.789
Like for me, I have a separate account for all my clients.

00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:29.240
So those are a lot of account IDs to keep track of.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.754
So that's why we define the integral alias

00:26:33.754 --> 00:26:36.619
where the final account alias and we can use that to

00:26:36.619 --> 00:26:40.115
directly access the login for that account.

00:26:40.115 --> 00:26:49.889
With the alias for our account was number dash one dash AWS course.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:59.419
And now we can log in as an IAM user for the account number dash, one dash.

00:26:59.419 --> 00:27:01.609
And our username is smile.

00:27:01.609 --> 00:27:06.560
Make sure you do watch out for capital letters and for the password.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.189
You have to open up this file down here and

00:27:10.189 --> 00:27:14.000
find the auto-generated password for that user.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.169
So I've opened up that file and I've copied the other general path.

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:22.220
Now I'm going to type that into here and I'm going to sign in.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:27.154
Now it's asking me to create a new password.

00:27:27.154 --> 00:27:30.650
Remember, that's what we specified specifically,

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.270
we wanted the user creating a password,

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.265
so I'm going to copy in my old password here.

00:27:34.265 --> 00:27:39.619
So the old password is the password that you downloaded as a CSV.

00:27:39.619 --> 00:27:50.329
And then you can specify new password and confirm password change. That's loading.

00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:55.309
And now you have successfully logged in as an IAM user.

00:27:55.309 --> 00:28:00.530
And you'll see now up in the right corner you'll see smile at number one,

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.514
dash, dash, dash course.

00:28:03.514 --> 00:28:09.435
And now I'm logged in as an IAM user instead of a root user.

00:28:09.435 --> 00:28:12.084
And because I have access to everything,

00:28:12.084 --> 00:28:13.599
I shouldn't have any problems.

00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:16.120
I can go right back into IAM.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.300
And everything is exactly as we

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.240
left it now that's something very important to keep in mind.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.920
When you create IAM users.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.449
You're not creating new accounts.

00:28:25.449 --> 00:28:27.265
You're not creating a new AWS account.

00:28:27.265 --> 00:28:34.344
You're creating an access or a user that can access your account.

00:28:34.344 --> 00:28:36.355
So they're going to be logging into the same account.

00:28:36.355 --> 00:28:37.420
They just have access to

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.559
different services and different resources within those services,

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:44.184
within that account. So within your account.

00:28:44.184 --> 00:28:46.629
So now we have one user, right?

00:28:46.629 --> 00:28:49.779
Now if we wanted to create another user,

00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:51.189
we can go ahead and do that.

00:28:51.189 --> 00:28:54.754
But what we want to do is create a group.

00:28:54.754 --> 00:28:58.640
Because what's going to happen is now on if we create another user, right?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.229
And it's also an admin user,

00:29:00.229 --> 00:29:02.270
we're going to have to assign it the same policy.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.855
But later on, if you want to change something

00:29:05.855 --> 00:29:11.255
across all admin accounts or cross all admin users might.

00:29:11.255 --> 00:29:15.169
Then we're going to have to go in and do that individually.

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:16.685
So instead we can create a group.

00:29:16.685 --> 00:29:18.574
So this click on Groups.

00:29:18.574 --> 00:29:20.570
No records had been found.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.084
We can create a new group.

00:29:22.084 --> 00:29:24.274
Let's call this Group Admin.

00:29:24.274 --> 00:29:25.280
Okay?

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.720
You can call it a developer.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.089
You can create a developer group for developers,

00:29:29.089 --> 00:29:31.729
you know, whatever the case may be.

00:29:31.729 --> 00:29:34.264
But in our case, we want to create an admin group.

00:29:34.264 --> 00:29:41.885
Next step, now we can select a policy or policies to attach to that group.

00:29:41.885 --> 00:29:44.869
So since it is an admin,

00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:46.204
it's going to be an admin group.

00:29:46.204 --> 00:29:51.245
Let's just attach the same administrator access policy to it.

00:29:51.245 --> 00:29:53.375
Click Next.

00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:56.314
This is just reviewing which positive added.

00:29:56.314 --> 00:29:58.579
And then we can create a group.

00:29:58.579 --> 00:30:03.409
And now we have an admin group that has your users assigned to it.

00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:06.530
Now, when we go back into users,

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.530
by the way, if you noticed that

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.675
Now the last activity is,

00:30:11.675 --> 00:30:14.735
is marked as today because we've actually logged in.

00:30:14.735 --> 00:30:19.399
Okay, so let's click on his smile and let's go to groups.

00:30:19.399 --> 00:30:22.430
Now we can add the user to a group.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.539
And now we see this admin group that we just created.

00:30:26.539 --> 00:30:30.530
And we can add a smile to this group.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.760
Now if you had another group there,

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.059
you could have added at the same time, with the same click.

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:37.234
You could have added smarter to both r3,

00:30:37.234 --> 00:30:39.934
r3, or any number of groups at the same time.

00:30:39.934 --> 00:30:41.525
So that's very easy to manage.

00:30:41.525 --> 00:30:46.369
And now it's my belongs to the admin group and has administrator has

00:30:46.369 --> 00:30:51.844
this permission or this policy attached to him through that group.

00:30:51.844 --> 00:30:57.319
This means that we no longer need to specify specific permissions for that user.

00:30:57.319 --> 00:30:59.345
We can just remove this.

00:30:59.345 --> 00:31:01.309
You might have a user within

00:31:01.309 --> 00:31:04.234
a particular group that

00:31:04.234 --> 00:31:07.039
you need to have special privileges even though he does want to group.

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:11.210
And so you can come in here and you can assign him you

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:15.800
can assign him special permissions as well on top of whatever he gets from the group.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.400
But in our case, we don't need it because we have attachment group.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.819
We have the same policy that's attached from group,

00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:27.709
so we can just remove that directly attached policy.

00:31:27.709 --> 00:31:33.860
And we're detaching it and take some time sometimes.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.294
No worries. Let's just let that detach.

00:31:37.294 --> 00:31:41.060
And there we go. We have now the same policy,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.304
but now it's through a group.

00:31:42.304 --> 00:31:46.550
And this means that we no longer have to manage it through that user.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.140
We can just go into groups and we can

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.640
manage the permissions they have directly from, from here.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.139
We can attach any policy, one,

00:31:54.139 --> 00:31:57.169
we can remove any policy we want, so on and so forth.

00:31:57.169 --> 00:32:00.499
So, and then here we can manage the users.

00:32:00.499 --> 00:32:03.035
Remove users from the group.

00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:04.535
You can add users to the group.

00:32:04.535 --> 00:32:09.410
So you can add users directly from groups instead of going into the user himself,

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.740
go into the user's page.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.610
And here you can obviously see that now we have one user.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.820
So generally the best practice is to define

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.375
a group's first and define the permissions at those groups who have.

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:28.220
And then create users and assign them directly to groups.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.170
And as much as possible,

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:38.555
try to have your policies be attached to users through groups and not directly attached.

00:32:38.555 --> 00:32:39.680
Okay?

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.370
And then basically now you have complete control over how many users you can

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:47.525
create and how many policies you can attach in that kind of seven.

00:32:47.525 --> 00:32:52.564
And that'll pretty much be enough for most of what you need.

00:32:52.564 --> 00:32:54.050
And if you own a passage,

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.310
you can manage your policies.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.320
You can create a policy.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.749
And this, remember I mentioned in the last video that there is a visual editor.

00:33:02.749 --> 00:33:04.819
And if you wanted to,

00:33:04.819 --> 00:33:06.590
you could specify the JSON directly.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.434
You can write in, right?

00:33:08.434 --> 00:33:12.304
You can create a JSON object of the policy one,

00:33:12.304 --> 00:33:15.139
but the visual editor is generally enough for you.

00:33:15.139 --> 00:33:22.514
You can select a service that you want to give permissions to select, say, PC2.

00:33:22.514 --> 00:33:27.549
Ec2, we click on it and then the actions, you know,

00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:30.429
the different access levels on the resources

00:33:30.429 --> 00:33:33.684
from within the EC2 that you want to give access to, so on and so forth.

00:33:33.684 --> 00:33:39.219
And then you can actually create a policy and then start assigning it to people.

00:33:39.219 --> 00:33:44.019
So you can also import a managed policy and that would be done as an,

00:33:44.019 --> 00:33:45.355
as a JSON object.

00:33:45.355 --> 00:33:47.815
But again, that's a more advanced topic.

00:33:47.815 --> 00:33:51.954
Now, if we, if we go down into account settings,

00:33:51.954 --> 00:33:56.409
we can actually, we can create what's called a password policy.

00:33:56.409 --> 00:34:01.540
So it's a set of rules that define the type of password and IAM user can set.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.919
And by default, this password,

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:06.890
This uses this password policy here.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:10.130
So it requires a minimum password length of 88 characters.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.429
Include a minimum of three of the following. Has to have.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:18.845
Three of these characters must have identical to your AWS account name or email address.

00:34:18.845 --> 00:34:20.960
So you can change the policy.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.840
You can enforce, enforce any number of characters.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.890
You can require any number of options here you know, you can,

00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:29.900
you can enable password expiration,

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.599
for example, 90 days.

00:34:32.599 --> 00:34:34.909
And then you can require that to happen,

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:38.569
message or reset, prevent password reuse, so on and so forth.

00:34:38.569 --> 00:34:40.970
So you can define exactly,

00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:43.879
you know, your password policy for your users.

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:47.330
And this really adds to the security.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:51.499
And you might even have some guidelines or requirements.

00:34:51.499 --> 00:34:56.764
Pyre company, as to how your policy should we defined and you can do all of that here.

00:34:56.764 --> 00:35:03.664
Now, one last thing that I'm recovering is how to set up MFA.

00:35:03.664 --> 00:35:05.374
Now again, keep in mind,

00:35:05.374 --> 00:35:09.125
as with every other service and as I've said many times before,

00:35:09.125 --> 00:35:14.779
there's a lot going on for every service and it's just too much to cover in the course.

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:16.624
So I'm giving you, you know, what,

00:35:16.624 --> 00:35:19.159
pretty much enough for, you know,

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:21.290
everything you need for the exam obviously,

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.444
but also pretty much everything you need in practical everyday use.

00:35:25.444 --> 00:35:29.015
Um, you can go around and you can start exploring roles.

00:35:29.015 --> 00:35:31.655
Because now you know how to use,

00:35:31.655 --> 00:35:34.279
how to create users and groups and that kind of stuff.

00:35:34.279 --> 00:35:38.780
So it's pretty much the same thing with roles and learning difficulty with

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.760
rows for people just getting data VS

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.430
is in understanding the difference between role and the user.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.025
And I define that in the last video.

00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:49.684
So just go back and review that if you have troubles there and even

00:35:49.684 --> 00:35:53.420
kill a lot of information here in AWS also recognized that people have trouble with that.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.260
So it gives you a description of what it is Rosa,

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.260
secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.780
Example of entities include the following.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.529
An IAM user in another account application code running on

00:36:06.529 --> 00:36:11.089
an EC2 instance than ESA perform actions on a year with resources, so on and so forth.

00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:12.739
So, you know, everything you need is here,

00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:15.665
but essentially you create a row in the same way you create a user.

00:36:15.665 --> 00:36:19.250
And then there is something, this is a new thing called identity

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:23.029
providers and it's too high level for this course.

00:36:23.029 --> 00:36:24.229
I'm not going to go into it.

00:36:24.229 --> 00:36:28.910
And it's not required for you to continue this course on.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:31.369
But one thing that we should know how to do,

00:36:31.369 --> 00:36:34.519
and this will again be very important for security in

00:36:34.519 --> 00:36:38.840
your organization when you're creating users is setting up MFA.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:44.749
So if we click on a user and we go into security credentials, here,

00:36:44.749 --> 00:36:47.359
we have access to everything to do with in a security access,

00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:52.460
we can inactivate the access key for that user.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.649
You know, set up SSH key,

00:36:54.649 --> 00:36:57.379
access, good AP credential, so on and so forth.

00:36:57.379 --> 00:37:02.945
But specifically here we have something called Assign MFA device,

00:37:02.945 --> 00:37:05.720
status sign, so we can manage that.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.590
And we can choose the type of device to assign.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.124
And I mentioned that there are several, several options.

00:37:12.124 --> 00:37:15.995
So you can use an authenticator app and this is the one I prefer.

00:37:15.995 --> 00:37:23.735
Order actually physical devices that act as MFA devices that you can also use.

00:37:23.735 --> 00:37:27.305
But anyway, you'll click on that and you continue.

00:37:27.305 --> 00:37:30.859
Insula compatible your mobile device or computer.

00:37:30.859 --> 00:37:33.019
And you can see a list of compatible applications.

00:37:33.019 --> 00:37:37.054
I think I have one from Microsoft or Google or something.

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:41.885
And then you scan this code and then you get two different codes.

00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:44.885
You might have to wait a little bit in between them.

00:37:44.885 --> 00:37:46.909
And then this way,

00:37:46.909 --> 00:37:50.944
you establish access and connect us,

00:37:50.944 --> 00:37:56.000
establish a connection between your AOCI account and your authenticator application.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.460
And then this way you can assign your MFA,

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:06.470
you can assign MFA authentication to your multi-factor authentication to your account.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:08.060
And so every time you log in,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.350
you'll have to use your device or your app to authenticate.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:15.755
And this is as an added layer of security to your account.

00:38:15.755 --> 00:38:19.669
And so we know it's something that's highly advised and quite frankly,

00:38:19.669 --> 00:38:21.230
you should be doing it for your other accounts as well.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.640
Much state of his accounts, right?

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.099
You should do it for email accounts and so on, so forth.

00:38:25.099 --> 00:38:31.655
So that pretty much covers everything you should ever need for IAM.

00:38:31.655 --> 00:38:35.990
And so take, take some time,

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.460
play around with that mimicry.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.949
Some users query, some groups, explore,

00:38:39.949 --> 00:38:43.054
experiment, and go through some more documentation.

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:47.309
And I will see you in the next section. Bye.
