00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.930
So now that we've got a very good basic understanding of what ec2 is.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.355
And we've actually created our first EC2 instance.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.474
And we know how to walk through those steps,

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:18.330
those seven steps, and to run the instance.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.100
And we know our way around that tab, that instance tab.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.995
And we can just look at the IP address and we can view that

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:31.910
in some specific information like IP addresses, so on and so forth.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.725
The next thing we wanna do is to actually access our instance.

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:38.480
So we want to get into it.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.434
Remember, an instance is essentially just a computer.

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:47.510
Somewhere on AWS, servers are in datacenters.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.030
And so a computer is just an operating system.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.030
And because we're dealing with servers and administration,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.015
that kind of said we prefer the operating system to be Linux,

00:00:56.015 --> 00:01:00.590
and therefore will be using Linux commands and so on and so forth.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.605
And, but it's essentially just a computer running Linux.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.005
And so we want to access it.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:10.055
Maybe you want to install some software on it.

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:12.740
Maybe we want to put our application on it.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.560
Maybe we want to put up a database on it,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.800
you know, set up an API or whatever they use case may be.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.510
We want to actually access it.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.360
We want to be able to login to that computer,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.385
to that virtual, remote computer and do whatever we want with it.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.400
So for that we're gonna be using SSH,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.980
which is a secure shell access.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.750
And I'm not going to be going into too much detail because this is not a Linux course

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.270
and this is not a system at administration course. By any means.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.600
I'm expecting you to be at least familiar with what

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.155
Linux is and how to use Linux just very roughly.

00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:53.150
And to know what SSH is.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.215
If not, do go and watch them tutorials on that.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:01.160
But it shouldn't be too much of a problem as long as you follow what I'm teaching here.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.890
So we want to connect to our Linux instance using SSH.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.974
First thing you want to do is before you connect your Linux instance,

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:13.730
usually complete some prerequisite.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.865
So check your instance status.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:18.860
After you launch an instance,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.275
it can take a few minutes as you saw,

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:27.755
right when we took some time for the essence to be ready so that you can connect to it.

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:29.105
And if you remember,

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:33.140
there was a status column and it was initializing,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.570
so we can't connect to it while it's a initializing.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.780
So just make sure your instances

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.085
ready and check that your instance has passed its status checks.

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:45.680
There were two out of two status checks that had been

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.785
passed right after a few minutes and gone by.

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:52.040
And you can you can basically just refer to

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.195
the status check column in the instance's page.

00:02:56.195 --> 00:03:02.165
So once you've made sure that your instance is initialized and it's running properly.

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:06.860
Next would be to get the public DNS name and username to connect to your instance.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.375
So I showed you where you can,

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.210
you can find the public DNS name down below,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.250
where when you, when you select the instance,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.710
you see down below some details on the instance.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.290
And I showed you where you can find the public DNS name.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.615
You could also use the public IP name.

00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:25.130
But the important thing is that public and the keyword here is public.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.205
You can't use the private IP address or the private DNS name to access it because.

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:35.660
Private IP address is used only within your system,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.950
within your VPC for other services to refer

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.750
to an address and communicate with with your EC2 instance.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.975
So it's not exposed to the public.

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:51.890
And when you do expose your instance to the public,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.480
you have to use the public,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.945
the assigned public IP and the DNS names.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:01.970
So just make sure that that's a very common mistake that commerce make.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.440
The either chart use a private IP address or the use the public IP address.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.205
And then for some reason they reboot their instance.

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:14.120
And then a new public IP address is assigned and they're not

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.395
aware of that because every time you reboot or you restart an instance,

00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:24.710
a new public IP is assigned and see you allocate a Elastic IP for that instance.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.690
So they don't realize that in this,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.010
continue trying to connect using the previous public IP.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.020
And that obviously doesn't work.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.945
So after you do that,

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:40.445
go ahead and install an SSH client on your local computer as needed.

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:45.140
Now, this will be easier for some, you know, your,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.145
your local computer might have an SSH client installed by default,

00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:52.925
especially if you're using a Linux or a Mac computer,

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:57.650
I think in the latest Windows computers now to have it installed by default.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.700
And you can verify this by typing SSH at the command line.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.935
And if your computer doesn't recognize the command,

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:05.885
that means obviously it's uninstalled and,

00:05:05.885 --> 00:05:08.510
and so you should install an NSAID H client.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.530
So recent versions of Windows Server 2019 and

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.515
Windows 10 should have OpenSSH included as an installable component.

00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:24.755
And early versions of Windows allow you to download and install OpenSSH.

00:05:24.755 --> 00:05:27.845
And obviously if you have Linux and Mac,

00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:31.160
Mac OS, you can download and solve OpenSSH, you got a problem.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.635
So, um, there are other clients as well.

00:05:33.635 --> 00:05:36.185
So I'm going to lead us up to you.

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:40.880
This is so I differ so vastly between

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.040
different operating systems and different devices in

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.010
that kinda stuff that I'm not going to bother in this course.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.645
Trying to trouble, shoot every possibility and every problem that might arise.

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:54.545
Because it's not really an AWS issue.

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:56.900
In SSH, access is very important,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.230
very crucial for you to know how to access your EC2 instance.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.130
But thankfully, AWS does supply or give

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.015
us a way to access are easy to insert it directly from the browser.

00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:11.015
So for this course, I'm going to be relying on that.

00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:13.760
And I'm going to show you that in a few slides.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.585
But know that traditionally you would access

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:25.205
your EC2 instance Azure would access any other server through a client and SSH client.

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:29.450
And so it is advisable if you do have the time to just go

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.830
and figure out how to do that for

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.995
your particular operating system on your particular computer.

00:06:33.995 --> 00:06:34.745
Now.

00:06:34.745 --> 00:06:37.400
And then once you have your client installed,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.885
you can access it,

00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:43.265
access your, you can access your instance.

00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:50.060
And the key things you need to know are your path to your

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.760
Key that you downloaded when you create your instance,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.625
if you remember a dot p m phi p p m file that you downloaded,

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:02.450
this is the private key and AWS has the public key.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.005
So you're going to need this to access your instance.

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:08.555
And so you have to specify the path to it.

00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:12.320
And you need to obviously know your public instance DNS

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.089
name here and your instance username.

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:23.405
The instance username will change depending on the operating system of your incidence.

00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:27.365
For example, Ubuntu comes with a default username.

00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:30.410
Ubuntu would lowercase letters.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:39.845
The AWS Linux to server comes with a default username of EC2 dash user.

00:07:39.845 --> 00:07:42.020
And if you're using any of the other servers,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.415
you have to look that up.

00:07:43.415 --> 00:07:47.360
But there is probably something pretty standard.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.710
Um, so for example,

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.930
in our case we have a lemonade of this Linux to server.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:58.085
So you would write EC2 dash user and then your public DNS name.

00:07:58.085 --> 00:08:02.195
And then obviously, you know the command SSH I.

00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:05.704
So you type this in to your client,

00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:10.040
to your terminal, new client terminal for SSH access.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.000
And you should get our response like this.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.800
And if you don't, if there's a timeout,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.740
like if if nothing loads and

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.835
it's it looks like it's trying to access it, but nothing loads.

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:26.930
That means that you probably don't have your security groups properly installed.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.750
This means that are attached or configured.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:35.135
I mean, which means that most probably you don't have your SSH port,

00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:37.910
port 22 open for access,

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.635
or you have it open for access.

00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:44.810
But you know, you specified a certain IP and you're not accessing it through that IP.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.210
For example, maybe you specified my IP,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.640
but then your IP has changed since then,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.470
or something of that sort.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.190
So generally if, if it just keeps trying to connect but nothing loads,

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.490
go and check your security groups and make sure that you have

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.625
the proper ports configured properly.

00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:04.280
Um, and so if you do see this, then congrats,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:10.820
That means that your port 22 is open and you're able to access it and just enter. Yes.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.905
And then you should get something like this.

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:15.095
And now you're connected. Okay?

00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:17.210
So it's not that complicated.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.940
I'm just a couple of things that you should

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.510
make sure you don't forget your public DNS name.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:28.070
Just go back into your instance in AWS on the console, right?

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.580
And just make sure that you have the correct public DNS name.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.635
Make sure your username is correct.

00:09:33.635 --> 00:09:35.300
Make sure that you're using

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.040
the correct private key file and that you've specified the path correctly.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.905
And then it should be fine.

00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:46.580
There, there are some problems that might come up,

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.170
especially when you're dealing with windows,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.090
but they're all pretty well-documented,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.395
just searched on Google.

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:53.195
You should be able to find an answer.

00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:57.860
Now if you do receive an error while attempting to connect to your instance,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.840
you can search for troubleshooting,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.470
connecting to your instance AWS Docs or something like that into Google.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.490
And you should be able to find

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:10.985
a nice documentation page clearly explaining all the possibilities for your problem.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.355
However, for our case.

00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:18.065
And most probably for most of you are use cases as well.

00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:22.460
An EC2 instance Connect should be enough.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:27.410
So now we're not going to be dealing with SSH clients and all of that.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.020
Because if I, if I were to use

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.715
an SSH client to connect to my instance for you in the tutorial in this course.

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:37.160
It's not going to be directly applicable to your case,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.660
is going to be easily reproducible.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.040
You, you might have

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.235
a different operating system or a different version of the same operating system.

00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:46.640
Or you might even just have a different version of the SSH client.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.950
Like there are so many ways that it can go wrong.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:55.249
And since the focus of this course is not just general Linux remote access,

00:10:55.249 --> 00:10:57.845
but rather it's AWS.

00:10:57.845 --> 00:11:01.264
I'm going to try to stay within the confines of AWS.

00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:05.060
So I'm going to be using this feature that's very pleasantly

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.950
available in AWS called EC2 instance connect.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:16.970
And this basically allows you to connect to your instances in a simple and secure way.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.665
And you can do this directly from your browser without having to download anything.

00:11:21.665 --> 00:11:23.225
And which is very useful.

00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:28.460
So instance connect handles the permissions and provides a successful connection.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.330
So because you're connecting directly from the browser window and directly from

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.190
your instance instances page in a enumerated AWS console.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:44.975
Aws already knows the public DNS and it already has the keys.

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.830
So there isn't anything you really need to do.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.970
You just connect, as long as you know the username of your instance,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.605
you can very easily connect to your instance and it saves a lot of hassle.

00:11:57.605 --> 00:12:02.000
Now, there are a couple of things you need to make sure of.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.590
The instance that you're running should have one of these two Linux distributions.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.640
So as of now these are the two that are support instance connect.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.485
By the time you're watching this video.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:19.880
Some other versions might also adopt support, for instance,

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.755
connect, but for all intents and purposes, right?

00:12:24.755 --> 00:12:27.350
We're not going to really need ever to use

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.530
another type of incidence unless you're doing something very specific.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.955
You know, maybe your.net programmers are like that, but you're,

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:38.285
you're either going to be using Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu

00:12:38.285 --> 00:12:42.290
and hopefully something that's 16.04 or later.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.810
So you shouldn't have any problem connecting,

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.220
but just make sure that you know,

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.590
that you're not trying to connect with instance,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.660
connect to another type of instance.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.295
Another thing to make sure of is that port 22 is open.

00:12:55.295 --> 00:12:57.604
Now this does seem so simple.

00:12:57.604 --> 00:12:59.150
It does go without saying,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.330
but unfortunately, a lot of people do make this mistake.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.610
They tried desperately to connect to the instance and they troubleshoot everything.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.430
And then they find out that their port,

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.220
the SSH port is closed or doesn't have

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.300
the proper configuration to allow for their IP address.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:23.225
So always make sure that port 22 is open and you can't connect to an instance through,

00:13:23.225 --> 00:13:26.405
through instance connect without portraying to being opened.

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:30.545
And that is because instance Connect is essentially an SSH connection.

00:13:30.545 --> 00:13:32.345
It's, it is an SSH connection.

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:36.215
And so that's probably the cause of the confusion.

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:40.155
People who are not familiar with Linux and not familiar with SSH.

00:13:40.155 --> 00:13:42.415
Just haven't spoiled by,

00:13:42.415 --> 00:13:44.755
by the fact that instance connecting exists.

00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:49.015
So they've never had to learn what SSH is and what port 22 is.

00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:52.000
And so they didn't make that connection, right?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.950
That they need to have port 20 to open up the probably thinking,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.965
you know, I'm, I'm here in the browser.

00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:01.660
I can see my instance here.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.890
The details have an AWS.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.285
Why can't I just connect to it?

00:14:04.285 --> 00:14:07.225
You know, but don't forget your instance is

00:14:07.225 --> 00:14:12.385
a virtual computer in the Cloud somewhere far away.

00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:15.729
And it has its own credentials and has its own security.

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:20.935
And so you need to follow those steps to be able to access it,

00:14:20.935 --> 00:14:25.495
even if you're accessing it through the browser within the same AWS console that,

00:14:25.495 --> 00:14:30.250
that you're, the details over your EC2 instance lie.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:34.705
You're going to slap to use SSH to access it, right?

00:14:34.705 --> 00:14:42.714
So don't forget about that and make sure that the instance has a public IP, IPv4 address.

00:14:42.714 --> 00:14:49.315
And your EC2, EC2 instance Connect does not support connecting using IPV6 address.

00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:51.280
But that's not a problem because we're not going to be dealing

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.560
with IPV6 addresses anyway.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.980
But just, you know, it's worth I mentioned.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.100
So now let's jump straight into our AWS console and

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.265
get some hands-on practice connecting to our EC2 instance.

00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:09.050
Again, we're not going to be using an SSH client downloaded onto our computer,

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.815
but we're going to be using the instance connect feature,

00:15:12.815 --> 00:15:16.475
which is a browser-based SSH client.

00:15:16.475 --> 00:15:20.255
So here we are exactly where we left off in the last video.

00:15:20.255 --> 00:15:22.235
We have our instance.

00:15:22.235 --> 00:15:23.690
It's still up and running.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:29.120
And remember, we have to check to make sure that it's past its status checks.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.770
So two other two checks past.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:31.760
So this is up and running.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.720
This is now ready to be connected to we.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:41.375
We do have port 22 open inbound as an inbound rule,

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:43.340
and it's allowing all IP addresses.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.465
So that's okay.

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:49.475
And if we go into here we have, okay, Let's refresh.

00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:51.710
Let's click on our instance again.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:56.915
And we do have a public DNS.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:00.650
So if you did download and SSH client,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.935
this is what you would use using the command I gave you,

00:16:03.935 --> 00:16:11.390
the SSH command and using the location of your private key as well as the username.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:16.115
So in our case, the username for this instance is EC2.

00:16:16.115 --> 00:16:24.470
I can write it here for your EC2 dash user because it is a Linux OS, Linux to instance.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.490
So the way we're going to connect to this is by using connect here.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.065
That, that's how simple it is.

00:16:30.065 --> 00:16:33.185
And this is the instance connect feature.

00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:34.865
We click on it.

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:39.800
And here there are some other options, right?

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.610
But we're concerned with EC2 instance connect.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.110
And it's confirming that it's our distances we want to connect to,

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.820
and this is its public IP address.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.450
So this is what this browser-based client,

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.150
which is easy EC2 instance Connect,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.370
will use to connect to the.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.450
The instance because remember we need to use a public IP address.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.925
We can connect remotely to anything using its private,

00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:11.075
private IP address because that private IP is only

00:17:11.075 --> 00:17:15.185
used within that private network and we don't have access to that private network.

00:17:15.185 --> 00:17:18.140
In our case, that private network is our VPC.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:23.840
So the usernames EC2, ec2 user.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.660
And we connect.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.145
And hopefully if our port is open and everything is correct,

00:17:31.145 --> 00:17:33.950
we should be able to login.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:38.705
And there we go. We are now within our instance.

00:17:38.705 --> 00:17:40.325
This is our instance.

00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:49.820
We can do a simple man cd and just any Linux command and just to show that it's working.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.215
And we're here, we're in our instance.

00:17:54.215 --> 00:18:00.425
And you can see that we have the user, EC2, dash user.

00:18:00.425 --> 00:18:02.960
But then for IP here,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.050
this IP doesn't look like our public IP, right?

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.570
If we go back into instances,

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:13.610
are public IP address starts with two and that's such that 172, why?

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.620
Because that is actually the private IP address.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.560
So we're confirming that that is

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:26.150
the private IP address of, of our instance.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.950
So this means that we're in right,

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.920
we have access to the internal network so you can do

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.280
Control L to clear everything that's there.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.965
So if we do, IF Config a,

00:18:36.965 --> 00:18:44.840
we can see that the 0 is set the private ID.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.505
So, and by the way,

00:18:46.505 --> 00:18:48.230
so now we're in the next,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.340
again, this is not in the next course,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.710
but you should, you should know some simple commands.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:57.065
So if you have any, if you ever need to look something up like IF Config,

00:18:57.065 --> 00:18:59.420
you can just write help.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.034
And this is the pipe operator.

00:19:03.034 --> 00:19:07.160
And then just pipe it into the function more so you

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.690
can get some information on what that function is and how to use it.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.410
More that command, I mean that gets usage and some descriptions of it.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.180
If you want a more detailed set of description for artists,

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.890
pull up the manual pages for that.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.440
For that command, you can use man.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.340
So if config, and here,

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.990
IF config, it says configure a Network Interface.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:39.395
It poses in from the Linux system administrator's manual.

00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:42.950
And these are just some quick ways to use it.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:48.785
And note, it says this program is absolutely for replacement, check IP add,

00:19:48.785 --> 00:19:56.060
adder or a link for statistics named Afghanistan, so etc.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.620
So like anything you want to know about this command basically description options.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.765
We use the dash options or display

00:20:02.765 --> 00:20:06.155
all interfaces which are currently available even if down.

00:20:06.155 --> 00:20:12.200
And you can use j to scroll down.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:18.605
And then you can press Q to just exit out completely and then Control L to clear this,

00:20:18.605 --> 00:20:20.945
to clear the screen again. So.

00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:23.870
These are just some basic Linux commands.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.110
Now we will be coming back into the instance in

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.400
the next video where I'll show you how to install some stuff,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.740
some software that you might need like Docker or

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.995
good or an Apache server, that kind of stuff.

00:20:36.995 --> 00:20:40.910
But for now, we don't really need to do anything here.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.270
So we've successfully, successfully access the instance,

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.890
which is very good.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.260
And we can just exit.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.305
And that logs you out and you can just close this tab.

00:20:51.305 --> 00:20:54.275
Now, I want to show you a couple of things.

00:20:54.275 --> 00:20:58.610
First of all, if we were to go into security

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:05.710
and if we were to remove this security group,

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.140
now, again, we haven't gotten to security groups yet,

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.760
but if we added inbound rules and we just delete these and we save,

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.370
okay, um, don't worry, I'm going to be going into

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.940
the details of security groups in the following videos.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.500
But for now, if we go back into our easy to instances, by the way,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.585
after we create the instance,

00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:27.190
if you were to come back in a dashboard,

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.830
you would see that we have one instance that's running.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:34.045
We slap not allocate Elastic IP because that's not done automatically.

00:21:34.045 --> 00:21:35.200
When you create an instance,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.840
you have to do that yourself if you want to.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.925
But we have a key pair.

00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:41.485
Remember, because we downloaded it.

00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:44.605
And you can actually click here and you can see the name.

00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:49.620
Remember we gave it the name my dash first, first instance.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.410
And then we have now two security groups.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.545
Because now one was created for this instance,

00:21:57.545 --> 00:22:00.470
and we have obviously an instance.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:05.479
So let's go back into instances and we click on our instance.

00:22:05.479 --> 00:22:07.640
And now if we go into security,

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.110
we see that we have no inbound rules, no inbound rules.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.675
So that means a port 22 is closed.

00:22:14.675 --> 00:22:19.309
This means that if we try to connect to our instance,

00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:20.960
it's going to keep trying to connect,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.660
but it's not going to show anything and eventually it'll timeout.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.950
So this is a timeout.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.385
If you're using a, if you're using SSH client,

00:22:28.385 --> 00:22:32.255
then you can get some other form of timeout screen.

00:22:32.255 --> 00:22:34.190
But that basically means most probably

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.230
that you have a problem with their security groups.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:42.060
You should go back in and make sure that you have port 22 enabled.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:51.680
You should make sure that you have port 22 enabled for your instance, okay?

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.400
Now another important thing to keep in mind is that

00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:01.595
this public IP address will change depending on.

00:23:01.595 --> 00:23:04.190
So this is temporary, right?

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.795
So Let's make a note of this, right?

00:23:08.795 --> 00:23:11.210
Let me copy this, okay?

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:20.435
And let me reboot my instance, okay?

00:23:20.435 --> 00:23:23.150
So if you come in,

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.165
if you select your instance and you click on Instance State.

00:23:26.165 --> 00:23:29.225
So we, so far we've used Connect.

00:23:29.225 --> 00:23:31.160
And this is just the refresh button.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.660
And we've used launch instances.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.595
We haven't used actions yet.

00:23:34.595 --> 00:23:36.680
But basically connect.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.250
Is there.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.770
Other stuff we'll be using later on is all there,

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:48.515
but we want to change the instance state.

00:23:48.515 --> 00:23:51.320
We can terminate it, but then we can never recover

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.870
that in some instances will have to create a new one.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:58.100
And I'm going to be going over this instance lifecycle video.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.245
But we can stop it or,

00:24:00.245 --> 00:24:03.020
and started again, or we can just reboot instance.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.360
So let's reboot it.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.800
Okay?

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.970
Now this refresh button is pretty important because keep in mind

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:15.515
that the actions that you're doing right in,

00:24:15.515 --> 00:24:17.180
in your ADFS console,

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.175
in your dashboard when you click on something,

00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:22.715
this is affecting physical hardware, right?

00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:25.505
When you create, when you launch an instance rate,

00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:28.040
something physically is being created, right?

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.750
As being allocated for you.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.700
Likewise, when you terminate it, right?

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.385
An actual computers being shut down, right?

00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:37.400
So it's not always easy for ALS.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.635
You're automatically update everything,

00:24:39.635 --> 00:24:42.245
current state of everything on your screen.

00:24:42.245 --> 00:24:46.700
So you will need to use a refresh button to make sure

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:52.370
that everything is up-to-date and does reflect the current state of everything.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:57.590
So now let's wait a little longer.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.735
Or in fact, in order to just make this more guaranteed.

00:25:02.735 --> 00:25:05.690
For me to show you what I mean by there being

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.215
some latency in terms of updating the information,

00:25:09.215 --> 00:25:11.330
let's just go ahead and stop the instance.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.095
Okay?

00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:15.499
Now be careful don't terminate it because if you do terminated,

00:25:15.499 --> 00:25:18.740
you can restart the instance, it's gone.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.070
Okay, so now we've stopped it.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.765
But if we refresh and we remove this filter,

00:25:25.765 --> 00:25:28.910
will see that the instance state is still stopping.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.545
It hasn't stopped yet.

00:25:30.545 --> 00:25:33.020
It has not stopped as of yet.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.125
And it still has its IP address.

00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:37.580
Now.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.320
We have to refresh it again.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.925
And there we go. See it.

00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:42.335
It has stopped now.

00:25:42.335 --> 00:25:44.600
So now that it stopped,

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.520
all its public IP addresses,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.610
DNS, DNS addresses have been stripped.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:55.565
And it no longer has any public IP address or any public DNS address.

00:25:55.565 --> 00:25:59.600
And therefore, it's not saved anywhere either.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.114
So now if we were to restart this same instance,

00:26:04.114 --> 00:26:05.570
the very same instance, right,

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.640
the same ID, the same name.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.000
I named it my first instance and it's pending.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.210
Let's refresh. You know,

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.520
it's still pending. And there we go.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.070
It's running, but now it has initialized.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.110
But if we click on it, even though it's still initializing,

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:28.205
we do have a new public IP address and new DNS.

00:26:28.205 --> 00:26:33.830
Dns. So this is what I wanted to show you guys.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.255
That when you do restart or reboot your instance,

00:26:38.255 --> 00:26:40.415
or you shut it down and you start it back up,

00:26:40.415 --> 00:26:42.830
you will get a new public IP address.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:48.095
Remember our old public IP address was this 52.15,

00:26:48.095 --> 00:26:53.420
168, 0.32, and the new one is 18.2 to 19.77.81.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.105
So that's very important.

00:26:56.105 --> 00:26:59.930
This means that if you're using an SSH client

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:04.340
and you have your login credentials saved as this IP address.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.630
And then all of a sudden, you can no longer access your instance.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.865
And it's just timing out.

00:27:10.865 --> 00:27:12.770
What's wrong.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:17.330
Maybe if you do have port 22 open,

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:22.100
maybe or public IP address has changed because you've rebooted your instance.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.245
So that's something you gotta keep in mind.

00:27:24.245 --> 00:27:30.230
And now when we go into launch instances are not my bad.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.210
When we go into Connect.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:39.530
Aws is smart enough that it updates the IP address because it knows, right?

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.650
They're the ones that gave you the new IP address in the first place.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.260
But you have to also make sure on your end,

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:52.550
when you're using another browser-based or non AWS based as such kind.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.575
But you're also updating the IP address.

00:27:54.575 --> 00:27:57.890
So now we can connect with this new IP address.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:04.865
And obviously we can't connect because we do not have port 22 open.

00:28:04.865 --> 00:28:07.715
So we can just go to a security group very quickly.

00:28:07.715 --> 00:28:10.130
And again, I want to show you how to do this.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.685
And we go into SSH.

00:28:13.685 --> 00:28:20.720
And we want anywhere save rule.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:27.905
And now we should be able to retry. And there we go.

00:28:27.905 --> 00:28:29.419
We have access.

00:28:29.419 --> 00:28:34.985
And this is the new updated public DNS that is used.

00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:39.664
And we still have the same private IP,

00:28:39.664 --> 00:28:42.470
which is never changes and

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.920
unless we terminate the instance completely and deleted, right?

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:52.729
So that's how you connect your tier EC2 instance.

00:28:52.729 --> 00:28:57.350
Using instance, instance connect from here.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:02.495
And now that you know how to access your EC2 instance, in the next video,

00:29:02.495 --> 00:29:06.710
I'm going to be showing you how to actually download and install important programs and

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:11.720
software on your EC2 instance that you might want to use later on,

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.220
such as Docker AND gate and an Apache server.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.140
I'll see you in the next video.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.380
Bye.
