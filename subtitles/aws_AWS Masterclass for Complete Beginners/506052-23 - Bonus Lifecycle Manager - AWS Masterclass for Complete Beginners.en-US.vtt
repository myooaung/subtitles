00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.990
Hello and welcome to this quick bonus video on what is known as the Lifecycle Manager.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.650
This is actually not a very known feature,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.240
so I just want to give you guys a really quick introduction into how to use it.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.385
Into using it. Because as you've noticed,

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:23.300
a lot of this work with creating snapshots and volumes and so on, so forth.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.440
A lot of manual work and a lot of repetitive work, right?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.480
So you can, you can automate the snapshot creation using Lifecycle Manager.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.525
So you can use it to automate the creation, retention,

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:38.900
and deletion of EBS snapshots as well as EBS

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.620
backed AMI is but currently talking about snapshots.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.800
And when you automate snapshot, an AMI management,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.735
it helps you to protect valuable data by enforcing or regular backup schedule.

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:57.350
And it helps you create standardized AMIs.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.530
I can be refreshed at regular intervals and it helps you

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.430
retain backups as required by auditors are internal compliance.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.239
It helps you reduce storage costs by deleting outdated backups.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:11.810
It helps you create disaster recovery backup policies that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.680
backup data to isolate an accounts, so on, so forth.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.670
So when combined with the monitoring features of services like

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.035
Amazon CloudWatch Events and Amazon CloudTrail.

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:27.350
Lifecycle Manager provides a complete backup solution for

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.600
Amazon EC2 instances and individual EBS volumes at no additional cost.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.385
So this is definitely very useful little feature here.

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:41.700
So we can go ahead and create a lifecycle policy.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.060
And within this policy we can determine,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.080
you know, what we're creating a policy for.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.050
So essentially, for this one we just created for an Amazon EBS snapshot policy.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.225
So for Snapshots, not for am I,

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:01.295
not from Amazon machine images.

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:04.610
And then we can select a volume or the instance.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.565
And then we can define tags.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:12.350
Am I roles?

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.500
And then here we can define a schedule.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.720
So like for example,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.815
backup schedule or something, right?

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:30.670
And then we can set the frequency hours when it should start, the retention type.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.795
And and how many snapshots to keep.

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:43.225
Like after, after, how many numbers should it start deleting previous versions,

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:45.025
and so on and so forth.

00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:48.280
So there's a lot of customer miscibility that you can,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.555
you can do here, you can add additional schedules and so on and so forth.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:54.670
And then you just create your policy and that's it.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.005
And now you have a regular update happening.

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:03.340
Regular backup taking place using snapshots,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.530
snapshots that we're already familiar with.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.570
And it just happens automatically.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.615
So, and that's just a very cool little feature.

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:16.100
Very useful, but just hiding, hiding there.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.795
And it's own little place.

00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:22.040
So I just want to give you some exposure to it.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.230
Thank you, and I'll see you next video.
