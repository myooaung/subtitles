00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.129
Welcome to the last video in this section.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.860
This will be just a really quick section.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.390
And I will introduce you to a concept called instance metadata.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.595
And this is actually more to do with EC2 than anything else.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:22.590
I'm just going to show you how to access it through an EC2 instance.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.670
So this is metadata is data

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.985
about your instance that you can use to configure and manage the running instance, okay?

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:32.810
It's divided into categories.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.700
So for example, hostname events, security groups.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.170
To view all the categories of instance metadata from within a running instance,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.615
you will use the following URI.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:48.155
So this is the URI here, 169,

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:54.035
0.254.169.284 slash latest slash metadata.

00:00:54.035 --> 00:01:01.490
Now this IP address is a link local address and it's only valid from the instance.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.455
So you can put this into the browser and expect to see anything.

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.980
You have to do this from within the instance itself.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.085
So let me just show you that very quickly.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:15.320
So I've created a new instance here.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.380
Since we terminate the last one, let's connect to it.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.620
And essentially we can just curl that URI.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.150
And we can see all the different categories.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.535
So we have AI MID instance ID,

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:47.270
Network, Security Group, so on and so forth.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.830
So essentially if there's a slash,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.420
it means there's more to it.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.760
And if it's not, you can just if there isn't,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.890
you can just read it directly.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.105
So, you know, let's say that we wanted to go into instance ID, okay?

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:09.620
So then we just Instance housed spelled a dash ID.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.755
And we can see the instance ID right here.

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:13.940
Okay?

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.555
So we like, so we can access

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:23.150
basically anything to do with the instance, any of the metadata.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.030
So if we just go into latest,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.300
you can see those dynamic and as metadata and there's user data.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.935
So user data is, remember,

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:38.000
that was the code that we would specify when we're larger than sense,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.310
which would basically be like a sequence of commands that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.560
would be run when essences first launched.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.945
And that would be to configure the instance for us.

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:47.870
Like to install anything you want to install and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.810
get everything configured before we start using it.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.750
So you can explore this, right?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.115
So like you can go into the metadata and user data and you can just see different things.

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:03.920
If we had a role attached to this, you'll be able to see it.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.990
And you can see the network basically going to access anything to do with the instance.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.750
From here, all the metadata about the incidence.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.740
And that's very useful when you want to start automating things and started writing

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.375
scripts that just directly utilize some of this information.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.610
And so you don't have to do it by hand, right?

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.245
So it will adapt to it.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.805
If the IP address changes.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:27.810
You just have this, yeah,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.150
you just have this inside the script and so it will just pull it in dynamically.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.560
And if there's any other changes,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.390
the script would also change, so on, so forth.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.165
So that's just a real quick introduction to use EC2 metadata,

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:43.400
instance metadata and not to be mixed with the userData.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.785
Remember user data with something else that we learned about.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:47.885
And yeah, so with that,

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:49.775
let's conclude this section.

00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:53.300
And I will see you in the upcoming section.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.320
Thanks.
