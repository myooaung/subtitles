00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.035
So in this section we're going to be learning about Amazon S3,

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:11.925
also called Amazon Simple Storage Service.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:17.175
And this is quite an important topic.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.280
A lot of people don't really realize how useful as

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.010
three years when people think of data storage.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.900
They generally think of databases and I kind of stuff.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.439
Um, S3 is so easy to use and so practical that it's used on lots of application.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:38.090
A lot of websites can actually create websites using Amazon S3,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.980
as we're gonna see later on in this section.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.545
So don't let the simplicity fool you.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:46.190
It is called a simple storage service,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.310
but it is actually pretty simple,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.954
but that doesn't take from its importance.

00:00:52.954 --> 00:00:56.270
So what is Amazon S3?

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.980
Amazon S3 is a simple Web Services interface you can use to

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.110
store and retrieve any amount of data at anytime from anywhere on the web.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.655
And that's basically where its simplicity comes from, right?

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:16.670
In only to log in or have database credentials or have to query or

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.500
have to use another kind of

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.550
client-side program for reaching the data or anything like that.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.320
It's just very simple.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.210
Any amount of data, no limits at anytime, anywhere on the web.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.175
And that's what makes it really simple.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:35.239
And it is one of the building blocks of AWS,

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:37.070
one of the fundamental services,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.790
one of the core services along with EC2.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.095
So it's very important and it offers industry-leading scalability,

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:52.325
data availability, security performance.

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:53.795
What have you?

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:59.720
And some of the use cases are websites, mobile applications,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.675
backup and restoration from archiving enterprise applications,

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:08.015
Internet of Things devices,

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:11.870
big data analytics, so on and so forth.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.900
So it has a lot of use cases.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.720
Amazon S3 is intentionally built with

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.065
a minimum feature set that focuses on simplicity and robustness.

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:33.170
So I'm going to list for you some of the advantages of using Amazon S3. Creating buckets.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.040
You can create a name of bucket that stores data.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.860
Okay? It's literally just a bucket, okay,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.235
that stores data in buckets are essentially like

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:47.435
the fundamental containers in Amazon S3 for data storage.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:51.305
Now you can store an infinite amount of data in a bucket.

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:56.150
You can upload as many objects as you'd like into an Amazon S3 bucket.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.950
Each object can contain up to five terabytes of data.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.845
And each object is stored and retrieved using a unique developer assigned key.

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:08.910
Okay?

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.710
Now you can download your data.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.780
And enable others to do so.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.080
Donald, you there anytime you like or allow others to do the same.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.240
So you can set permissions,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.910
you can block people from accessing your data.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.230
You can do all of that.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.140
But essentially, once you allow it,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.090
it's very easy for people just use the link and just access your data.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.400
You can grant or deny access to others who want to upload data into Amazon S3 bucket.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.910
You can grant upload and download down permissions to three types of users.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.355
Authentication mechanisms can also help keep the data secure from unauthorized access.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:54.050
Okay?

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.420
And S3 buckets use standards-based rest

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.880
and soap interfaces designed to work with any inter development toolkit.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.215
Now.

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:09.815
So supported over HTTP is depreciated,

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.860
but it is still available over HTTPS.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.790
New Amazon S3 features will not be supported for so.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.595
So we recommend that you use either the rest API or the AWS SDKs.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.440
Now, let's go over

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.475
some Amazon S3 concepts that we should become familiar with before we dive.

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:34.925
And so the number one concept,

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:39.200
the most important thing to know about Amazon S3 are the buckets.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.345
Bucket is essentially a container for objects stored in S3.

00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:48.950
Every object is contained in a bucket.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.215
For example, if you have an object named photos,

00:04:54.215 --> 00:04:59.225
sludge popular JPEG, and this would be an image, a JPEG image.

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:06.620
And it's stored in a bucket called AWS example bucket one in region US West Oregon,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.065
let's say then the,

00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:12.455
it will be addressable using this URL here.

00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:13.520
Okay?

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.070
That will be the bucket name, and then the,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.160
the region, and then the name of the object itself.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.510
Now, buckets serve several purposes.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.355
They're organized Amazon S3 namespace at the highest level.

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:39.980
They identify the account responsible for storage and data transfer charges.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.730
They play a role in access control

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.200
and they serve as the unit of our aggregation for usage reporting.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.805
You can configure bucket so they're created in a specific AWS region.

00:05:55.805 --> 00:06:00.350
And you can also configure a bucket so that every time an object is added to it,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.420
Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID and assigns it to the object.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.740
Now, S3, buckets must have a globally unique name.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.850
So this name here must be globally unique.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:23.735
S3 bucket name convention includes no uppercase, no underscores.

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:26.555
And it cannot be an IP.

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:32.105
It must start with a lowercase letter or a number,

00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:37.625
and it must be between 363 characters long.

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:40.700
That's how you would name a bucket.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.050
Okay.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.200
So even though the names are globally unique,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.380
S3 is a region specific service.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:57.335
Now, another concept we should be familiar with when talking about Amazon S3.

00:06:57.335 --> 00:06:59.405
As objects.

00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:08.555
Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3 and they can consist of,

00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:12.200
or they do consists of object data and metadata.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.375
And the data portion is opaque to Amazon S3.

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:22.355
The metadata is a set of name value pairs that describe the object.

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:25.730
These include some default metadata,

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.115
such as the date last modified,

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.590
the standard HTTP metadata,

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.305
such as content, type, et cetera.

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:38.450
You can also specify custom metadata at the time the object is stored.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:45.275
An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by key name and a version ID.

00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:51.785
Now, objects for S3 can be up to five terabytes in size, like we said.

00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:53.975
And the name.

00:07:53.975 --> 00:07:57.575
And like if you do have,

00:07:57.575 --> 00:08:02.390
but the thing is you can only upload up to 50 gigabytes at a time.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.750
So if you do have an object that's larger than five gigabytes,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.225
you will need to do a multi-part upload.

00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:12.140
Now there are some other key terms when it

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.400
comes to objects that we'll be going over later on.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.405
The key name is a name you assigned to an object.

00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:25.040
The version ID is a string that Amazon S3 generates when you add an object to

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.960
a bucket and is uniquely and uniquely identifies an object.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.400
Value is the content you are storing.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.205
Metadata is a list of text key and value pairs which you can store information.

00:08:40.205 --> 00:08:43.009
And with regarding the object.

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:46.190
There are some resources which Amazon S3

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.240
uses to store objects specific additional information.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.730
And we have access control information.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.955
You can control access to the objects are stored as three.

00:08:55.955 --> 00:09:00.290
But all of these we'll cover in later slides.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:06.320
Now another important concept is what's known as keys.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.490
So a key is a unique identifier for an object within a bucket.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.890
Each object in a bucket has exactly one key.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:21.965
And the combination of a bucket key and version ID uniquely identify each object.

00:09:21.965 --> 00:09:26.780
So you can think about ministry as a basic data map between bucket,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:32.420
key version and the object itself.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.290
Okay, every object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.490
addressed through the combination of the web service endpoint,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.540
bucket name, key, and optionally aversion.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.245
And I'll show you how to do versioning with S3 as well.

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:52.430
So for example, in this URL,

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.430
doc is the name of the bucket.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.950
And 2006 dash three,

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:03.260
dash one sludge, Amazon S3 dot WSDL is the key.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.370
Okay?

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.070
And don't let this slash fool you.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.755
This flash is actually part of the key.

00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:14.195
You know, there are such things as directories in S3.

00:10:14.195 --> 00:10:21.470
But using the slash can help you mimic a directory structure regions.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.580
So you can choose a geographical AWS region,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.015
where AWS will store the buckets that you create.

00:10:29.015 --> 00:10:32.810
You might choose a region to optimize latency,

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.880
minimize costs, or address regulatory, regulatory requirements.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.085
These might be some of the factors behind your decision for which regions use.

00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:45.800
Objects stored in region never leave the region

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.950
unless you explicitly transfer them to another region.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:55.145
For example, objects stored in the Europe or Ireland region never leave it.

00:10:55.145 --> 00:10:59.030
You can only access Amazon S3 and its features in

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.765
AWS regions that are enabled for your account.

00:11:02.765 --> 00:11:09.455
Okay, So this was meant as an introduction to S3.

00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:14.240
So let's just jump right in and start playing around

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.679
with S3 and look at how we can create buckets and objects,

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:19.775
so on and so forth.

00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:22.030
Really the best way to learn.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.710
So I'll see you in the AWS console.
