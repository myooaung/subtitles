00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
before going forward with the deployment process.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.710
For our custom skill,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.450
I would like to do some quick fixes.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:19.840
So I added several logging state months in different,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.430
different methods for,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.790
ah,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:33.560
for the messages to be properly displayed and know exactly the moment when the business

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.450
logic for each corresponding intent has finished.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.880
And also here I would like to return the list off books that are mapped toe specific

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.450
authority,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.730
not the entire list collection off the books from the database.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.310
So in order to do this,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.600
I implement that the corresponding method under the repository,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:09.000
the book repository and we can invoke it with book repository find by auto and brought by

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850
the water as a part of matter.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:30.730
Now the application of it's ready and we can start it with a few seconds for the server to

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.880
start up on.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.850
Let's go once again toe the who have the most and open the but from the dialogue float.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.150
Let's do some quick tests,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:00.650
so I would like toa least the the authors,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.390
based on the response,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.100
will choose,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.250
Leo told story,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.310
and we should extract Onley his corresponding books.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.950
So this has been fixed,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:23.650
and let's select war in peace and you can see though specific book details.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.450
Now it works up as it should
