00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
Now it's timeto build a business logic for handling the list actions intent.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.130
So under action service,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:17.250
the first thing is to extend the dire look slow app.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.640
This comes directly from the Maven dependency for action song.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.830
Go,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.150
go!

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.850
Let's add the logger for logging purposes.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.660
Okay,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.250
action service that class.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:48.850
Now it's time to create our new method that's annotated with four intent,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.040
and we respond to intense that come from,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.440
ah,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.850
list actions.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360
This will return,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.790
Ah,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.350
action response.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.400
What's called a method?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.550
The list actions and we receive on actually Cuesta's Perimeter.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.450
Let's lager descriptive message.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.650
I don't know that whenever the section will be invoked,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.250
these air will see Ah corresponding message.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.400
I am less great those simple string builder new string builder.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.860
And for this intent for this business logic,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:53.090
I will not implement any Francie coat just informed the user what action So are currently

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.550
build.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.750
So this is just ah,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.780
informal message,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.010
simple message.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.450
And now we need to build a response back and said it to the user.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:22.300
So we'll create once again the response builder based on the previous response.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:31.450
So get the response builder request and add the response to string.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.480
And now we need to create the action response based on the previous response.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.950
Builder.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.750
Okay.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.450
And just turned the actual response.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.270
Okay,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.750
simple stuff over here.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.070
I think this Ah,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.310
this should work.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.080
Now.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.310
Let's go under action,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.150
Controller.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.750
And you can see that we have the action service already injected.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.430
We need toe.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:27.200
Add the intent to Till distractions speech case and invoked this time and the action

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.880
service.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.520
So instead,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.730
off the author service will go with the action service,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.350
so action service will be ableto handle this list actions,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.050
business logic.
