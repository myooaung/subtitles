00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
Hi there.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome to my course.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.250
Under the Parliament sections were built together,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.050
your forced Google assistant job based application in the form off a book management app.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.180
There are some specific operations that will implement,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.350
such as get least off existing alters.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.650
Get books written by a specific alter.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:34.120
The three book details based on book title Get the stuff books for a specific genre and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.450
last but not least,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.370
will be the user friendly,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.450
helpful support between the Google assistant and the user,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.550
such as.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.740
We can ask our personal device what operations he can currently facilitate for our book

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.750
management app.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.350
In order to see some wind pieces in action,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.550
we can review the simple process off interacting with the Google assistant by retrieving

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.750
all novel books from the book management collection and also hit the book details.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.450
The first step in our configuration process is to set up on actions on Google Project.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.440
On the right side of the screen,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.830
you can see that I have defined a project called Book Management unimportant.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.620
Aspect to know is that we have to create a set off actions for our project authority of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.560
this process.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.890
We need to navigate with their low flow.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.530
The natural language processing platform as actions on Google is built on the support or

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050
hold by this environment.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.050
And then I looked low,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.550
reconfigure several intense.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.450
An intent can be seen as an operation that we want our Google assistant device to executor

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.450
.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.350
He defined several actions,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.350
each one of them with its corresponding requirements.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.350
We have configured a gel a project by using the support from spring with three more.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.850
There are specific packages that were created off course.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.050
Once we progress on the application will describe each one of them.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.340
You can see that the APP has started and we're ready to receive requests from the Google

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.450
Assistant device.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.870
One of the ways to test the book management application without having a real Google

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.350
assistant device is by using a Web simulator under the low flow.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.250
You have this option by accessing the integration step.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.880
Once you navigate to this feature,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.650
you need to select the Web demon option.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.440
This will open a new window where you are invited toe test the application under a but

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.350
interface.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:05.080
You can now interact with the Springboard server and simulate the same flow that the Google

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.350
assistant will follow.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.450
We will test the scenario off retrieving all novel books,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.900
So let's type in the phrase give me all novel books once where the sick the list of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.650
available books for the specified genre,

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.550
we can select the specific book in order together more details.
