00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450
Now that we have both the author and book entities in place,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.670
we need to do the mapping between them,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.150
so we'll choose something like one ought or might have multiple books.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:27.900
So let's create the simple least off books under the indoor water entity would be our new

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.810
or a list.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.050
Let's go on their book.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:49.350
And over here let's you create the variable So this be will be on author.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:00.930
Let's get back to the author Entity Onda.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.150
We need some specific J p A r notations.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.350
So once again we'll annotate it with one too many.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.650
So this will be mapped by the order.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.850
Let's also add,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.360
Ah,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:30.750
Cascade and we will go it cascade the type all and just the where reference.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.080
Let's also add ah or finally move on.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.350
Set to true.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:45.750
This is just a good practice that I like toe to do,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.650
and we need to add some some specific methods to work with the new books list.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.780
So our Addis public void at book that we receive a book as,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.250
ah,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.250
part of matter and for the books list.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.150
I will add this new book to the list and the book.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.050
We'll need,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.240
Ah,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.550
set auto or method with this corresponding or Egypt.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.650
So let's go and fix this state month.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.650
Okay?

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.650
We are generating here.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.850
Getter and setter for the water.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.250
That's great.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.190
Let's go back to the author and you can see that this ah has been fixed.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:09.700
Now let's go to the book entity and for the old door.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:18.490
We need to market us many to one.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.620
And for the Fitch will use fetch,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.750
type lazy.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.750
Okay,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:37.100
So far,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.720
so good.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.550
It looks good.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.360
And basically,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.070
we were able to create the connection between the author and the book entities using this

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:56.250
one too many a notation with the corresponding that are set to it.
