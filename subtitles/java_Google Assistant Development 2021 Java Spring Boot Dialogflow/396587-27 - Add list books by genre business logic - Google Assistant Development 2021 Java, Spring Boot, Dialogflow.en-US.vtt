X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.050
Now let's start building the business logic for Least Book by Gina Corresponding Intent.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.650
So I'm under book service unless create the new method here.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.750
Yeah,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.650
so we're annotated with for intent and use the intent Deal.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:32.050
Let's books by Jonah So this method should once again return in action response.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.790
Let's call it find or bye Ciara.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.450
So this will return or the books that go to spawn toe a specific Jarrah.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.200
And basically these books will be extracted from the MySQL database that's at the logging

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.520
State month Blogger in four.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.150
Executing in,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:13.550
then so intent it till this book's by Jonah.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:23.450
Let's move forward and let's create the string builder.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.050
Let's call it the response,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.550
of course with new string builder.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:40.750
This will keep our con captain ated the response that we will create as part of this method

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.750
.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.150
So we need to retry early three the general part of matter.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.530
If you paid attention,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.750
we need to extract the corresponding slop from the request,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:06.050
so request get parameter Jardel to a string.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:16.780
So now we have the the Jonah that we want toe really Three of the territory of the books

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.770
from the that are very is based on it,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:29.950
so the three of or books that correspond toe the specified genera.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.790
But for this,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.260
we need the new method.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:44.110
Under the book Repository on This will return a list of books,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.580
since we might have one or more books.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.080
So let's call it fine by Jara containing In Nor Case,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.500
since we might have,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.050
Ah,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.510
a different spelling for this general that we received from the Google assistant.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.750
And we will try to do Ah ah,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.380
good match for this.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:20.550
So list book books list and the invoked that method with retrieve slot type,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.250
slow the value.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.300
And now,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:34.700
if we were able to extract the list of books and the list of books contains at least one

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.050
book,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:44.550
we need to start building actual response that will be sent to the user.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.260
Okay,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.350
so response of stealing builder.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:12.050
Let's go it,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.600
ah,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.440
book deal and use an existing method.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.990
Get random list off books message,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.250
since we can really use,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.850
in fact,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.880
ah,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.450
on existing message that we already defined for a previous intent.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:41.350
I'm tryingto reuse messages as much as possible,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.150
but also have this ah,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.060
random,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.840
random or generator behind the scenes toe generate a message.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.830
A different message,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.060
at least right to generate the different message.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:03.270
Each and every time we discuss with the Google home are in creating a soon Joyner.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.780
Since I need to parse the the book list in Kolkata,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:19.180
in Tomcat in Aidem list of books that were extract from from the database that corresponds

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.150
to this Jara.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.620
Now,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.350
we should add a list of books to the response,

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.550
Okay?

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.250
And let's also finish the sentence.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:52.950
Now we can add the custom message back to the response.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.410
So,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:02.550
such as we want to the user to continue the process toe effect,

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.790
Um,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.950
select the book.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.150
So I'm losing on existing method from this list.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.350
Okay,

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.150
this will generate the r and a message from that list.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:30.650
And if he were not ableto find any books was go on this alternative use case,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.890
and we need to add ah,

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.250
corresponding message back to the user.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:43.590
And for this,

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.190
let's go under book deal.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:59.850
Let's at the new constant value was call it books not found message.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.250
Since this will map toe.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:09.790
So the specific use case and we can go with ah,

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:19.250
something like no books found based on request and let's has the user toe try again.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:29.250
We can really name the first the force Constand Toby More descriptive.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:38.050
Since that would have mapped toe a single book can fix this.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.700
We need to add the book,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.950
not found the message.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.850
Okay.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:08:02.050
And let's use the newly created the constant So response append book deal books not found a

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:02.650
message.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:20.030
So also handled this use case and now is the time to basically create a response as the

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.840
response wilder and the action response.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.730
And in fact,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.650
we returned the action response back to the controller from this ah,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:35.400
from this method So response Build a response builder,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.340
Get the response builder Once again,

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.900
this is a method from the actions on Google.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:49.430
Is decay or helper mattered That said the response to string Well,

00:08:49.430 --> 00:09:03.460
great now the action in response response builder that built And also we can create the we

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.850
can return the actual response.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.310
Okay,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.600
let's go back to the controller and that's basically it
