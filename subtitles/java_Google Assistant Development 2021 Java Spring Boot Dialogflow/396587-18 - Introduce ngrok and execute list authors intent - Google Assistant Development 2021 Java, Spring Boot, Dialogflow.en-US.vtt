00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
Okay,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.030
guys.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.750
So we have the business logic in place for the early starters,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:21.700
and now we need to add a fulfillment so that we can help and tell Google Home Assistant Toe

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.650
execute our server using a post request.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.640
So in order to achieve these,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.720
let's ah force enable the Web hook,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.360
and we'll need are are you are behind the scenes you guys saw that we invoke are several

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:50.700
using local holes 80 80 Google home and dialogue flow requires 80 81 were using https.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.290
So we have a tool to transform our local host.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.340
80 82 um,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.170
https 80 81.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.350
This has got an rock.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.850
So I went to an Grok download website and downloaded and Rock Zip.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.980
I will.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.090
Exactly.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.490
It's content and it's fairly simple to start the and grok process.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:41.870
Let's first create a folder over here and copy the and Rock in Gros Kings Equitable and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.050
let's open a common Prompt and typing and rock 80 to be 80 80.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:55.550
So behind the scenes this service connects to our local environment on Port 80 80 and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:07.330
transform Sito Https specific away request so you can see that this is accessible also

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.900
online.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.860
So we're basically moving our local service Toby,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.050
accessible online.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:24.870
So let's go toe Arthur.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.120
Look,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.650
flow.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.270
Let's close this and,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.750
uh,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.350
copy the You are well and add a P I slash actions since he if you recall,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:47.850
this is how we are able toe invoke our actions controller from our spring Bhutto job

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.650
application.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.350
We save and let's go on the intense step.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.400
But first,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.850
let's start application.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.550
Since the server is not your started gay spring boot up,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.700
it's starting with that local host 80 80 Pork music and Rock.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.400
This will be transform toe https,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.160
and we added that you are once again under dialogue.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.350
Flow with hook.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.240
Okay,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.150
the server has started.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:45.750
Let's clear this and on the intense let's navigate to least all tours and let's to ah,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.550
sample test.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.450
Let's type in get least off all doors.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.010
This will.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.920
Behind the scenes invoke are spring,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.210
both Java application least daughter's business lunch,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.440
and you can see the result here.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.970
The study stopped authorities Leo Tolstoy,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.250
Mark Twain,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.240
William Shakespeare.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:20.650
I could provide the list of books if you choose another so you can see that indeed,

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.550
our application was was was three good buyers.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.480
Ah,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.190
Google home.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:38.240
Some blogging messages execute post action.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.250
Also the Jason that is received by ah,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.200
our application.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.950
We can see the query text and also the intent that is triggered early starters.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:05:04.360
If you recall we're constructing the the response you're zika some random state months and

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.950
also add a list off authors back.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:17.250
So far,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.950
so good.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.950
Yeah.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.130
This is the business logic for the list of voters.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:33.680
So the next step will be to continue this process and based on the author selection,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.600
we'll need to retrieve um,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.880
the authors corresponding list of books.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.900
This will be done in.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.250
Ah,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.970
you know,

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.670
next PDO.
