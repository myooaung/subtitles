00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Under this video,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.400
we'll need to implement a business logic toe handle the least book by auto intent.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.740
So first,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.200
the let's Go and create the new service and call it book service.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:27.120
Since this is a service will need to be annotated with the service stereotype and also with

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.810
transactional.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.250
Since we will invoke specific database operations,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.450
similar taught or service needs to extend the the look flow app,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.350
toe handle a specific away actions on Google Oh methods.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:01:05.150
We'll add a lager based on this class that's important missing stuff.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.490
And let's ah,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:22.480
set up for intent with intent to tail less poops by auto this method when it toe return on

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.050
action response,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:34.350
find or buy Auto is the metal name and receives the action request.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.350
The request has ah Param Eter.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.880
Let's have some space.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.220
The first thing will do.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.580
Ah,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:59.690
logging message and we'll type executing intent and the intent It still least books by

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.250
author.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:18.740
Now you can see that we need toe Somehow Extract is given name and last name slots from the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.490
requests received from Ah Google Home.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.720
In order to do this,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:38.550
willow create ah first variable called given name and based from the request will extract

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.240
the perimeter and map it toe a string.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.550
Same thing for the last name.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.520
Chris,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.550
Get perimeter.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:58.000
Last name and the to sing for For it also Well,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.350
at the descriptive comment here.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.030
Reviewable name,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.950
last name from the request.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:24.050
Now we should go on there under our book repository.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.850
Oh,

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.970
actual.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.560
Actually,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.840
under our authority,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:39.050
post story and the implement a new method called find by given name containing ignore case

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.920
and last name containing in nor case basically this willow you Spring Data GP a behind the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:56.910
scenes to extract on auto or based on the possible match between it's given name and last

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:10.610
name by the false Ping Data GP will be ableto handle all these Esquivel transformation that

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.150
will be done behind the scenes.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.850
And you can see that I have given name last name as,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.240
ah,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.250
unique constraint.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:33.150
This is why I'm retrieving only one author over there prior that the message retrieve water

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.350
from database.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.350
But first,

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.900
let's hear That's other auto repository.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.980
Okay?

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:55.850
Injected here and let's extract photo or from the auto repository with this long method

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:06.070
where we add the Cuban name and last name and now we should check if the auto or is not

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.570
know this means that we found on authority in the robberies.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:20.930
And we should get the list of books that our map to this porter for this will use the book

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.850
repository I'll injected here.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:38.600
Now let's go with this Books,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.790
books list and get the list off books.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:56.140
Okay,

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.520
As a next step,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.040
we need to start the wheel.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.050
The response that will be sent back to user.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:19.650
Let's force create the string builder that will contain our response.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:27.300
Let's upend under these response.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.000
Um,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.300
booklet,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.850
deal that get random list off book message.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.470
So if you recall this,

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.550
will extractor and the message from the initial list,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.680
for example.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.060
Sure,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.880
I got this books in my list.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:57.920
She was with this error.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.400
Okay,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.650
Saved the auto repository.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:10.750
And now we should create a scene journal toe at the comma delimited list off books.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:17.440
So create a scene.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:27.850
Join our you staying Joyner's go my an empty space.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:42.250
Now we should eat a rate over the books list and for each book will add the book to string

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.250
.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:57.510
If you recall the to sing metal just ah return us the book title as the next step We need

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.970
toe.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:10.230
Add a list of books toe the response so response upend and over here,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:17.230
up in the SG that will contain the list of books and also up in the dot.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.040
At the instance,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:25.060
we finish the sentence So far,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.790
so good in this process.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:42.420
Now let's add a new comment and at a random message toe,

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:48.750
ask the user to basically select a book to continue the process,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:59.860
and we will select a random book from the second list Orlando necessary from the second

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.200
list.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.760
So is he here?

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.950
The second list?

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.550
Okay,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.480
we are in a good state now.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.980
And if not,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:25.150
if the author was not found in the database for some reason the given name is last name was

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.900
not found.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:34.450
We need to add a corresponding message their law user that the author was not found.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:42.160
And let's add in you constant value Public static,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.150
final string.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.050
Let's go with not found message.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:10:12.970
And for this we can go with something like I haven't found the specified auto or and um,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.120
questions such as no,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.650
uh,

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.490
statements such as police.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.150
Try again.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.440
Now let's add this.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.950
Ah,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:34.910
not found message back in case that the daughter was not founded,

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.750
that are Berries.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:40.150
So we were able to handle this case also.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:55.950
And now let's create the response as the action response that will be sent back to our

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:02.550
control when this metal will be invoked from the book service.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.390
So once again,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.790
the response builder,

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.290
the response builder,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:22.150
Get the response builder at the response to shrink.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:34.070
And we need to create the action in response response.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:40.490
Build her build and let's return also the actual response.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:53.350
Okay.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.550
And let's go toe action controller.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:05.610
And over here we need to inject the book service.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.410
So the war Dr.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:10.650
What?

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.600
Book service,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:26.750
book service and similar toe The least Daughters process.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:40.440
We can t o copy Paste and just replace the Jason name and with the book and we will use the

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.450
book service toe handle this request.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:47.850
So now we should be able to handle this request properly.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:55.650
The next step is to navigate to dialogue flow and invoked the least books by author request
