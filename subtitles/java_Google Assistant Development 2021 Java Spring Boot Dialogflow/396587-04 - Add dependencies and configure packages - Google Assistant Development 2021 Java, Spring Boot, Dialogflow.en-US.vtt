00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
now,

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.060
the next step in our project configuration is to set up some springboard specific

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:16.950
dependencies so you can navigate toe bomb that XML wait for this subject to open.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.050
And over here,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.410
you can see that it will have the springboard started.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.740
Worked.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.290
Abundance.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.060
See that?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.250
We just added in the previous video.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.150
And let's add a new dependency.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.150
Okay,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.350
we should insert the group i d such as,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.550
or Spring framework Booth.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.010
And next to it is Ah,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.150
corresponding artifact i d.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:57.150
This is spring both starter,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.790
the G p A.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:09.210
This will basically set up our main infrastructure in orderto work with J P.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.450
A.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.350
Okay.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:27.300
And the next thing will be a tow other My school dependency since we were also need those

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.010
specific my school driver such as,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:42.350
um Springwood Data GB will be able to know which that our base to connect.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.790
So the group I d.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.850
My skill and the artifact i d should be my skill connector Java.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.550
That's also at the comment here.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.350
Springwood.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.050
We're specific dependency.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.820
Okay,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.220
So far,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.750
so good.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.250
I think we have all the dependencies in place.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:43.640
Now let's go and create the new package and let's call it go on that book management that

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:56.160
component and basically let's move forward and create the rest off required packages for

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.950
our project.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.690
This will be calm.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:08.350
Book management controller where we will store our controller Also a new package.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:26.610
Go on that book management That domain where we were a store Our domain classes in a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:37.040
package Calm book management repose story This will be helper interfaces toe I work with

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:46.580
are not that base Com Book Management Service The new package where we'll store our

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:55.350
business Logical importance and com book management Not you till package.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.640
Okay,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:07.150
so we have all the packages in place now The next step is to set up our domain classes.
