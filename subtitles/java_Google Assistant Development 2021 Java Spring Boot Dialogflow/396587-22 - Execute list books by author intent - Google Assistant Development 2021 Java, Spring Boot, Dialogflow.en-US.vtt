00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
in the previous video or implement at the Business Logic Toe Handle the league's books by

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.950
author.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:17.180
So we have least authors and this post by author or intense Let's start the server and go

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:26.270
back to with the dialogue flow toe have a demo on the least authors,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.850
followed by his books by author.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.500
Corresponding.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.090
Intense.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.250
That's what for this too to start.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.710
Okay and let's live the Consul.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.240
Okay,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.150
let's first set a message toe least our powers.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:01:06.760
You can see that our server was requested with this intent and we were able toe return a

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.350
response under Ah,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.350
no look flow.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.870
And now let's go and select on auto or let's choose,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.050
Leo told story.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:35.300
And over here we see that we were able to extract a message from the server and we prepare

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.700
the infrastructure for the next intent.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.250
And you can see that the least books by author intent was requested also,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.890
and the message has been no has been sent back toe Google home.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.850
Now the next step will be to implement ah,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.280
the case where ah,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.450
the user will be able to select the book
