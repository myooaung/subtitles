WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790
so in the previous video was set up the least posed by auto corresponding intent under

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.740
dialogue flow.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.250
And now we need to implement the business logic.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.250
But first,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.070
let's also add a couple of friend,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.210
um,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:23.020
messages that will be used by Google Home as responses similar to what we've done for the

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.550
least author's intent.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:37.450
So we should create hero new Class called booklet deals,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.770
since this is,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.240
ah,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.250
a class related toe book messages.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:01:00.950
So once again we will follow the same Persepolis what we've done for the auto deal.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:16.950
So I'm creating a public static final list off strings and let's call it least off books,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.850
messages.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.150
Yeah,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:30.000
your A list and let's import the missing pieces.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.110
Once again,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.850
a new list.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.450
Let's call it list off books,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.350
selection messages.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:57.560
You're a list and for the messages will do another copy paste for you guys to not wait.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.350
Me too.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.410
Type in this ah longer messages,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:15.290
so we'll have a static block where we will see three messages were added for the initial

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.380
less than three for the second list.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.390
Now we need to implement ah metas toe.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.950
Get around the message from each off this to list.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.650
So go with public static string again,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.090
a random list,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.390
off book messages.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:52.350
He didn't take your value that Will Extract actually will generate a random value from the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.100
list off book messages.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:14.940
So next thing list of book messages that SARS so will generate are under Vela Bitten zero

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.500
and two.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.950
And now let's return the list off book messages that get this stuff book.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.890
Well,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.550
okay,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:40.530
now for the second method Public string,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.240
public static strength.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.750
Get random book selection message.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.860
Generate an integer from the second list.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.950
List off book selection messages.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.560
Once again,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.330
you are Frito.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:06.280
Add as many messages for each of this lists or for the authority list without any issue.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:22.550
Since this Cold War work and now return list off book selection messages not get,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.850
and we'll use that random value.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.280
All right,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.050
so we have to list too around the methods,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:41.910
and let's go under intense util at Add a new constant value least books,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:50.710
my authority and okay,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.750
this book by author.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.310
Now we have this if statement over here,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.810
but we also need to introduce the least books by auto intent.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.710
So let's comment this coat and instead off if statements.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.580
Let's use a switch statement over here so we'll have a switch.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:25.530
And based on the intent name in case off intently till least all doors well still invoked

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.060
the previous business logic that will,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.450
uh,

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:43.750
around the auto or service least daughters method that's removed his break state month.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:55.360
And now we need toe ad the case where we need to invoke the intent You deal Lee exposed by

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.950
motor.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.050
Okay,

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.950
since when we invoked this Ah,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.550
this case will actually need to trigger the book service.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:22.550
His book service will be created and order the book service least books by auto intent.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.290
Corresponding business logic.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.360
Now,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.160
unless you remove this Ah,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.150
old gold and clean up a bit.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:47.640
So we have two cases least thought or sleaze books by author or and also in case off his

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.020
book by auto restrictor.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.450
Now let's add ah,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.050
corresponding message will be changed.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.380
Actually,

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.150
this will be implemented soon,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.200
and the let's also add a default gays,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:19.300
baritone or response entity with the string and the message request could not be but assist

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.650
and http status code with okay,

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:32.910
now we need to mean from in the business logic
