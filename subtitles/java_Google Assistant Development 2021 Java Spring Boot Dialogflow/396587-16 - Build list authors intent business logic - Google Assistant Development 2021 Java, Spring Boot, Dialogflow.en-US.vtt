00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
in this video,

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.450
let's implement a business logic toe handle the least author's intent.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.680
So we have the intent name and on the previous video,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.860
we set up the infrastructure toe,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.440
provide random messages as response to Google.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:25.550
Google assistant can see that we have to list that we were used later in this video.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.800
So first,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.950
let's create the new class under the service package.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.550
Let's call it ought or service.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.750
Okay,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.600
since this is,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.070
ah,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.220
service that will have business logic that's annotated with service and also with

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.040
transactional,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:03.250
since we will revoke specific that are based squared is so in order to use this service

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.750
with the action on Google is decayed.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.700
We will need somehow mechanisms toe handle this process.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.650
So,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.150
under actions on Google maple dependency,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:36.540
we have this concept off the look flow app that will allow us to doing vocal toe handles,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.230
actually specific,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.550
intense and provide them with the corresponding business logic.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.950
So you can see that I extended this Ah,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.850
this class and we need this four intent least falters,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.030
such as when Google Home will invoke our service automatically using the sanitation with

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.050
least daughters.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.970
This method will contain the business logic toe handle the request and sent back.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.350
Oh,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.750
actual response to Google home.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:25.360
So I call this method find all Smith Old will receive on action request and once again will

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.180
really turned back on actual response.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.220
So let's ah,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:44.960
let's use this lager to set up a statement here lager that in for executing intent least

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.810
authors,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.150
this is just an informative message.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:03:08.800
Analysts first finally stop authors from the database the Starters authors list in order to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.050
extract data from the database.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.350
We're used the corresponding repository.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:26.250
So I went to inject the oh torso repository That's import the stuff here.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.150
And let's use the authority people story,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.650
find or method.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.850
This is spring data GPS specific.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.900
And now,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.840
since we have the list of voters,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.810
let's start creating the response.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.750
Basically,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.150
the response that will be sent back toe Google a system our creator,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.350
spring builder,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:06.290
new spring builder and let's use the auditory deal.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.850
Get random least off authors message.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.780
So as initial response,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.650
we'll use this method,

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:29.650
and Google Home will first use Ah use a random message from that method now.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.520
Well,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.950
uh,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.710
here's the string Joyner.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.250
So basically,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.750
add the comma the limited list off voters and,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.320
um,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.120
more fashion.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.550
Wait.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.390
So let's create a string.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:05:04.640
Join our SG new string Joyner and at a coma and the empty space Now we should the every

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:19.540
gate on the voters list forage oh tour And for each photo or we will ah add the author or

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.130
the string method under it.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.750
So if you recall the to sing method,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.050
it's a concatenation between the given name and last name.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:37.030
Okay,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.390
so far,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.950
so good.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.760
Now,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.750
on the next step,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.850
we will add the list off doors.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:51.280
So the response so really called that response is a string wilder.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:05.880
So the response that append And over here we're had a SG So this will contain the list off

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.250
authors that is concurred in a tid and is delimited by a comma.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.550
That's also add ah,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.710
that here.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:31.850
Since we end a sentence and get the random message from the second list,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.880
this will,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.250
Oh,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.690
ask the user basically to continue the process.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.250
So I imagine something like this,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.520
uh,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.150
here is the list off voters.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:55.480
We're numerator list off waters and will tell the user to choose a not or to continue the

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:06.350
process response that append auto retail Get random authors selection message.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.810
Can you see that a message,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:24.950
a message display will choose one of them in a random fashion and at the final step,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.980
well,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.650
actually created Action response object and other string builder response to it.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:40.750
In order to do this,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.620
force will need our response.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.350
Builder Response builder.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:54.940
We'll use the method from this actions on Google as decay called Get response builder from

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.650
the request,

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.950
we'll add ah,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:05.850
response to shrink since the responses of string Wilder and we need the seeing over there.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:20.340
And Creator Action responds from the response builder that built method and just returned

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:26.050
this action response back toe back to the user.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.100
Actually,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:36.150
this will be returned to the control at the at the next step.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.510
But first,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.160
let's get let's ah,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.350
add on informative message and something like this would work,

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.650
since we want to also lock this message back.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.790
So in the next step,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.540
once again,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.650
we need to,

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.470
uh,

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:17.750
invoke this dis mattered this final method from our controller over here
