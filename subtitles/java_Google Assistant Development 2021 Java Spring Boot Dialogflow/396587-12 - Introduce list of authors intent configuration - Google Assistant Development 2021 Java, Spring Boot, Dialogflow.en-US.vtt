00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
now,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.090
since you have this agent created,

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.950
we can see that we have to intense already set up for us.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:16.450
What God intends whom I ask Interns are basically mapping Is Bettina user queries and

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.200
actuals fulfilled by our software.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.490
Your softer in this context,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.380
maps toe our spring boot management job application.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.280
So let's force take a look at this.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.760
Ah,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.540
default.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.080
Intense.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.050
This is the default welcome intent.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:44.670
Basically the first intent that kicks in when way invoke our are our customs skill our book

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.630
management collection,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.350
custom skill.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.660
We can see that we don't have any context.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.580
Contacts will be introduced later in this chapter,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.850
so don't worry about this for now.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.920
The events we can see the welcome event.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.950
This is the initial event and there are some training phase phrases already configured for

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.250
us action and part of matters are not important for this intent.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.910
Ah,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.850
this is these are the default responses that we received from Google.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:28.690
A system and fulfillment fulfillment basically will will be required for our own custom,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.750
custom intense that will build as part of this project.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.650
Let's move toe the default fallback intent.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.940
Basically,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.470
this this fallback intent is require.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.780
Well,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.550
the Google assistant doesn't actually understand what we ask him.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.790
So by default he will provide us with a specific message.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.800
Once again,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.490
the context are empty since they are not required.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.940
Also,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:12.140
the events we can scroll down a bit and D Sarto default responses.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.190
You can see some specific responses such as one more time and so on.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.650
The fulfillment once again is not important for this intent.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.550
So lets for start by creating our initial intent.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:45.050
Click on the Create Barton and you can see that we need to set up our intent name.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.050
Let's go with laced all those This will be our first intent.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:09.460
Let's save it now It's saving Okay for the context Currently will not define a specific

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.350
context,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:20.150
at least for this moment on the events once again will not work with events.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.420
Um,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.950
yeah,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.820
for the training phrases,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.950
the training phrases are important So we can set up some specific during phrases so that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.550
Google assistant will know how to kick this event.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:49.710
This Ah this intento So we'll go with finally Stoff authors Ah once more tell me which

00:03:49.710 --> 00:04:05.270
authors who have Maybe you're not the ones such as Give me the least of voters and maybe

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.150
another one provide authors list.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.050
So if Google assistant will hear any off this phrases,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:21.920
he will know that he will need to kick this least thought or intent the final one that I

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.350
wanted to introduce his get least off others.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:34.650
Let's click on Save so that the agent agent training will start.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.150
You can see here,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:47.050
and basically the agent has been trained okay for the action and parliament there's not now

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.050
.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.450
The responses were not introduced responses here,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.000
but instead will focus on the fulfillment.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.150
And we should enable the fulfillment here,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:12.430
basically to let the Google home assistant invoke are back and service returning in spring

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.350
boot job application.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.550
So we should enable Web Hook call for this intent.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.850
And we're not interested in the slots.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.950
Feeling should click on save now.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.450
Okay?

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.350
And then say
