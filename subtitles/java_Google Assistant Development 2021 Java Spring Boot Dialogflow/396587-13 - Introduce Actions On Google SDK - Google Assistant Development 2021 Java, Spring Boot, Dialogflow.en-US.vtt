00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
Okay,

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.950
guys.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.830
So our intent is set up under dialogue flow worldly now,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.650
or mechanisms toe basically implement the business lodge in our spring put application.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.730
So in order to achieve this,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.750
we will use actions on Google A sick eight.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.570
You can see that I navigated toe action song.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.750
Go,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:36.380
go as decay give hop page where you can fired several Ri sources with four.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:49.260
Our project will need the corresponding maven dependency so we can choose this one.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.050
Okay?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.950
And you can find the dependency here,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.680
but they in fact,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.450
are choose the latest version one that $8.0.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:12.050
So let's go be plays this and move it to our project for the boom file.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.450
And just based this content based the dependency over here.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.600
Basically,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.410
in order to use these actions on Google,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:41.230
sdk are Google assistant needs to invoke our application using posed http request so first

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.370
thing,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.750
force.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.250
In order to achieve this,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.650
we will need toe set up a controller,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:02:03.250
so lets navigate now toe the corresponding package gone Book management control and creator

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.790
You controller,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:20.430
Let's call it actions Control over here will set ah or this control a notation to tell

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:32.100
spring that this will be a controller that will basically return us arrest toe arrested,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:42.590
specific responses and also an update This class also with the ridiculous mapping with a p

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.750
I slash actions.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:54.450
So Google Home Assistant will be able to evoke our business logic using Go using this Ah,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:09.250
you are now once again Google A system requires that posed http request since he is ableto

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.360
to invoke Onley Disciples requests.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:23.260
So let's start by creating our initial method the handle this type of off requests So o

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:35.740
creator method and annotated with post mapping was the public response entity since I was

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:45.510
want toe return Ah response entity object Let's call it execute post action And as method

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:54.050
arguments were received the http several request and http server response.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.690
Basically,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:08.750
we will receive a request and Turner response Now by default.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.900
Let's go.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:20.150
It's something like New Response entity and HDTV staples that Okay,

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.450
since I would want toe just really thorn a sample state one for now,

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:36.750
just the be able to compile this coat and if for any reason this ah,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:45.500
this control will be invoked Former from a local browser that's also handled this case and

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.550
the adul get mapping annotation for this method.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.390
A return.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.720
Also response entity or call this metal execute,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.770
Get action.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:09.850
What I would like to do is basically toe your eternal sample sample text message that

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.000
Google assistant is only ableto execute post requests.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.900
This is just any formative message for way of our invokes.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.350
This this a p i from other afford.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.780
It is from a browser,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.510
for example.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.250
Okay,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.150
I set up this informative message.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.450
And also http status that Okay,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:49.050
cable it.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:06:02.450
Let's start the application and the initial test from our chrome borough.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.850
Sir,

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.750
wait for this to start.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:19.410
Don't get server on Port 80 80 and we should go to Chrome browser.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.950
You can use whatever browser you like.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.250
Navigate the local host a 80 a p i slash actions,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.310
and it works.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.650
The four months of messages displayed
