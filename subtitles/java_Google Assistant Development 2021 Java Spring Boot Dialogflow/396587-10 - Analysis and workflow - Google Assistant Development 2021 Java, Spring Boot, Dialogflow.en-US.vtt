00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670
now,

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.110
since we have the initial job back and server in place,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.250
we can start building our actual Google assistant app.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.290
There are some steps that we need to follow.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.050
First,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.250
we need to create the actions on Google Project.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.830
The first step is to create Register our new project under consul DOT actions that google

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.550
dot com,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000
also under the space,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.550
will be invited to set up on agent under dialogue Flow.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.150
By using this agent will have the possibility toe create intense that act as user requests

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.250
for each operation that we want our Google assistant tobe able to just turn eight.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.660
We need to set up the support for this process impossible to this intent creation process.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.850
We will develop our Java back and functionality.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.700
This is required toe handle the requests that we receive from Google assistant and Computer

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.350
Response that will be returned back to the device in order to facilitate these

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.950
communication between the Google assistant and our job back and service.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.470
We will call finger the Web hook fulfillment by using Angra and rock is a simple tool that

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.870
we can use to expose publicly or local back and service so that there look,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.150
flow will be ableto actually call Java application.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.850
Also,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.690
we will be able to see how to test the application in different ways using a simulator or

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.880
even a real Google assistant device.
