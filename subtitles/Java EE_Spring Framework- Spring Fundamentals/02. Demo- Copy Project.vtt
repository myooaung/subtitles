00:00:01.394 --> 00:00:04.527
Just like we did when we were configuring our Spring

2
00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:08.928
Java configured enable application, I went ahead and closed everything,

3
00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:12.506
and I actually opened up our original conference app just

4
00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:15.554
so can look at it and reference it, although,

5
00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:17.532
that really doesn't matter because we're going to copy this

6
00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:20.357
and open up the XML- configured app anyway.

7
00:00:20.357 --> 00:00:25.298
So I've closed all the files down, got it down to just the basic desktop,

8
00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:28.343
and I'm going to switch over to my workspace.

9
00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:30.680
Now I'm going to take our conference app,

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.683
not our conference-java, but our conference app,

11
00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:42.745
Copy, and Paste that, and I'm going to call mine conference-xml,

12
00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:46.743
and enter that.

13
00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:54.587
I'm going to switch back to my IDE, and now I want to go to File,

14
00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:58.806
Open, and I want to navigate down to my workspace,

15
00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:07.141
and open up the conference-xml project.

16
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:13.194
And I'm going to choose this window to replace the contents that we had there.

17
00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:16.791
And now we have our basic project structure up and ready to go.

18
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:23.020
We'll go ahead and run it, making sure that everything is set up the right way.

19
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.964
I want to navigate down to my source, main,

20
00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:38.848
java, Application, and right-click, and say Run Application.main.

21
00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.864
Let's make sure that everything still finishes and

22
00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:44.571
completes exactly how we expect it to, and it does.

23
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.030
Now this, again,

24
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.623
should be the basic project that didn't have any of

25
00:01:49.623 --> 00:01:51.102
your Java configuration in there.

26
00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:51.967
I can't stress that enough.

27
00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:56.600
We don't want to try and mix the Java configuration with the XML configuration.

28
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.477
So our Application.java file should be just this hard-coded SpeakerService,

29
00:02:04.477 --> 00:02:06.638
creating a new SpeakerServiceImpl.

30
00:02:06.638 --> 00:02:10.603
It has the System.out .println in there for just the original find.

31
00:02:10.603 --> 00:02:14.537
Our model and service are all pretty basic,

32
00:02:14.537 --> 00:02:16.111
a repository, in fact,

33
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:19.432
our SpeakerServiceImpl should have that hard-coded

34
00:02:19.432 --> 00:02:21.374
HibernateSpeakerRepositoryImpl in here.

35
00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:24.568
That's what we're going to do with the XML configuration now

36
00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:27.152
just like we did with the Java configuration.

37
00:02:27.152 --> 00:02:28.429
Now I can't stress enough,

38
00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.979
I am going to show you a couple techniques with XML and

39
00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.456
their equivalent in the Java configuration as we do this to

40
00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.096
help compare and contrast it.

41
00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:39.010
So if you think we're just going to cover XML, we're not.

42
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.503
We're going to go through some Java configuration techniques

43
00:02:41.503 --> 00:02:47.000
as well to show you how they compare to one another and the power of one over the other.
