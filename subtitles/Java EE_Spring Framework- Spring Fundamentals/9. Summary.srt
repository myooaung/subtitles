00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:02,033
In this module,

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:06,797
we discussed the various scopes that are available inside the Spring container,

3
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:10,227
namely singleton and prototype.

4
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:12,803
We showed examples of how to configure both of

5
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:15,691
those using the Java configuration.

6
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,062
We then mentioned the web scopes that are available,

7
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:21,620
but they are outside the scope of this module and of this

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,894
course really because we have to set up an entire web

9
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,794
application just to demonstrate them.

10
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:30,829
Those three scopes are request, session, and globalSession.

11
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,413
We then discussed autowiring.

12
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:36,808
We showed an example using setter injection and constructor

13
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:42,095
injection and showed that you can use the component scanner to

14
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:46,233
wire those apps up or you can do a hybrid.

15
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,154
Our first example we had with this was just a hybrid of

16
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:50,993
some of the methods being autowired,

17
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:54,829
but still having our beans defined in that AppConfig.

18
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,076
If that makes you feel more comfortable in using it,

19
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:58,386
use it that way,

20
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:02,129
but I will say the more convenient way is to go with full autowiring

21
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,070
using those stereotype annotations that we discussed.

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,726
Let's look at what we can do with the XML configuration,

23
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:15,000
and we're going to run through some smaller examples because it's very similar to Java now.
