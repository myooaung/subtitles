00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:06.093
To begin setting up our application to show you the capabilities of Spring,

2
00:00:06.093 --> 00:00:10.124
I'm going to start off with opening up my IDE.

3
00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:11.840
I'm using IntelliJ for this course,

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.827
as I had mentioned in the prerequisite section.

5
00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.487
You can see the version I'm using here,

6
00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:18.758
but I don't think that would really matter to you.

7
00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:23.266
Any recent version should work for what we're going to do inside of this course.

8
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.935
I'm going to click Create New Project, and inside of here,

9
00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:32.013
I'm going to select the project SDK as Java 11.

10
00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:36.219
I am not going to choose create from archetype because that'll walk us through a

11
00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.225
bunch of dialogs that we don't care about for this course,

12
00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:43.158
and I'm going to select Maven over here on the left.

13
00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:45.945
Then I'm going to click Next.

14
00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.341
For our GroupId, I'm going to put in com.pluralsight,

15
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:56.991
and for the ArtifactId, I just want to enter conference,

16
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:59.111
and click Next.

17
00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:04.891
And then for our workspace I like to just have something simple in

18
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:11.197
here as workspace and the project name of conference.

19
00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:15.232
So I have dev/workspace/conference.

20
00:01:15.232 --> 00:01:17.225
I'm going to click Finish.

21
00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:20.911
It will ask me if I want to create that directory.

22
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:29.413
Yes, I do, and then it will launch my application.

23
00:01:29.413 --> 00:01:32.988
So as you can see inside of here now, we have a basic POM file,

24
00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:38.190
and it's created our folder structure for us containing the source,

25
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.823
main, java directory, and resources directory,

26
00:01:40.823 --> 00:01:45.616
as well as the source, test, java directory.

27
00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:54.000
We're going to break down each of these in subsequent examples, so let's stop here as we have our base project set up for us now.
