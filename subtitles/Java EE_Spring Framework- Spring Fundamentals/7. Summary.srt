1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:05,582
We looked at a bunch of advanced bean configuration techniques in this module.

2
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:08,516
We started off by going through the bean lifecycle,

3
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:12,738
and the key point with that, there were a lot of steps in there,

4
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:14,901
you want to pay attention to the init method step.

5
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:18,540
That's what allows us to hook into that post construct

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,835
annotation and add that functionality to our beans.

7
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:23,484
Next,

8
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:27,900
we configured a FactoryBean from scratch and implemented

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,968
some static code inside of our application,

10
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:33,030
and that's really one of the main takeaways there is that

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,149
when you're needing to integrate some legacy code or maybe

12
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,346
some code with a static initializer,

13
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:41,758
the FactoryBean and wrapping that is a great way to go

14
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:44,006
about that and be able to autowire that and still inject

15
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,423
it into your application now.

16
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:49,540
Then we went through Spring Expression Language and showed how you

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,993
could go ahead and interface some other code and libraries and

18
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:56,972
manipulate the object graph at runtime.

19
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:59,660
It's a very powerful way for you to go about doing that.

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,028
Then we talked briefly about proxies.

21
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,610
Proxies are a very advanced technique.

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,808
Just wanted to whet your appetite a little bit with them and show you that

23
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:12,328
they're out there and make you aware that Spring uses them,

24
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:15,397
but they're not something that you would use on a day-to-day

25
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:18,406
basis and you shouldn't be looking for opportunities to

26
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:21,457
integrate them inside of your application.

27
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:26,247
The last thing we did was implement bean profiles inside of our app,

28
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:31,281
and it was a great way to show you that you may have some code in there

29
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,962
that you want to make sure doesn't get into production.

30
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:38,049
If you use it just for that, it's a great tool.

31
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,646
So what's next for you?

32
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:42,748
Well, this is the end of this course, and if you enjoyed it,

33
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:45,914
I would really appreciate if you would leave me a review.

34
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:47,181
If you liked my course,

35
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:50,031
there are a bunch of other courses that I've produced out there.

36
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:54,672
In fact, one of the next ones I would recommend is the Spring MVC intro course.

37
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:58,862
There is also a great course on Spring Boot fundamentals that Dan

38
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:02,313
Bunker has put together that is a great course as well.

39
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:03,713
I've taken it myself,

40
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:07,375
and I would recommend both of those to you as a next step in your journey

41
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:11,616
and continue to follow along the learning path for Spring,

42
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:14,000
on Pluralsight. Thank you.
