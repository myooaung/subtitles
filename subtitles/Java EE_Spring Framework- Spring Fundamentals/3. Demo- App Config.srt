1
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:08,111
our application, we want to create a file where we can Bootstrap everything at.

2
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:13,245
I'm going to close our build section here and navigate over to our source,

3
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:18,688
main, java directory again, and right-click and do a New Java Class.

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,623
This is a very simple class to start with.

5
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:24,799
We're just going to call this AppConfig.

6
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,667
Now it doesn't need to be named this.

7
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:30,377
This is kind of a default standard or a norm.

8
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:32,094
You could call it whatever you like,

9
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:34,771
but we're going to choose AppConfig just to stay

10
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:39,067
consistent with what we're doing, and click Enter.

11
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,449
This is it.

12
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:44,177
This is all we need to start Bootstrapping our application.

13
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:49,804
If you've used any other versions of Spring where you did XML configuration,

14
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:52,858
this would be the start of your application context,

15
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:58,723
so this is where you start configuring the context of your application.

16
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:03,008
All of your configuration starts at this point and

17
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,624
trickles throughout your application here.

18
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,889
So there's nothing special about it.

19
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:11,736
You'll notice it's a default public class.

20
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:12,986
There's no methods.

21
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:14,654
It's a plain POJO.

22
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:17,687
We'll go ahead and start adding annotation to this,

23
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:23,000
but before we do, let's go ahead and talk about what those configured annotations are.
