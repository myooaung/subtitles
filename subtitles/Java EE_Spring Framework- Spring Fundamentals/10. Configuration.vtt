00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.396
Spring is all about removing configuration code from your application.

2
00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:08.571
Why is configuration code such a bad thing in your app?

3
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.904
Well, it makes things brittle, and by brittle,

4
00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:14.025
I mean hard to move to different environments.

5
00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.400
You maybe haven't experienced this yet in your career,

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.453
but have you ever had to recompile your code because you were

7
00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:22.321
deploying it to a different server environment?

8
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:23.063
What about testing?

9
00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:25.651
One of the things I hear as I'm coaching people

10
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.608
through agile development is that, well,

11
00:00:27.608 --> 00:00:31.188
we don't do unit tests because it's really hard to test our code.

12
00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:33.970
We have really complex code.

13
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.000
And I'll tell you right now that it's not the complexity

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.435
of the code that makes it hard to test, it's the way the code was written.

15
00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:44.751
It's just a perfect example if you opt to not test code because it was too hard.

16
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:49.072
It's not the testing that's hard, it's the configuration of that that's hard.

17
00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:53.387
Maybe it has a reference to JNDI or a database or some other things like that.

18
00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:54.393
More often than not,

19
00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.953
there is configuration code or code that doesn't have to deal with

20
00:00:56.953 --> 00:00:59.898
the normal flow of business logic that muddies up what you're

21
00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:02.821
trying to accomplish in your application.

22
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:04.880
We've already developed part of the application without Spring,

23
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.731
and now I'll show you how to configure that using

24
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:11.983
the Java configuration approach, then we'll move onto annotations,

25
00:01:11.983 --> 00:01:16.657
and, lastly, we'll briefly show the XML configuration method.

26
00:01:16.657 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's examine some of those pain points a little closer, though, before we dive in.
