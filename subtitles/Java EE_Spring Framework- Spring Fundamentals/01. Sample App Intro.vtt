00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.944
Let's dive into a little bit of the architecture of Spring and the

2
00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:08.069
application that we're going to build throughout this course.

3
00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.475
We'll walk through the basic project set up and a historical

4
00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:13.638
approach to what Spring solves for us.

5
00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:17.543
We're also going to build a small sample application in this module that

6
00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:20.433
will show you the concepts that Spring will help us with,

7
00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:28.000
and we're going to use that demo in all of the subsequent demos in the rest of this course.
