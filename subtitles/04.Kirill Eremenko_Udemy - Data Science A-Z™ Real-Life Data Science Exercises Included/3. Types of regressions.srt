1

00:00:00,690  -->  00:00:03,630
This whole section we'll be dealing with regressions quite a bit.

2

00:00:03,630  -->  00:00:08,730
So in today's tutorial we're going to talk about the different types of regressions we will be covering

3

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:09,520
off.

4

00:00:09,840  -->  00:00:11,020
This is how we keep media.

5

00:00:11,030  -->  00:00:16,590
It defines a regression in statistics regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the

6

00:00:16,590  -->  00:00:18,620
relationships among variables.

7

00:00:18,630  -->  00:00:23,400
The focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables

8

00:00:23,410  -->  00:00:23,590
.

9

00:00:23,760  -->  00:00:26,770
So let's look into this a bit more.

10

00:00:26,790  -->  00:00:31,560
They're going to look at two types of regressions in this part of the Course linear regression and the

11

00:00:31,560  -->  00:00:33,100
logistic regression.

12

00:00:33,230  -->  00:00:35,290
They both have two subtypes.

13

00:00:35,840  -->  00:00:40,860
The simple linear regression and the multiple in your regression and the simple logistic regression

14

00:00:40,890  -->  00:00:46,200
and the multiple Just vigorish And in terms of logistic regression.

15

00:00:47,280  -->  00:00:49,210
The distinction between simple and multiple.

16

00:00:49,290  -->  00:00:53,760
It's of course of course there but people rarely use a simple logistic regression.

17

00:00:53,760  -->  00:00:57,390
So whenever you hear a logistic regression it implies multiple.

18

00:00:57,480  -->  00:01:02,220
And moreover we can talk about logistic regression when write right when the time comes because we're

19

00:01:02,220  -->  00:01:03,870
not ready for that yet.

20

00:01:03,870  -->  00:01:10,710
So in this turtle is going to talk about a simple linear regression and will also cover off multiple

21

00:01:10,710  -->  00:01:14,660
integration in the in the next few tutorials as well a little bit.

22

00:01:14,910  -->  00:01:19,210
So simple in your regression and multiple introgression What are they.

23

00:01:19,380  -->  00:01:25,690
Well a simple integration is basically this formula where y equals zero plus B one times x.

24

00:01:25,710  -->  00:01:31,560
And you might recognize this formula from back in high school is just a formal over a trend line or

25

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:36,880
a slope sloped line on a x y axis.

26

00:01:37,140  -->  00:01:43,650
And let's go through these variables and coefficients one by one.

27

00:01:43,650  -->  00:01:51,420
So this is the dependent variable the dependent variable something you're trying to explain for instance

28

00:01:51,420  -->  00:01:55,740
how does a person's salary change with the years of experience that he has.

29

00:01:55,740  -->  00:02:02,820
So in that case why would be the dependent variable or how what grade does a student get depending on

30

00:02:02,820  -->  00:02:05,110
how much time he's put into studying.

31

00:02:05,170  -->  00:02:10,800
In that case why would be the dependent variable so something that you're trying to understand how it

32

00:02:10,800  -->  00:02:15,240
depends on something else X is your independent variable.

33

00:02:15,240  -->  00:02:18,200
In this case and the simple integration only have one independent variable.

34

00:02:18,330  -->  00:02:24,660
So we don't even have to call it X Y or we could just call it X and this is the variable that is.

35

00:02:24,720  -->  00:02:30,480
You're assuming that it is causing the depan variable to change or as we will learn further.

36

00:02:30,480  -->  00:02:34,890
Sometimes the independent variable might not be a direct causal factor but it's still there might be

37

00:02:34,890  -->  00:02:37,000
an implied association between the two.

38

00:02:37,230  -->  00:02:46,590
And in that case you're trying to figure out this association then B one is a coefficient for the independent

39

00:02:46,590  -->  00:02:47,220
variable.

40

00:02:47,280  -->  00:02:55,440
And it kind of says how the effect or how a change in X-1 a unit change in x1 and we'll be talking about

41

00:02:55,440  -->  00:02:56,250
this a lot.

42

00:02:56,250  -->  00:03:01,230
Unit changes a unit change in X-1 how that affects a unit change in Y.

43

00:03:01,230  -->  00:03:09,280
So it's kind of think of it as the translator or the multiplier or something like that that that connects

44

00:03:09,330  -->  00:03:15,480
to the connector between y and X-1 so you can just say you can always say X-1 is directly proportional

45

00:03:15,660  -->  00:03:16,740
there is.

46

00:03:17,130  -->  00:03:18,620
Well you can't just say.

47

00:03:18,840  -->  00:03:24,390
Why the change in x is always equal to change and why they might be at this coefficient of proportion

48

00:03:24,390  -->  00:03:28,980
to which proportion that change is inflated or deflated.

49

00:03:29,190  -->  00:03:35,310
And B zero is the constants as a constant term and we'll talk about the constant just in a few seconds

50

00:03:35,370  -->  00:03:39,440
or a few in a minute after we cut off the multiple integration.

51

00:03:39,720  -->  00:03:43,060
So multiple introgression same thing but many variables.

52

00:03:43,080  -->  00:03:51,540
So bizzarro one constant and then many combinations or many pairs of B and X and it can go up to quite

53

00:03:51,540  -->  00:03:56,630
a lot depends on how many regressors you have here on the you've got a dependent variable y.

54

00:03:56,640  -->  00:04:01,850
So something you're explaining but this time the difference is that you think there might be a few causations

55

00:04:01,890  -->  00:04:01,970
.

56

00:04:02,040  -->  00:04:07,770
So in the case of salary for instance it could be how much years of experience you've done how many

57

00:04:07,770  -->  00:04:16,380
other courses you've done and how much you know how much time you spend at work or things like that

58

00:04:16,380  -->  00:04:23,160
or how valuable how much money you make for the company in terms of a student and his grades.

59

00:04:23,160  -->  00:04:26,820
If you're depende verbal is what grade does the student get than in the independent variables could

60

00:04:26,820  -->  00:04:34,560
be how much the student has studied for the exam maybe how much he has slept before the exam how many

61

00:04:34,560  -->  00:04:39,490
lectures he has attended throughout the course and things like that.

62

00:04:39,600  -->  00:04:40,920
The concept is still there.

63

00:04:40,920  -->  00:04:42,960
And also you've got Tech officials.

64

00:04:42,960  -->  00:04:46,710
So now let's look at the simple linear regression because it's the easiest one to discuss.

65

00:04:46,710  -->  00:04:50,540
It's very pretty straightforward you can visualize it quite well.

66

00:04:50,550  -->  00:04:53,460
So here we got the y and x axis.

67

00:04:53,490  -->  00:04:56,640
Let's look at that specific example where we have experience and salary.

68

00:04:56,670  -->  00:04:58,830
So experience is going to be our horizontal axis.

69

00:04:58,830  -->  00:05:05,310
Salary is all vertical axis and we want to understand how people's salary depends on their experience

70

00:05:05,330  -->  00:05:05,530
.

71

00:05:05,670  -->  00:05:10,800
Well what we do in regression is we don't just come up with a theory we look at the evidence we'll look

72

00:05:10,800  -->  00:05:12,060
at the live hard fact.

73

00:05:12,060  -->  00:05:14,600
So here are some observations we've had.

74

00:05:14,610  -->  00:05:20,610
So in the CERN company this is how salaries are distributed among people who have different levels of

75

00:05:20,610  -->  00:05:23,540
experience and what a regression does.

76

00:05:23,670  -->  00:05:25,580
So that's a form of a regression.

77

00:05:25,620  -->  00:05:30,400
In our case it'll change to salary equals be 0 plus be 1 times experience.

78

00:05:30,660  -->  00:05:36,870
And what that essentially means is just putting a line through your chart that best fits this data and

79

00:05:36,870  -->  00:05:41,450
we'll talk about best fitting in the next toile when we're talking about ordinary squares.

80

00:05:41,520  -->  00:05:43,480
But for now this is the chart.

81

00:05:43,500  -->  00:05:46,740
This is the line that best fits as Darren even looks like it right.

82

00:05:46,740  -->  00:05:53,250
So I don't it's quite hard to draw a line that fits is not a better and assumption here is it's impossible

83

00:05:53,260  -->  00:05:57,720
this is the best line that approximates is not what does that mean.

84

00:05:57,720  -->  00:06:00,150
Well we'll talk about that in the next tutorial once again.

85

00:06:00,360  -->  00:06:05,670
For now let's focus on the coefficients and the coffin and the constant.

86

00:06:05,700  -->  00:06:07,650
So what does the constant mean here.

87

00:06:07,800  -->  00:06:15,030
Well the cause that actually means the the point where the line crosses the vertical axis and let's

88

00:06:15,030  -->  00:06:16,200
say it's $30000.

89

00:06:16,200  -->  00:06:16,860
What does that mean.

90

00:06:16,860  -->  00:06:19,830
Well it means that when B when experience is zero.

91

00:06:19,830  -->  00:06:25,530
So when as you say on the horizontal axis when experience is at 0 in the formula on the right you can

92

00:06:25,530  -->  00:06:31,950
see that the second part 1 times experience becomes zero so salary equals zero.

93

00:06:31,950  -->  00:06:38,760
That means that salary will equal to $30000 when a person has no experience so soon somebody is fresh

94

00:06:38,760  -->  00:06:40,740
from University and joins this company.

95

00:06:40,890  -->  00:06:44,220
Most likely they will have a salary about $30000.

96

00:06:44,340  -->  00:06:49,270
You know there will be some confidence intervals there but we won't go into that right now.

97

00:06:49,280  -->  00:06:55,510
Just we can say that according to this model that person will be probably getting paid $3000.

98

00:06:55,530  -->  00:06:59,180
Now what is be one big one is the slope of the line.

99

00:06:59,190  -->  00:07:06,810
And so the steeper the line the more you get more money you get per extra year of experience.

100

00:07:06,810  -->  00:07:07,460
Let's look at this.

101

00:07:07,500  -->  00:07:14,910
In this particular example let's say somebody went from maybe four to five years experience right.

102

00:07:14,910  -->  00:07:20,700
So then to understand how his salary increase you have to project this onto the line and then project

103

00:07:20,700  -->  00:07:28,200
that onto the salary access and you can see that here for one of your experience the person will get

104

00:07:28,290  -->  00:07:31,460
an extra ten thousand dollars on top of his salary.

105

00:07:31,590  -->  00:07:38,910
So if the coefficient P1 is less than the slope will be less and that means the salary increase will

106

00:07:38,910  -->  00:07:40,850
be less per every year of experience.

107

00:07:41,010  -->  00:07:50,640
If the slope is greater then that means the experience will yield more increase in salary and that's

108

00:07:50,640  -->  00:07:51,180
pretty much it.

109

00:07:51,180  -->  00:07:53,400
That's how a simple in your regression works.

110

00:07:53,400  -->  00:07:59,250
So the core goal here is that we're not just drawing a line theoretically that we can we came up with

111

00:07:59,250  -->  00:08:06,210
some how we're actually using observations that we have to find the best fitting line and what is best

112

00:08:06,210  -->  00:08:08,880
fitting line is we'll talk about that in the next tutorial
