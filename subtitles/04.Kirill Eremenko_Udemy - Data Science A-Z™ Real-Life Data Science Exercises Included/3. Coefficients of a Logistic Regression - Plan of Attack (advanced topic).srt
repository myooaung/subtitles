1

00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:01,890
Plan of attack.

2

00:00:01,890  -->  00:00:03,640
All right Carol what is this all about.

3

00:00:03,660  -->  00:00:04,590
What are we talking here.

4

00:00:04,590  -->  00:00:06,840
What kind of attack is going on.

5

00:00:07,110  -->  00:00:11,970
What are we going to be talking about in the next couple of tutorials is an advance topic and that's

6

00:00:11,970  -->  00:00:14,550
why the trolls are marked as advanced.

7

00:00:14,790  -->  00:00:18,550
And we will be looking at a very specific thing.

8

00:00:18,570  -->  00:00:19,650
Let me explain.

9

00:00:19,680  -->  00:00:22,460
Remember we previously talked about the do's and don'ts.

10

00:00:22,460  -->  00:00:24,290
All of a logistic regression.

11

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:32,190
And we specifically said that you cannot interpret magnitudes of the coefficients to quantify associations

12

00:00:32,190  -->  00:00:36,550
between the dependent variables and independent variables directly.

13

00:00:36,960  -->  00:00:41,130
And this is very different to a multiple linear regression.

14

00:00:41,130  -->  00:00:47,490
So this is a logistic regression here and we can't look at the magnitudes of these coefficients to compare

15

00:00:47,490  -->  00:00:48,950
the different variables between each other.

16

00:00:48,960  -->  00:00:55,170
We could totally do that in a multiple linear regression was very handy to tell us which independent

17

00:00:55,170  -->  00:01:01,350
variables are more are having more and more significant impact on the dependent variable and which are

18

00:01:01,350  -->  00:01:06,840
having less So basically comparing independent variables between each other and also actually quantifying

19

00:01:07,290  -->  00:01:14,100
physically quantifying the effect of the change in the independent variable and how that will affect

20

00:01:14,210  -->  00:01:16,650
the dependent variable.

21

00:01:16,650  -->  00:01:18,550
But here for logistic regression we can do that.

22

00:01:18,600  -->  00:01:23,410
And that just hurts that hurts so much we have to we have to be able to do it.

23

00:01:23,430  -->  00:01:30,480
And that is why we have this special part of the course the special couple of lectures or tutorials

24

00:01:31,140  -->  00:01:37,200
which are advanced because they will involve quite a bit of mathematics and some advanced understanding

25

00:01:37,260  -->  00:01:40,970
of possibilities and alteration and things like that.

26

00:01:41,220  -->  00:01:47,400
But if you can power through them with me I have broken them down into manageable sections or manageable

27

00:01:48,690  -->  00:01:51,980
topics which we will cover often and next to trolls.

28

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:56,850
And today is about setting that plan of attack and it's pretty pretty straightforward.

29

00:01:56,850  -->  00:02:00,400
So first we'll talk about the odds ratio.

30

00:02:00,510  -->  00:02:02,140
It's an important topic.

31

00:02:02,220  -->  00:02:08,550
You will see what odds are in sports betting So that's kind of like a side effect of this section of

32

00:02:08,550  -->  00:02:12,770
the Course you'll learn a bit more about odds in sports.

33

00:02:12,780  -->  00:02:19,440
But the main focus of this tutorial will be to link odds and probabilities.

34

00:02:19,440  -->  00:02:25,920
Then we'll talk about coefficient So this will be the math havey tutorial where we will actually understand

35

00:02:25,920  -->  00:02:34,260
how to plug ords into our logistic regression and then see for ourselves how a 1 unit change and occur

36

00:02:34,380  -->  00:02:40,330
in a independent variable translates through the coefficient into a change in the odds.

37

00:02:40,350  -->  00:02:46,320
So there's your hint wink wink into a change in the odds not in the possibility so that's going to be

38

00:02:46,320  -->  00:02:47,210
interesting.

39

00:02:47,220  -->  00:02:55,020
And then finally in the third tutorial after this plan of attack we will see the practical application

40

00:02:55,020  -->  00:02:55,070
.

41

00:02:55,110  -->  00:03:00,870
I will show you how to get the odds ratios and Grettel I will show you how to export everything into

42

00:03:00,870  -->  00:03:07,140
Excel how to prepare your report Excel and then actually how to put it into PowerPoint and the way I

43

00:03:07,140  -->  00:03:12,560
would go about presenting your logistic regression or your demographic segmentation to your manager

44

00:03:12,560  -->  00:03:12,690
.

45

00:03:12,690  -->  00:03:20,400
So we'll have a heat map and it'll be very very evident what the main insights are from our genome demographics

46

00:03:20,400  -->  00:03:27,510
competition and what the bank in this case what the banks should do in order to address the issue of

47

00:03:27,960  -->  00:03:29,660
increased churn.

48

00:03:30,030  -->  00:03:32,280
So it's going to be an exciting couple Torez.

49

00:03:32,310  -->  00:03:34,320
Bear in mind there are going to be advanced.

50

00:03:34,320  -->  00:03:36,740
So prepare yourself for some advanced mathematics.

51

00:03:36,870  -->  00:03:41,910
Well I wouldn't say good ones but some mathematics are going to be in there but we'll definitely part

52

00:03:41,910  -->  00:03:43,050
through them together.

53

00:03:43,260  -->  00:03:44,680
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

54

00:03:44,820  -->  00:03:46,500
Until then happy analyzing
