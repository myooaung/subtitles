1

00:00:00,750  -->  00:00:07,110
So I was wondering if you had noticed a minor little detail that changes when we modify a proc So when

2

00:00:07,110  -->  00:00:14,400
I right click the prok here and say modify there's one little thing that has changed compared to when

3

00:00:14,400  -->  00:00:17,020
you actually created the proc for the first time.

4

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:23,490
And that thing or that little detail is that this word used to be create when it first created the prologue

5

00:00:23,490  -->  00:00:23,520
.

6

00:00:23,520  -->  00:00:24,300
This was create.

7

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:25,450
Now it's alter.

8

00:00:25,530  -->  00:00:33,210
So I'll show you if I create a new proc here then the word is creates procedure so create has been replaced

9

00:00:33,210  -->  00:00:33,800
by faulter.

10

00:00:33,810  -->  00:00:34,650
So why's that.

11

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:37,940
Well that's because you cannot create the proc again.

12

00:00:37,950  -->  00:00:39,340
You can only modify it.

13

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:47,580
There's already an object with this name in our database with the name of a b l d w r k office supplies

14

00:00:47,580  -->  00:00:52,680
customer list so you can only alter so if I try putting create here and executing.

15

00:00:52,770  -->  00:01:01,660
I'll get an error saying that the object already exists and on the other hand if I delete the object

16

00:01:01,660  -->  00:01:09,480
so if I drop a delete here and then execute this script then everything goes fine and I refresh refresh

17

00:01:09,600  -->  00:01:15,390
the objects is there if I try to execute again I get an error because you can create something that

18

00:01:15,390  -->  00:01:16,140
already exists.

19

00:01:16,140  -->  00:01:22,770
You can only alter it so just so that you know if you want to after you've created it to modify it you

20

00:01:22,770  -->  00:01:24,540
type in the word alter here.

21

00:01:24,720  -->  00:01:28,950
Or if you right click and slide modify that is already set up for you.

22

00:01:28,960  -->  00:01:31,200
So the word alter is already present there.

23

00:01:31,860  -->  00:01:38,060
And what we're doing here is we can change the code that is stored in the procedure we execute the script

24

00:01:38,370  -->  00:01:41,940
and it'll be saved in our stored procedure so let's have a look at that.

25

00:01:42,060  -->  00:01:48,080
If I want to select a star from another table for instance we are soaking from custom lists.

26

00:01:48,090  -->  00:01:49,930
Let's look at transactional data.

27

00:01:50,220  -->  00:01:54,080
And now I execute this proc.

28

00:01:54,540  -->  00:01:57,620
So I've executed the proc and now I close it.

29

00:01:58,080  -->  00:02:04,410
And now I open it up again you can see that this new table has been saved and if I want to run the body

30

00:02:04,410  -->  00:02:07,680
of the proc and I highlight what I want to run I click execute.

31

00:02:07,920  -->  00:02:12,860
I select two tables or I can select one table I can select the other table if I want to.

32

00:02:13,080  -->  00:02:16,940
So you've have that freedom to do what you want inside.

33

00:02:17,010  -->  00:02:19,460
But the code has been saved for us.

34

00:02:19,630  -->  00:02:25,860
And so important a very important point here is that a lot of people when they start out with this blueprint

35

00:02:25,890  -->  00:02:30,500
they confuse the two things or they don't separate them.

36

00:02:30,510  -->  00:02:33,330
These are two completely separate things that you're doing.

37

00:02:33,360  -->  00:02:39,020
One is running the code two is saving the proc by running the whole script.

38

00:02:39,270  -->  00:02:46,710
So let me illustrate an example I want to change a proc again and let's say I want to select only the

39

00:02:46,710  -->  00:02:51,860
city column from the customer list table.

40

00:02:51,930  -->  00:02:53,840
Right so I've changed my code.

41

00:02:53,850  -->  00:02:54,720
I'm happy it.

42

00:02:54,720  -->  00:02:58,430
I've modified it and now I'm going to run it.

43

00:02:59,340  -->  00:03:03,070
And I get the results and then I'm happy so I go and put this into my report.

44

00:03:03,090  -->  00:03:08,250
I can I can tell the executives or whoever that now I know which cities the customers live in and so

45

00:03:08,250  -->  00:03:09,070
on.

46

00:03:09,720  -->  00:03:17,440
But then you know after a long day you have lots of tabs open up here and you know it's time to go home

47

00:03:17,440  -->  00:03:17,460
.

48

00:03:17,460  -->  00:03:18,020
So what do you do.

49

00:03:18,030  -->  00:03:19,520
Just close the SQL Server.

50

00:03:19,650  -->  00:03:23,340
OK maybe you don't maybe just want to close this tab so you close this tab.

51

00:03:23,340  -->  00:03:24,280
Or would you want to save it.

52

00:03:24,300  -->  00:03:31,200
Yeah I want to save it but then it offers you just saved this script as a text file or a scale file

53

00:03:31,200  -->  00:03:33,380
on your hard drive.

54

00:03:33,470  -->  00:03:37,520
You're not used to doing that you don't want to do that so you think oh actually I don't want to save

55

00:03:37,520  -->  00:03:37,780
it.

56

00:03:37,800  -->  00:03:42,930
That's right it's in approx it's stored over here so I'll just close it off and I won't so what happens

57

00:03:43,410  -->  00:03:47,690
now if I open up my Proc. it hasn't been saved.

58

00:03:47,820  -->  00:03:52,950
So the code inside doesn't mean say you change the code you put in a slick CD from this column from

59

00:03:52,950  -->  00:03:58,640
this table you deleted that table and you ran it so you got the result you want but you forgot to or

60

00:03:58,680  -->  00:04:01,540
the person forgot to save the proc itself.

61

00:04:01,560  -->  00:04:03,040
So there are two separate things.

62

00:04:03,090  -->  00:04:05,030
One thing is running the code here.

63

00:04:05,040  -->  00:04:13,540
So let's select let's look city again one is running the code here so if I highlight and run that runs

64

00:04:13,540  -->  00:04:20,310
the code for me and gives me a result that I want maybe creates a table maybe gives me a view of a table

65

00:04:20,340  -->  00:04:21,440
or something like that.

66

00:04:21,540  -->  00:04:26,940
But the other item that you need to remember about is running the whole proc.

67

00:04:26,940  -->  00:04:31,860
So now if I just click execute without highlighting and you think I'll see a message commands completed

68

00:04:31,860  -->  00:04:34,880
successfully and my proc has been updated.

69

00:04:34,890  -->  00:04:42,180
So now if I close this window before saving and I open my proc mortified you can see that it has been

70

00:04:42,180  -->  00:04:42,930
saved.

71

00:04:42,960  -->  00:04:46,580
So make sure to separate those two things.

72

00:04:46,590  -->  00:04:52,320
Another thing that I personally somehow got into the habit of doing is when I want to run the code I

73

00:04:52,320  -->  00:04:59,500
saw a select this code and I run execute and when I want to save the proc I highlight this bit and I

74

00:04:59,490  -->  00:05:01,720
run execute but I'm not going to do that.

75

00:05:01,720  -->  00:05:06,540
Now all Actually I will but I won't close this when what happens is it will alter the proc So basically

76

00:05:07,170  -->  00:05:15,330
I think the way I I got used to doing this is because here you have a command saying select and so you

77

00:05:15,330  -->  00:05:19,240
can see where this blue highlights started from you can see it's starts at the command.

78

00:05:19,250  -->  00:05:22,050
And I know that the command is to select.

79

00:05:22,050  -->  00:05:27,240
It's not going to change a proc and then just so that I don't forget I highlight this and I see that

80

00:05:27,250  -->  00:05:27,280
.

81

00:05:27,300  -->  00:05:32,640
OK so the command here is alter proc So I remember that this is going to actually change my approach

82

00:05:32,640  -->  00:05:32,860
.

83

00:05:32,910  -->  00:05:36,240
So if I run this it will save the prog but there's one little issue.

84

00:05:36,420  -->  00:05:38,360
So let's run that command.

85

00:05:38,360  -->  00:05:40,200
So it's a complete successfully.

86

00:05:40,200  -->  00:05:43,660
I'm not going to close this when I'm just going to modify the proc again.

87

00:05:43,740  -->  00:05:47,340
Here you can see that what happened is only this part got saved.

88

00:05:47,340  -->  00:05:52,650
The part above the Commons didn't get saved and I don't really like that I don't like that they get

89

00:05:52,860  -->  00:05:53,790
lost.

90

00:05:53,790  -->  00:06:02,610
So what I'm going to suggest for you is before you get your you know to use to this template let's change

91

00:06:02,610  -->  00:06:03,390
it up a little bit.

92

00:06:03,390  -->  00:06:05,250
So let's do it.

93

00:06:05,250  -->  00:06:08,260
How will I personally prefer doing it.

94

00:06:08,280  -->  00:06:13,200
And this is my recommendation to take this common section and drag it under the alter proc section.

95

00:06:13,200  -->  00:06:17,140
So now you have all this preparation which always is going to be there.

96

00:06:17,130  -->  00:06:18,150
That's not a problem.

97

00:06:18,360  -->  00:06:25,500
But now you're going to keep your comments under the alter proc header so it's inside your proc.

98

00:06:25,500  -->  00:06:32,040
And so now if you ever want to run your contents of your proc so your body then you highlight this bit

99

00:06:32,250  -->  00:06:38,190
and you execute you get your result if you want to save your proc you can run the whole script just

100

00:06:38,190  -->  00:06:40,220
by not highlighting anything like as a kid.

101

00:06:40,320  -->  00:06:45,360
But if you want to be like me and you want to be very specific so that in your you're visually you remember

102

00:06:45,360  -->  00:06:50,100
that you did save the proc then you highlight this and you click execute.

103

00:06:50,320  -->  00:06:58,110
And now if I if I can close this even not a problem if I open it up it's still there so the comments

104

00:06:58,200  -->  00:06:59,590
are saved and that's important.

105

00:06:59,610  -->  00:06:59,980
Important.

106

00:06:59,980  -->  00:07:02,870
Have these columns because my how important for mission.

107

00:07:03,360  -->  00:07:10,170
And so that is the two differences or the difference between saving your proc and running the body of

108

00:07:10,170  -->  00:07:16,050
the proc completely separate things you from Excel you're very or from other programs are very used

109

00:07:16,050  -->  00:07:16,340
to.

110

00:07:16,340  -->  00:07:21,750
Everybody's used to clicking the save button and saving the file in working with prox it's not done

111

00:07:21,750  -->  00:07:22,440
like that.

112

00:07:22,500  -->  00:07:26,570
You have to save the proc by highlighting this bit or running the whole script.

113

00:07:27,180  -->  00:07:29,960
And then if you want to run the proxy run what's inside the body.

114

00:07:30,240  -->  00:07:36,570
And so just to finish off everybody if one day you make this mistake you don't save a problem after

115

00:07:36,660  -->  00:07:38,700
working on it for a long time.

116

00:07:38,940  -->  00:07:47,910
It happens it's not it's it's not something that you can be immune to it's everybody goes through one

117

00:07:47,910  -->  00:07:49,480
or two of those cases.

118

00:07:49,620  -->  00:07:56,490
I remember my idea a couple of times I create a huge like or modified a huge model with thousands of

119

00:07:56,490  -->  00:08:02,760
lines of code and you know after a very long day you just just completely forgot to save the proc.

120

00:08:02,760  -->  00:08:07,890
And I just had the result the next day I just had the result of the model but I didn't have the model

121

00:08:07,890  -->  00:08:13,230
itself and it's pretty hectic when you get into those situations you have to reprogram everything from

122

00:08:13,230  -->  00:08:18,930
scratch and make sure the results match up so try not to get into those situations get into the habit

123

00:08:18,960  -->  00:08:24,880
of saving your prox before you close Asgill match server management studio.
