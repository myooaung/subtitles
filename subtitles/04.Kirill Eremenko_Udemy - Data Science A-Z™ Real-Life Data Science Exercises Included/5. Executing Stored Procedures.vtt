00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:06.450
Now which you stored procedure you will find that you can execute it without going into it.

2

00:00:06.450  -->  00:00:12.230
So I'm just in a closed room here and I can right click and here there is an option to exit keester

3

00:00:12.240  -->  00:00:14.770
procedure Silis click that and see what happens.

4

00:00:14.820  -->  00:00:18.450
It brings up a window and we're able to click OK here.

5

00:00:18.540  -->  00:00:24.110
So once we click OK what happens is the contents of the surplusage of the body of the stored procedure

6

00:00:24.120  -->  00:00:26.360
is executed and our table is selected.

7

00:00:26.430  -->  00:00:32.040
And then there's this return value because some stored procedures return values and by executing it

8

00:00:32.040  -->  00:00:35.270
that way you can also see what the return value is.

9

00:00:35.280  -->  00:00:42.540
This functionality is the proper way I guess to use stored procedures or the more advanced way of using

10

00:00:42.540  -->  00:00:51.990
stored procedures in Asgill and it's designed for people who use a skill on a daily basis or for looking

11

00:00:51.990  -->  00:00:58.540
after databases and for creating a certain process things like that it's not actually designed for that

12

00:00:58.600  -->  00:01:01.020
assigns work as data scientists.

13

00:01:01.020  -->  00:01:05.420
The main advantage of stored procedures for us is that it saves our code.

14

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:08.820
So by executing it like this we actually don't see what we're executing.

15

00:01:08.820  -->  00:01:13.220
We don't have that benefit of having the code in front of our eyes.

16

00:01:13.320  -->  00:01:18.390
So we're not going to exec is stored procedures like that only in some cases when we have for instance

17

00:01:18.480  -->  00:01:23.790
aggregated stored procedures but that is a bit more of an advanced topic and we don't need that right

18

00:01:23.790  -->  00:01:24.250
now.

19

00:01:24.480  -->  00:01:29.730
What we are going to do with this type of procedures we're going to every time when we want to run it

20

00:01:29.760  -->  00:01:35.280
when we want to perform the task that it performs for instance this stored procedure creates a will

21

00:01:35.340  -->  00:01:40.740
it will once we've set it up correctly it will create a working table from this table.

22

00:01:40.740  -->  00:01:47.280
So every time we want to run it we're going to open it click modify it and not for the intent of modifying

23

00:01:47.280  -->  00:01:56.670
it per se but for the intent of running it so then we know that the main code in the procedure is located

24

00:01:56.670  -->  00:01:57.180
in the body.

25

00:01:57.180  -->  00:02:02.640
So over here so every time we open it up which is going to highlight the code that we want to run and

26

00:02:02.640  -->  00:02:03.910
then will click execute.

27

00:02:03.990  -->  00:02:06.090
And that way we will get the result over here.

28

00:02:06.090  -->  00:02:12.750
So if it does create something like another table and then populates the table and so so that will happen

29

00:02:13.230  -->  00:02:19.680
once you select this code and you run it once again the main advantage of stored procedures for us is

30

00:02:19.680  -->  00:02:24.820
not that you can set it up and then it every time I interrupted you just right click and run.

31

00:02:24.990  -->  00:02:29.910
The main advantage of stored procedures for data science is the fact that you can type in your code

32

00:02:29.910  -->  00:02:38.160
between Begin and End and your code will be saved and you will be able to view it modify it rerun it

33

00:02:38.160  -->  00:02:39.000
whenever you need.

34

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:46.280
So it's a storage facility for us for our code for the results of our work.

35

00:02:46.290  -->  00:02:49.130
So that's how we're going to be using stored procedures going forward
