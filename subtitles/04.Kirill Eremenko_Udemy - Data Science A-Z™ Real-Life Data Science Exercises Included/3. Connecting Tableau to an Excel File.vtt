00:00:00.570  -->  00:00:02.460
Another we have downloaded Aldora.

2

00:00:02.520  -->  00:00:07.060
Let's get Tablo fired up and we can start this analysis.

3

00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:10.900
So we going to connect to fall and this is going to be an Excel file.

4

00:00:11.160  -->  00:00:19.650
And here we will select the father we downloaded click open and as you can see here there was only one

5

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:20.110
tab.

6

00:00:20.130  -->  00:00:23.830
So Tablo chose it by default if you have several tabs in your Excel file.

7

00:00:23.820  -->  00:00:29.710
They'll be all listed over here and here you can scroll through just check everything is OK.

8

00:00:29.790  -->  00:00:31.100
Everything looks fine.

9

00:00:31.110  -->  00:00:33.110
We've got all 10000 recruits here.

10

00:00:33.350  -->  00:00:34.230
And that's pretty much it.

11

00:00:34.230  -->  00:00:37.630
So we've connected the file to Tablo.

12

00:00:37.890  -->  00:00:44.820
Now what we can do is do some you know some something interesting here while while we're here as you

13

00:00:44.820  -->  00:00:50.190
can see we've got geographies so how about we visualize a map of our customers and see where they're

14

00:00:50.190  -->  00:00:50.810
from.

15

00:00:51.060  -->  00:00:56.780
So if we drag geography onto this area we expect a map but nothing happens.

16

00:00:56.790  -->  00:01:00.080
We only get a column with the different geographies.

17

00:01:00.090  -->  00:01:01.040
So why is that.

18

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:05.420
Was this action different to the one we undertook previously.

19

00:01:05.420  -->  00:01:06.280
No.

20

00:01:06.390  -->  00:01:08.160
First Tauriel while Tablo.

21

00:01:08.430  -->  00:01:14.250
Well the reason is because geography here isn't recognized as an actual geography by tablas being recognized

22

00:01:14.280  -->  00:01:20.850
as a textfield and you can tell by the ABC label over here on the left so we can very easily fix that

23

00:01:20.850  -->  00:01:20.970
.

24

00:01:20.970  -->  00:01:24.050
If you go to geography and you could just drop down.

25

00:01:24.420  -->  00:01:27.540
And here you select Geographic crawl.

26

00:01:27.690  -->  00:01:32.940
And because we know from what we see in our business right now we see that it's a country.

27

00:01:32.940  -->  00:01:35.490
So how about we select country region over here.

28

00:01:35.940  -->  00:01:39.980
Now we're going to just get rid of geography and do that action again.

29

00:01:40.140  -->  00:01:41.950
As you can see it's changed to globe.

30

00:01:42.030  -->  00:01:46.650
So it's no longer ABC it's a globe meaning that is being recognized as a geographic.

31

00:01:46.650  -->  00:01:51.600
And also there's latitude and longitude Conon columns that have been generated for us.

32

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:56.630
So we geography into the middle this time we see a map.

33

00:01:57.030  -->  00:02:03.320
So I'll make some space I'll make this map a bit smaller so we can zoom in a little bit.

34

00:02:03.330  -->  00:02:04.280
All right.

35

00:02:04.530  -->  00:02:11.560
Now what we want to do is we want to get rid of these dots and change them into an actual color.

36

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:14.640
So color the countries that our customers are from.

37

00:02:14.700  -->  00:02:17.010
And in order to there we have to select a measure.

38

00:02:17.160  -->  00:02:22.920
And I would like to know how many customers I have in each country and because I know that and my daughter

39

00:02:22.920  -->  00:02:27.800
said every single role was a new customer what I can do is I can use number of records.

40

00:02:27.990  -->  00:02:32.730
That way it will double will visualize the number of rows that are associated with each country.

41

00:02:32.730  -->  00:02:40.260
So I'm going take number of records and drag it onto color and right away you can see that our colors

42

00:02:40.260  -->  00:02:41.310
have appeared.

43

00:02:41.310  -->  00:02:46.980
Now we can tell that most customers came from France and about the same amounts came from Germany and

44

00:02:46.980  -->  00:02:47.500
Spain.

45

00:02:47.560  -->  00:02:48.600
But we don't know exactly.

46

00:02:48.600  -->  00:02:52.700
So what we need to do is add a label to add a label.

47

00:02:52.770  -->  00:02:58.560
We're going to go to a number of records again and we are going to drag it on to label.

48

00:02:58.980  -->  00:03:01.330
So now I'll zoom in a little bit.

49

00:03:01.410  -->  00:03:04.480
Actually it's a bit too much so I'll keep it like that.

50

00:03:04.590  -->  00:03:07.430
I want to increase the size of the text.

51

00:03:07.470  -->  00:03:12.760
I'll just click a label dropdown down here and maybe make it 14.

52

00:03:12.960  -->  00:03:14.810
Maybe that's maybe that's a bit too much.

53

00:03:14.810  -->  00:03:16.110
Make it to 12 and they can.

54

00:03:16.110  -->  00:03:16.680
Bold.

55

00:03:16.800  -->  00:03:20.640
So that is how many customers we have in each country.

56

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:27.420
And if you want to zoom in specifically you can select a region here and you can do like a zoom area

57

00:03:27.420  -->  00:03:30.530
like that and you select what you want to zoom into.

58

00:03:30.930  -->  00:03:36.630
OK so here we can see that most of our customers are from France approximately half actually more than

59

00:03:36.630  -->  00:03:38.970
half because we only have 10000 records.

60

00:03:38.970  -->  00:03:45.210
And Germany and Spain have the same number of customers so that's just a basic thing to check about

61

00:03:45.210  -->  00:03:53.160
our data and in the next tutorial we will start actually performing the data mining tasks.

62

00:03:53.160  -->  00:03:54.560
And I look forward seeing you next time.

63

00:03:54.600  -->  00:03:56.220
Until then happy analyzing
