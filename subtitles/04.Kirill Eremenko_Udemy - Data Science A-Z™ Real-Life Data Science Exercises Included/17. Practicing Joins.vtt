00:00:00.870  -->  00:00:01.190
All right.

2

00:00:01.190  -->  00:00:03.530
So we learn everything we need to know about joins.

3

00:00:03.540  -->  00:00:05.240
Let's do some practice.

4

00:00:05.250  -->  00:00:09.960
We're going to take a list of orders table and we're going to take our order break down table.

5

00:00:10.200  -->  00:00:18.450
Now if we put this one to the side you will see here that in this table we have all of the orders that

6

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:20.970
were conducted and in this table we have their breakdown.

7

00:00:20.970  -->  00:00:25.720
So basically this means that somebody might have bought several items in their order.

8

00:00:25.860  -->  00:00:32.340
For instance this order consists of at least three items a shelf thumbtacks and some lockers.

9

00:00:32.520  -->  00:00:36.660
And we want to match these items to their associate order.

10

00:00:36.780  -->  00:00:39.090
So as you can understand this is going to be a left join.

11

00:00:39.150  -->  00:00:43.530
We're going to be joining this table with this table this one's going to be on the left and it's going

12

00:00:43.530  -->  00:00:44.510
to be LEFT JOIN.

13

00:00:44.670  -->  00:00:51.750
And as we discussed in one of the previous tutorials because these rows are duplicated here what's going

14

00:00:51.750  -->  00:00:58.470
to happen is they're going to roll the associated records in this table are also going to be duplicated

15

00:00:58.470  -->  00:01:03.400
to match the number of rows for each of those records in this table.

16

00:01:03.810  -->  00:01:06.240
And let's get straight into it.

17

00:01:06.240  -->  00:01:08.270
So I'm going to close this.

18

00:01:08.430  -->  00:01:12.540
We just need to remember that the name of the column is Order ID we're joining on call call word.

19

00:01:12.580  -->  00:01:18.390
I'm actually going to copy that close that close that let's start an inquiry at the top we're going

20

00:01:18.390  -->  00:01:20.240
to type in use D.S. training.

21

00:01:20.320  -->  00:01:28.340
Then go and then it will start a query selects start from what's the table name list of orders.

22

00:01:28.680  -->  00:01:31.800
So it's put brackets a list of orders

23

00:01:34.230  -->  00:01:38.280
left join in order breakdown

24

00:01:41.670  -->  00:01:44.480
and what you want to join on on.

25

00:01:45.150  -->  00:01:47.690
So the column name is Order ID.

26

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:54.590
So I'm just going to copy this list of orders Daut Order ID equals order breakdown and the code name

27

00:01:54.600  -->  00:02:02.820
there is the same order ID so far on this now as you can see we've got the first table that's it up

28

00:02:02.820  -->  00:02:03.150
to there.

29

00:02:03.150  -->  00:02:06.640
That's the first table and then the second table.

30

00:02:07.140  -->  00:02:10.310
And so here you can see let's find one the duplicate there.

31

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:16.450
So this order consisted of three products books card printer and a headset.

32

00:02:16.800  -->  00:02:21.610
And it was matched to this at least actually through products it might be.

33

00:02:21.690  -->  00:02:23.350
It might come up somewhere else as well.

34

00:02:23.370  -->  00:02:27.440
So it was matched to this order to the actual order here.

35

00:02:27.480  -->  00:02:34.050
And so the records in this table they got replicated several times to match these record so this is

36

00:02:34.320  -->  00:02:37.810
an example of exactly what we're talking about in the previous tutorials.

37

00:02:37.810  -->  00:02:41.290
A live example let's have a look at another one.

38

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:47.070
So this order 6:9 if it might come up somewhere else here.

39

00:02:47.070  -->  00:02:52.920
But for now we can see that it was in this table obviously it was once in this record was present this

40

00:02:52.920  -->  00:02:54.990
table was because the everything was unique.

41

00:02:54.990  -->  00:03:01.890
These Order ID is a unique column in this first table and this table was present at least at least four

42

00:03:01.890  -->  00:03:02.630
times.

43

00:03:02.700  -->  00:03:08.510
And in this order we had an index tab Locker's printer and a phone.

44

00:03:08.700  -->  00:03:18.210
And therefore this record got replicated several times to match the number of records in this table

45

00:03:18.210  -->  00:03:24.610
so that now we have all these nice pretty columns with all of the data as we wanted.

46

00:03:24.780  -->  00:03:27.800
Now I'll show you one more thing here.

47

00:03:27.930  -->  00:03:31.140
This is quite a clutch.

48

00:03:31.140  -->  00:03:37.290
It's a lot of clutter to write your table name out every time so there's a faster way you can give your

49

00:03:37.290  -->  00:03:45.300
tables aliases so if you say from a list of orders after you say as a and from left join order break

50

00:03:45.300  -->  00:03:52.700
down as B then you can take the A and replace the name here with a and take the B and replace the name

51

00:03:52.710  -->  00:03:56.520
here with B and if you run this now you'll get exactly the same result.

52

00:03:56.520  -->  00:04:01.650
So after you say something as a skill knows that in this query.

53

00:04:01.650  -->  00:04:06.510
From now on you can everything wherever wherever it sees a.

54

00:04:06.810  -->  00:04:12.780
It actually will replace it with this name of this table and for you just it's visually better and it's

55

00:04:12.780  -->  00:04:14.890
faster to type and you call.

56

00:04:14.970  -->  00:04:21.690
It's like it's harder to get confused because there's less text on your your query.

57

00:04:21.690  -->  00:04:30.030
Also you can just get rid of the as just type in list of orders a order break down be a skill will understand

58

00:04:30.030  -->  00:04:31.530
that you're saying as.

59

00:04:31.530  -->  00:04:33.770
And if you run this query same thing.

60

00:04:33.810  -->  00:04:39.030
So that's a shortcut that I always use and you should get into the habit of using because it will save

61

00:04:39.030  -->  00:04:42.780
you lots and lots of time and that's how you do joins.

62

00:04:42.780  -->  00:04:45.710
So maybe experiment with that a little bit.

63

00:04:45.710  -->  00:04:49.960
See what happens if you do an inner join if you are right join the dots.

64

00:04:49.980  -->  00:04:56.280
There you know play around see what you can do and just practice your joining.

65

00:04:56.280  -->  00:05:00.620
We might need to further down in this course.
