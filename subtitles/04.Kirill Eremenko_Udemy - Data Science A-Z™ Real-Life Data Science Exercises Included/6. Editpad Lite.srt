Edit pad life is a paid program is similar to notepad plus plus but has some additional advantages.

2

00:00:05,820  -->  00:00:11,940
The descriptions both say that notepad plus plus and edit pad light work well with files under two gigabytes

3

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:12,160
.

4

00:00:12,240  -->  00:00:18,660
However I find that notepad plus plus sometimes struggles but edit but lights always works really well

5

00:00:18,690  -->  00:00:21,770
and much faster with very large files.

6

00:00:21,930  -->  00:00:27,140
Also edit pad light is definitely much Vasa and excel when it comes to very big CACP files.

7

00:00:27,270  -->  00:00:32,400
So if you're struggling opening your data sans file with Excel or even notepad plus plus then you should

8

00:00:32,400  -->  00:00:35,070
consider giving it a bad light a go.

9

00:00:35,070  -->  00:00:40,770
Also if you have a file well over two gigabytes that you need to investigate there is always a more

10

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:48,270
expensive version edit pad pro with its advanced features and extra bonuses that edit pad light is free

11

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:49,430
for personal use.

12

00:00:49,440  -->  00:00:54,710
So if you're working on some of your personal projects at home you can get it at no charge.

13

00:00:54,720  -->  00:00:58,920
If however you intend to use it for work then you need to purchase a license.

14

00:00:58,920  -->  00:01:03,830
Personally I like the user interface in Notepad plus plus I'm much more and is free.

15

00:01:03,870  -->  00:01:08,520
I recommend sticking with notepad plus plus but keeping edit pad light in mind in case you ever need

16

00:01:08,520  -->  00:01:09,880
additional power.
