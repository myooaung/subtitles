00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:04.130
Today we're going to start of first thought upload project and SOSIAS.

2

00:00:04.140  -->  00:00:07.140
This is going to be a really fun tutorial and you'll learn a lot.

3

00:00:07.140  -->  00:00:08.270
Let's get straight into it.

4

00:00:08.490  -->  00:00:15.570
First of all let's launch the Visual Studio shall now select new project here on the left under business

5

00:00:15.570  -->  00:00:22.950
intelligence find the integration services project option give your project a name and in terms of location

6

00:00:22.980  -->  00:00:25.250
I usually use the default folder.

7

00:00:25.380  -->  00:00:31.140
You're welcome to use a project folder however you might find it challenging because if the folder path

8

00:00:31.140  -->  00:00:34.570
is too long you will get an error like this.

9

00:00:34.890  -->  00:00:37.560
So we will stick with the default folder.

10

00:00:37.980  -->  00:00:39.320
Click OK.

11

00:00:39.620  -->  00:00:44.960
Get rid of this getting started window and your project is ready to go.

12

00:00:45.090  -->  00:00:49.320
As you can see there are lots of different controls which may seem overwhelming at first.

13

00:00:49.320  -->  00:00:51.650
Hope we won't be using all of them.

14

00:00:51.690  -->  00:00:53.280
We will focus on two main things.

15

00:00:53.280  -->  00:00:58.620
The middle section which is your main workspace and the Sosias tool box on the left at the top of your

16

00:00:58.620  -->  00:00:59.560
main section.

17

00:00:59.580  -->  00:01:01.670
You will see 5 categories.

18

00:01:01.710  -->  00:01:02.990
Forget about the last three.

19

00:01:03.000  -->  00:01:07.650
You will only be working with the first two control flow and data flow.

20

00:01:07.650  -->  00:01:12.240
Now let's go to the toolbox and find the data flow task.

21

00:01:12.240  -->  00:01:19.200
Drag it into your main working area and you have created a doubtful task Congratulations.

22

00:01:19.230  -->  00:01:20.240
It's as simple as that.

23

00:01:20.250  -->  00:01:23.610
All of your work in SSA S will be drag and drop.

24

00:01:23.610  -->  00:01:27.830
Now if we double click on the data flow task we are taken to the data flow window.

25

00:01:28.140  -->  00:01:33.060
In simple terms you can think of this as a control flow being the process that kickstarts the data flow

26

00:01:33.060  -->  00:01:33.430
.

27

00:01:33.540  -->  00:01:36.020
So there's a certain hierarchy between the two.

28

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:42.140
The data flow is where you will specify which files need to be uploaded and where they go.

29

00:01:42.290  -->  00:01:45.700
You will start setting up all sources and destinations in the next to Tauriel
