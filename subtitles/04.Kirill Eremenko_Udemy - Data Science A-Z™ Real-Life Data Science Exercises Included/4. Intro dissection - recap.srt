1

00:00:00,810  -->  00:00:01,860
So how did you enjoy that.

2

00:00:01,860  -->  00:00:04,750
Did you find the intro to the presentation interesting.

3

00:00:04,890  -->  00:00:10,890
It was pretty cool how we added some comments along the way so I wrote them written down here and let's

4

00:00:10,890  -->  00:00:14,850
go through them one by one just so that we were definitely covering everything.

5

00:00:14,850  -->  00:00:17,590
So the big one was lots of arms and yeah.

6

00:00:17,880  -->  00:00:18,350
That's true.

7

00:00:18,360  -->  00:00:21,080
I was a bit nervous and nobody's perfect.

8

00:00:21,150  -->  00:00:24,190
I'm still learning how to present especially to live audiences.

9

00:00:24,390  -->  00:00:30,000
So but definitely you would want to take them out of your presentation and practice to get rid of all

10

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:37,710
these arms and butts and extra words that are not supposed to be the number two overall outline of what

11

00:00:37,710  -->  00:00:45,620
will be discussed so at the start you could hear me say or you say to the audience exactly what we're

12

00:00:45,630  -->  00:00:46,610
going to be talking about.

13

00:00:46,620  -->  00:00:52,860
And it is a major data science project so get them excited to tell them that this is like a major success

14

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:53,510
and downsides.

15

00:00:53,800  -->  00:00:57,520
And then right away we talk about the journey so you could see me right away.

16

00:00:57,520  -->  00:01:01,050
Outlie early on what the journey will be.

17

00:01:01,050  -->  00:01:03,410
Actually I actually said the word journey.

18

00:01:03,420  -->  00:01:08,480
I want to take you on a journey and that is what downsized presentations are about.

19

00:01:08,490  -->  00:01:13,380
We'll talk more about this in the next trial but in short you don't want to give them the hard facts

20

00:01:13,380  -->  00:01:17,970
you want to take them on a journey so that they feel that they are part of something inside.

21

00:01:18,270  -->  00:01:24,560
Like a they're engaged in it they're they're feeling emotions as you go along through the presentations

22

00:01:24,560  -->  00:01:24,630
.

23

00:01:24,630  -->  00:01:28,470
That's what it's all about and says it's OK to say at the start you want to take them on the journey

24

00:01:28,490  -->  00:01:29,150
.

25

00:01:29,190  -->  00:01:31,420
I use that trick all the time.

26

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:34,210
In fact I'm taking you on a journey right now.

27

00:01:34,830  -->  00:01:37,980
Number four explain what they will learn.

28

00:01:38,040  -->  00:01:40,490
Highlight what's the value they will get from this.

29

00:01:40,620  -->  00:01:47,730
So you could hear me say at the start that I will tell them what data science is what data data mining

30

00:01:47,730  -->  00:01:51,540
is all about and how they can use their daughter to help their business.

31

00:01:51,540  -->  00:01:56,850
So I outlined exactly what they're getting from this presentation and why they should listen to it.

32

00:01:56,850  -->  00:02:01,290
So what they will have at the end and I delivered on that so that's important to outline and then to

33

00:02:01,340  -->  00:02:08,300
deliberately get them engaged early on e.g. make them laugh so and the other one is get them engaged

34

00:02:08,300  -->  00:02:09,720
or don't ask it ask the question.

35

00:02:09,720  -->  00:02:12,020
So that's important.

36

00:02:12,030  -->  00:02:15,970
If you if you want people like people have short attention spans these days.

37

00:02:16,110  -->  00:02:20,490
Some people say that human beings are the invention of iPhones.

38

00:02:20,490  -->  00:02:22,620
Now we have like attention spans.

39

00:02:22,830  -->  00:02:26,400
One second less than a goldfish something or something ridiculous.

40

00:02:26,400  -->  00:02:29,190
But anyway people have short attention spans.

41

00:02:29,190  -->  00:02:30,960
You want to increase their attention span.

42

00:02:30,960  -->  00:02:35,860
How do you do that you wake them up you get them get their brains working stimulated you make them focus

43

00:02:35,890  -->  00:02:40,260
so when you're talking maybe or not they're listening to you maybe they're somewhere else.

44

00:02:40,350  -->  00:02:41,850
But if you ask a question right.

45

00:02:41,850  -->  00:02:43,720
So the first one was make them laugh right.

46

00:02:43,740  -->  00:02:48,210
When people hear other people around them laughing like whoa what's happening is if they were zoned

47

00:02:48,210  -->  00:02:49,550
out they'd get back in there.

48

00:02:49,550  -->  00:02:54,430
So it's a good idea if you can make a joke like the one I used was.

49

00:02:54,870  -->  00:02:59,130
You're going to become data scientists for the next 15 minutes or so and I find it pretty exciting so

50

00:02:59,420  -->  00:03:01,470
that you know I really did find that exciting.

51

00:03:01,470  -->  00:03:06,390
So it's the truth and at the same time they found it funny because none of them are data scientists

52

00:03:06,420  -->  00:03:09,330
or anything that goes by the way I should've mentioned this earlier.

53

00:03:09,330  -->  00:03:15,150
There was a completely non-technical audience so those were executives very high level audience have

54

00:03:15,150  -->  00:03:16,440
no idea about dollar signs.

55

00:03:16,500  -->  00:03:22,950
Some of them were this was the first time they heard about dollar signs and yet I did my best to get

56

00:03:22,950  -->  00:03:26,220
them engaged and break it down for them so they could follow along.

57

00:03:26,610  -->  00:03:27,860
So making them laugh.

58

00:03:27,930  -->  00:03:28,800
That's perfect.

59

00:03:28,800  -->  00:03:32,630
If you can make the audience laugh you're winning them over and you know you're not.

60

00:03:32,670  -->  00:03:33,800
You don't want to fight them.

61

00:03:33,810  -->  00:03:35,140
You want to be on their side.

62

00:03:35,150  -->  00:03:36,990
You want them to be on your side.

63

00:03:37,440  -->  00:03:45,300
You want them to be opened up so that you can you know put knowledge into their minds or get engaged

64

00:03:45,300  -->  00:03:48,000
get them engaged early on ask questions so ask the questions.

65

00:03:48,000  -->  00:03:54,210
Other techniques that you can use even especially works with far smaller boardroom so it is harder to

66

00:03:54,210  -->  00:03:54,900
make.

67

00:03:54,900  -->  00:03:57,600
Like it is hard to make a small audience laugh.

68

00:03:57,600  -->  00:04:00,950
They have like five people or even three people one to one.

69

00:04:00,990  -->  00:04:04,990
It's harder to make them laugh and it's easier to make a large audience laugh.

70

00:04:05,160  -->  00:04:08,880
But at the same time it's you can always ask a question.

71

00:04:09,060  -->  00:04:11,300
It's even easier to answer a question of a small audience.

72

00:04:11,400  -->  00:04:14,180
Right so because you can dress people individually.

73

00:04:14,300  -->  00:04:19,350
So if you ask a question that gets them thinking that gets them you know creates a silence creates a

74

00:04:19,420  -->  00:04:24,810
pause and they start feeling maybe a little bit uncomfortable so you have to be you have to be comfortable

75

00:04:25,320  -->  00:04:29,010
with the fact that there's a bit of silence and a little silence doesn't you know doesn't ruin anything

76

00:04:29,400  -->  00:04:31,620
even if nobody answers your question we'll just move on.

77

00:04:31,770  -->  00:04:38,340
But if you do get them to put their hand up like in my example ask the question I said How can people

78

00:04:38,340  -->  00:04:41,770
who are not familiar with this concept of this campaign which is called The Superman.

79

00:04:41,790  -->  00:04:42,900
Can you please put your hand up.

80

00:04:43,140  -->  00:04:45,170
And that's all I ask for putting their hand up.

81

00:04:45,180  -->  00:04:47,460
And some people did like it.

82

00:04:47,460  -->  00:04:52,110
At first nobody did because it's always a bit scary to put your hand up first but then some people did

83

00:04:52,110  -->  00:04:56,490
put their hands up and that got the audience engaged and I pointed that out and I said thank you thank

84

00:04:56,490  -->  00:05:03,000
you for putting your hand up like because I want to reward that engagement that they're you know exhibiting

85

00:05:03,360  -->  00:05:07,180
a lot of behavioral stuff going on in the background like psychological stuff.

86

00:05:07,170  -->  00:05:13,230
So you want to reward that engagement so that others subconsciously want to be more engaged in your

87

00:05:13,230  -->  00:05:15,290
presentation as well.

88

00:05:15,360  -->  00:05:20,490
Actually what I wanted to say here is Tony Robbins I'm sure you've heard of Tony Robbins.

89

00:05:20,490  -->  00:05:24,620
Robbins he does a really good job of engaging the audience.

90

00:05:24,630  -->  00:05:30,270
And I'll put a link to one of his TED talks that I really like I'll put it in the tutorial with the

91

00:05:30,270  -->  00:05:31,580
links at the end of the section.

92

00:05:31,710  -->  00:05:32,750
So make sure to check it out.

93

00:05:32,750  -->  00:05:34,490
Talk about Dallasites at all.

94

00:05:34,530  -->  00:05:39,240
It's about motivationally you might actually pick up some cool stuff from there about motivation but

95

00:05:39,300  -->  00:05:45,990
at the same time he does a really good job engaging audiences making them you know responds to his requests

96

00:05:46,020  -->  00:05:49,700
making them feel excited about what he's presenting.

97

00:05:49,830  -->  00:05:56,070
So that's that's a very good place to learn some good to meet the other one was make sure everybody's

98

00:05:56,070  -->  00:05:56,670
on the same page.

99

00:05:56,670  -->  00:05:58,160
So that's the other thing I did.

100

00:05:58,390  -->  00:06:02,510
Because you do present technical things we do tend to plan technical things.

101

00:06:02,640  -->  00:06:03,960
Your audiences might be different.

102

00:06:03,960  -->  00:06:08,490
Right so they might be really prepared to some level of about what you're presenting maybe they're the

103

00:06:08,490  -->  00:06:12,330
people that ordered this project and they were you know a lot of the foundations so you don't have to

104

00:06:12,330  -->  00:06:17,430
explain it but do make sure that everybody knows where you're starting from and that's what I did in

105

00:06:17,430  -->  00:06:18,070
this presentation.

106

00:06:18,090  -->  00:06:24,000
I asked that if everybody knows what a superman campaign is because that was the basis of what was going

107

00:06:24,000  -->  00:06:27,420
to talk about and I wanted to make sure even There's like three people in the audience and don't know

108

00:06:27,840  -->  00:06:28,980
I tell them about it.

109

00:06:29,010  -->  00:06:35,330
And that allows you to refresh the memories of the other people about this specific topic.

110

00:06:35,340  -->  00:06:36,950
All right so what else do we have.

111

00:06:37,030  -->  00:06:37,930
Number eight was.

112

00:06:37,940  -->  00:06:41,560
Use your eyes to connect with people with multiple people when you talk.

113

00:06:41,580  -->  00:06:45,710
So it's a it's a very powerful.

114

00:06:45,920  -->  00:06:51,420
I connection I contact a lot of data scientists and analysts.

115

00:06:51,420  -->  00:06:55,200
They lack this right because we don't come from creative backgrounds.

116

00:06:55,200  -->  00:06:58,020
Normally we don't come from arts and crafts and so on.

117

00:06:58,020  -->  00:07:02,910
We come from way more of a technical background like I'm sure you can associate or relate to this.

118

00:07:03,120  -->  00:07:07,980
And we're a lot of wow thinking is a left brain thinking right.

119

00:07:07,980  -->  00:07:11,280
Well most of the time we're inside ourselves.

120

00:07:11,280  -->  00:07:13,350
A lot of us are introverts right.

121

00:07:13,380  -->  00:07:17,770
We look at the ground like I used to find myself always like when I'm talking to people I'm looking

122

00:07:17,770  -->  00:07:21,880
at the ground where I'm walking the street I'm looking at the ground level and kind of like in Saigon

123

00:07:21,930  -->  00:07:27,000
thoughts nothing wrong with that but you don't get to connect with the audience and it's a skill you

124

00:07:27,000  -->  00:07:27,770
have to develop.

125

00:07:27,770  -->  00:07:33,080
You have to push yourself to look at the person you're talking to don't don't stare don't make it awkward

126

00:07:33,420  -->  00:07:37,580
but connects through eye contact especially if somebody is talking to you.

127

00:07:37,710  -->  00:07:39,100
You can look in their eyes.

128

00:07:39,230  -->  00:07:44,100
And that way you can make better when you're talking to an audience whether it's five people 200 people

129

00:07:44,100  -->  00:07:44,370
.

130

00:07:44,370  -->  00:07:49,380
Make sure you're looking at one person then another person another that don't stare at just one person

131

00:07:49,380  -->  00:07:51,960
all the time because other people feel alienated.

132

00:07:51,960  -->  00:07:57,690
If you move your eyes around the audience or pick one two three or five people that you that are looking

133

00:07:57,690  -->  00:08:02,580
at you as well and just look at them once in a while so move your focus around so people can see that

134

00:08:03,180  -->  00:08:05,240
you're engaging everybody.

135

00:08:05,250  -->  00:08:08,570
That's that's a good technique that I picked up along the way as well.

136

00:08:09,000  -->  00:08:18,010
And finally use intonation and to add emphasis to important parts and also pauses so intonation and

137

00:08:18,010  -->  00:08:22,410
pauses how you raise your voice how you lower your voice when you're talking about important things

138

00:08:22,470  -->  00:08:25,750
or when you speed up when you want to get some somethings.

139

00:08:25,860  -->  00:08:30,520
Go through some things quickly or slow down when something is very very important.

140

00:08:30,540  -->  00:08:32,630
So things like that that's a very powerful technique.

141

00:08:32,640  -->  00:08:37,290
Why why are we focusing on all these like definitely can pick up a lot of these techniques from a book

142

00:08:37,290  -->  00:08:38,630
on presenting something like that.

143

00:08:38,670  -->  00:08:45,410
But I've highlighted the ones that you saw me actually use right and also is because data science is

144

00:08:45,420  -->  00:08:52,410
complicated and you've got to break it down to be very simple like like like it if you're reading a

145

00:08:52,410  -->  00:08:53,450
book to a child right.

146

00:08:53,460  -->  00:08:56,070
You're not going to you're going to make it interesting.

147

00:08:56,070  -->  00:08:59,690
You don't just get to read through it like it's a fact you're going to make it interesting.

148

00:08:59,700  -->  00:09:05,340
And you know use your voice use use pauses make them you know make them anticipate what's going to happen

149

00:09:05,340  -->  00:09:05,820
next.

150

00:09:05,820  -->  00:09:11,790
Same thing here in your Dallasites presentations make it a journey make it like an adventure for your

151

00:09:11,790  -->  00:09:13,800
audience the people that you're presenting to.

152

00:09:14,040  -->  00:09:19,830
So that brings us to the end of what we talked about in the intro in the next tutorial we're going to

153

00:09:19,830  -->  00:09:22,780
talk about why storytelling is important.

154

00:09:22,780  -->  00:09:24,210
There's going to be a fun story as well.

155

00:09:24,300  -->  00:09:25,860
And I look forward to seeing you next time.
