00:00:01.050  -->  00:00:02.880
Hello and welcome back.

2

00:00:02.950  -->  00:00:07.260
Last time is a great and quite long tutorial on the chi squared test.

3

00:00:07.260  -->  00:00:09.180
This time will make it short and sweet.

4

00:00:09.180  -->  00:00:15.000
We only have a few things left to color off and I'll just start off where we finished last time.

5

00:00:15.150  -->  00:00:22.080
So here we had the template that we created or basically the Excel spreadsheet where we ran our chi

6

00:00:22.080  -->  00:00:23.210
squared tests.

7

00:00:23.280  -->  00:00:26.130
By the way you can get the template has promised.

8

00:00:26.170  -->  00:00:30.600
It's in the course materials just like you would download a daughter said you can go and download the

9

00:00:30.600  -->  00:00:37.220
same way you can download this template and use it in case you need it to.

10

00:00:37.260  -->  00:00:41.160
You need to check some things or run a chi square test in the future.

11

00:00:41.160  -->  00:00:45.500
And here we also ran the chi squared test on this Web site.

12

00:00:45.510  -->  00:00:51.990
Over here you can see the link and we were able to confirm that our results are valid so this is just

13

00:00:51.990  -->  00:00:56.200
a quick way of running a square test before having to create everything in Excel.

14

00:00:56.460  -->  00:01:01.900
And what are we going to do now is we going to finish off with the rules of a chi square test.

15

00:01:02.160  -->  00:01:04.120
Let me just find them.

16

00:01:04.140  -->  00:01:06.240
I will bring them up just now.

17

00:01:07.080  -->  00:01:10.540
And there they are.

18

00:01:10.740  -->  00:01:12.470
So the rules of a chi squared test.

19

00:01:12.470  -->  00:01:17.850
These are important things that you need to abide by to make sure your post tests are running correctly

20

00:01:17.850  -->  00:01:24.540
and the results that they're giving you can actually talk about them and use them to back your analysis

21

00:01:24.560  -->  00:01:24.750
.

22

00:01:24.930  -->  00:01:29.510
So using the cast to back reducing and tabbouleh but you need the rules to make sure the consequent

23

00:01:29.550  -->  00:01:30.980
test is working properly.

24

00:01:31.290  -->  00:01:33.710
Number one the probability of independence.

25

00:01:33.720  -->  00:01:36.200
This is what the Cassowary test is about.

26

00:01:36.200  -->  00:01:39.980
This is the essence the quintessence of the squared test.

27

00:01:39.990  -->  00:01:45.810
It basically tells you or helps you understand whether there is some sort of correlation between your

28

00:01:45.810  -->  00:01:49.770
outcome and a certain category or certain variable.

29

00:01:49.890  -->  00:01:56.490
So whether it's gender or it's age whether it's whatever other variable chi squared will by default

30

00:01:56.520  -->  00:02:05.340
assume that there is no relation so the outcome is independent of that variable and then running a squared

31

00:02:05.340  -->  00:02:13.080
test will tell you so if the value is less than 0.05 that means that that's is a incorrect assumption

32

00:02:13.110  -->  00:02:16.190
and that there is actually some sort of correlation.

33

00:02:16.240  -->  00:02:22.500
Number two chi squared test is does not test for the actual relationship between variables it can tell

34

00:02:22.500  -->  00:02:27.660
you if it exists or not but it can tell you what the relationship is so you cannot use the square test

35

00:02:27.660  -->  00:02:38.130
to say that gender has a more significant impact on your outcome than for example in age or for example

36

00:02:38.130  -->  00:02:43.470
the balance on their account or some other animals you can't compare and contrast or compare.

37

00:02:43.470  -->  00:02:46.360
You can only say yes or no that's all that is grotesque and do.

38

00:02:46.590  -->  00:02:52.080
So just make sure that you using the chi square test for the correct purpose.

39

00:02:52.080  -->  00:02:55.380
You cannot use percentages you need absolute values as we discussed.

40

00:02:55.380  -->  00:02:58.290
You have to convert your table into the absolute values.

41

00:02:58.290  -->  00:02:59.970
Make sure you don't put percentages in.

42

00:02:59.970  -->  00:03:05.110
That's a common mistake people make they put in percentages and then they're on the square test.

43

00:03:05.130  -->  00:03:07.800
It'll give you a wrong result.

44

00:03:07.800  -->  00:03:12.990
Categories must be mutually exclusive so you cannot have a category where you can be in one category

45

00:03:13.020  -->  00:03:15.420
and then you can also be maybe in the other category.

46

00:03:15.410  -->  00:03:19.020
They have to be separate like in our example a person either exited or not.

47

00:03:19.020  -->  00:03:20.140
You cannot do both.

48

00:03:20.220  -->  00:03:22.880
So that's a very important assumption of the chi-squared test.

49

00:03:23.210  -->  00:03:26.840
Number five never exclude one of the outcomes doesn't really apply in our case.

50

00:03:26.850  -->  00:03:28.980
But it's good to know about.

51

00:03:29.010  -->  00:03:33.240
Sometimes your data might have several outcomes like we have only two yes or no.

52

00:03:33.240  -->  00:03:35.700
Did the person exit or did the person stay.

53

00:03:35.850  -->  00:03:39.960
But maybe you might have a different data set that might have three or more outcomes.

54

00:03:39.960  -->  00:03:44.820
I'll give you an example let's say you're looking at political preferences of people.

55

00:03:44.820  -->  00:03:53.610
And so your independent also your variables that you're lets you know about the sample are of like gender

56

00:03:53.700  -->  00:03:55.340
age affluence.

57

00:03:55.350  -->  00:03:57.990
How much money they have what car they drive things like that.

58

00:03:58.140  -->  00:04:04.870
And then your outcomes can be Democrats can be Republicans and can also be Greenpeace.

59

00:04:04.890  -->  00:04:07.800
So three different political preferences right.

60

00:04:08.010  -->  00:04:14.010
And even you can be two of them at the same time they're mutually exclusive because you can only vote

61

00:04:14.010  -->  00:04:15.630
for one.

62

00:04:15.690  -->  00:04:18.570
And at the same time there's three of them.

63

00:04:18.570  -->  00:04:24.210
So what this rule is saying is that you cannot if you have three outcomes you should never exclude three

64

00:04:24.210  -->  00:04:27.780
or more outcomes you know exclude one of them so you can just test.

65

00:04:27.870  -->  00:04:31.540
You can't just throw on the chi squared test for Democrat and Republicans.

66

00:04:31.540  -->  00:04:37.080
If the way your sample is constructed that you had all three in there because excluding one of the outcomes

67

00:04:37.380  -->  00:04:40.550
can affect the results of the casket.

68

00:04:40.980  -->  00:04:47.550
Having said that bear in mind that you can exclude categories of one variable like in our example we

69

00:04:47.550  -->  00:04:51.550
had three countries right we had France and Germany and Spain.

70

00:04:51.840  -->  00:04:54.890
And what that means is that we can test the code.

71

00:04:54.990  -->  00:05:01.110
We can run the chi squared test with all three countries and just decide whether a country as a variable

72

00:05:01.500  -->  00:05:05.460
impacts the life whether or not a person leaves.

73

00:05:05.460  -->  00:05:12.390
But what else you can do is you can completely forget about people who are from Germany.

74

00:05:12.390  -->  00:05:12.790
Right.

75

00:05:12.810  -->  00:05:18.390
And you can just say just take them out for a minute from your analysis and just think about people

76

00:05:18.390  -->  00:05:22.550
who are from France and from Spain and you can compare those two against each other so you can run a

77

00:05:22.740  -->  00:05:26.570
quite as just for the two of those countries.

78

00:05:26.660  -->  00:05:28.310
You just gotta understand what the outcome will be.

79

00:05:28.310  -->  00:05:32.940
And in that case the outcome will be whether or not there'll be a significant difference for exiting

80

00:05:32.940  -->  00:05:35.730
the bank depending on whether you're from France or from Spain.

81

00:05:35.730  -->  00:05:41.580
So just those two countries so you can do that you can exclude different categories of a one single

82

00:05:41.580  -->  00:05:47.100
variable and finally rule of six a minimum of five observations in each cell.

83

00:05:47.100  -->  00:05:51.460
So that's an important rule of squared test if you have less than five observations in a cell.

84

00:05:51.480  -->  00:05:52.410
You can't run the test.

85

00:05:52.410  -->  00:05:57.380
You have to look for other tests that might be suitable to your situation.

86

00:05:57.600  -->  00:06:07.590
So we're done with the rules and I'm going to give you a challenge take away that you can work on in

87

00:06:07.590  -->  00:06:09.910
terms of running a chi squared test.

88

00:06:10.230  -->  00:06:14.030
So here is our geography.

89

00:06:14.100  -->  00:06:14.340
Right.

90

00:06:14.340  -->  00:06:16.740
So this is what we just talked about.

91

00:06:16.740  -->  00:06:20.160
It's in percentages so it's converted into absolute values.

92

00:06:20.190  -->  00:06:23.070
There's no geography in absolute values.

93

00:06:23.070  -->  00:06:25.970
And now let's create the observed table.

94

00:06:26.010  -->  00:06:31.920
That's the observed table as you can see now there's three categories on the in in rows.

95

00:06:31.920  -->  00:06:33.390
France Germany and Spain.

96

00:06:33.420  -->  00:06:35.710
And there's still two columns stayed and exited.

97

00:06:36.150  -->  00:06:38.060
And here's our expected table.

98

00:06:38.190  -->  00:06:38.820
Similar right.

99

00:06:38.820  -->  00:06:44.440
So when you're going to be doing this of course you have to calculate the exited properly in this case

100

00:06:44.440  -->  00:06:44.460
.

101

00:06:44.460  -->  00:06:49.380
I use 20 percent but in reality it's a bit different to 20 percent so just use the same approach that

102

00:06:49.380  -->  00:06:53.100
we used previously and that's it.

103

00:06:53.100  -->  00:06:55.430
So all you have to do is run a chi squared test.

104

00:06:55.440  -->  00:06:57.840
I'll give you a few hints here.

105

00:06:57.990  -->  00:07:05.310
First of all if you look back here you kind of see right away that probably it looks like there might

106

00:07:05.310  -->  00:07:07.290
be some sort of correlation.

107

00:07:07.530  -->  00:07:09.090
When you run it for all three jugglery.

108

00:07:09.120  -->  00:07:13.290
So what that Kashgar test will tell is that there probably won't.

109

00:07:13.290  -->  00:07:18.960
It'll probably tell you that there is a dependency between the people exiting and which country they're

110

00:07:18.960  -->  00:07:19.570
from.

111

00:07:19.980  -->  00:07:23.480
And so that's number one.

112

00:07:23.490  -->  00:07:25.830
So you're kind of where you know what the outcome should be.

113

00:07:25.830  -->  00:07:31.620
Hint number two is when you're creating your table you just have to add another row here and just make

114

00:07:31.620  -->  00:07:36.260
sure that your calculations are correct when you're forming your expected table.

115

00:07:36.330  -->  00:07:38.830
Just make them similar to what you see here.

116

00:07:38.850  -->  00:07:41.100
It should be pretty straightforward.

117

00:07:41.460  -->  00:07:48.450
And that way you'll be able to practice creating a cascade test table and then just run the same thing

118

00:07:48.450  -->  00:07:48.720
here.

119

00:07:48.720  -->  00:07:54.780
So for the P-value you have the actuals and your expected table.

120

00:07:55.050  -->  00:07:57.330
And finally here's another hint.

121

00:07:57.330  -->  00:08:00.090
In case you get stuck go to this Web site.

122

00:08:00.270  -->  00:08:07.410
DA s s a r stats dot net slash new h dot HMO.

123

00:08:07.560  -->  00:08:13.410
So what this Web site can do for you is it will allow you to run the cast great test right here so you

124

00:08:13.410  -->  00:08:18.280
just enter the data here and you don't even have to enter the totals so you just take the data as is

125

00:08:18.280  -->  00:08:18.300
.

126

00:08:18.300  -->  00:08:24.030
You just have to take these call in these cells or the cells that we looked at in PowerPoint and you

127

00:08:24.030  -->  00:08:28.740
just put them in here you calculate and I'll give you the p value right away actually give you a lot

128

00:08:28.740  -->  00:08:33.720
more information which you can explore but it will give you the P-value so he can check that P-value

129

00:08:33.750  -->  00:08:39.150
against the one that you created in your Excel template.

130

00:08:39.150  -->  00:08:41.550
And so that sums it up for us for today.

131

00:08:41.550  -->  00:08:47.670
I hope these two tutorials were very insightful into chi squared and that now you're going to be very

132

00:08:47.670  -->  00:08:54.120
confident that what you're doing and Tablo those tests those in very intuitive tests that they are actually

133

00:08:54.120  -->  00:09:01.380
backed by hard statistics and that you will always be able to stand your ground when you're talking

134

00:09:01.710  -->  00:09:05.660
to your manager or chief executive or presenting to an audience.

135

00:09:05.760  -->  00:09:08.700
And I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

136

00:09:08.700  -->  00:09:10.410
Until then happy analyzing
