00:00:01,570  -->  00:00:07,070
In this tutorial I will show you how to install Microsoft business intelligence tools and this course

2

00:00:07,100  -->  00:00:10,620
you'll be using a free package distributed by Microsoft.

3

00:00:10,620  -->  00:00:16,650
Note that if you have Microsoft Visual Studio then skip to the last part of this tutorial and perform

4

00:00:16,650  -->  00:00:21,470
the check to see if your Visual Studio has business intelligence tools integrated.

5

00:00:21,630  -->  00:00:24,060
If so you're all set to go.

6

00:00:24,180  -->  00:00:26,430
All right let's get on with installation.

7

00:00:26,700  -->  00:00:34,770
To start off we will need a browser in Google type in s s d t be-I which stands for a sequel server

8

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:37,800
data tools business intelligence.

9

00:00:37,800  -->  00:00:44,370
You need the Microsoft link here you can see that the latest version of the be-I tools is for Visual

10

00:00:44,370  -->  00:00:46,270
Studio 2013.

11

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:47,850
I recommend going with that.

12

00:00:47,940  -->  00:00:53,880
If you cannot find it and there is a later version available that should also work expand the system

13

00:00:53,880  -->  00:01:00,390
requirements and make sure you have the right operating system and meet the hardware requirements.

14

00:01:00,390  -->  00:01:05,210
Note that this distribution supports both 32 and 64 bit machines.

15

00:01:05,250  -->  00:01:11,540
This will be important for us in an installation step further in this tutorial in the requisites.

16

00:01:11,550  -->  00:01:16,420
You will see that these tools require Microsoft Visual Studio shell to run.

17

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:21,900
If we now expand the additional information section then you will see that this installation packet

18

00:01:21,990  -->  00:01:25,380
actually contains Microsoft Visual Studio shell.

19

00:01:25,380  -->  00:01:30,950
This is great and means that we won't have to install anything else to get the Beatles working.

20

00:01:31,230  -->  00:01:32,560
Download the file.

21

00:01:32,610  -->  00:01:36,580
This is a big file and may take some time to download.

22

00:01:37,410  -->  00:01:41,070
Once the file has been downloaded you need to extract its contents.

23

00:01:41,070  -->  00:01:43,200
This can take up to 10 minutes

24

00:01:46,440  -->  00:01:47,980
after the extraction completes.

25

00:01:48,000  -->  00:01:50,720
You will be presented with the following menu.

26

00:01:50,760  -->  00:01:54,980
You will notice that it looks a lot like Asgill server installation menu.

27

00:01:55,110  -->  00:02:00,250
But don't be worried you're not installing it asking all server all over again.

28

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:04,430
Select the top option newest kill server a standalone installation.

29

00:02:04,800  -->  00:02:12,450
Microsoft will run some checks and finally you'll be presented with the installation type selection

30

00:02:12,450  -->  00:02:13,600
menu.

31

00:02:13,620  -->  00:02:16,000
Now this is the important step.

32

00:02:16,020  -->  00:02:21,380
Logically you would press add features to an existing instance of a SQL Server 2014.

33

00:02:21,660  -->  00:02:28,090
That seems like the right way to go because you have already installed as Ezekiel's Server Express.

34

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:32,520
However if you go down this path you will most likely get an error.

35

00:02:32,520  -->  00:02:39,150
Further down in the installation the reason is that if you have a 64 bit machine then you installed

36

00:02:39,180  -->  00:02:45,780
as he'll server for 64 bit machines whereas as we noted the business intelligence package we are installing

37

00:02:46,110  -->  00:02:48,160
is designed differently.

38

00:02:48,300  -->  00:02:51,970
It works with both 32 and 64 bit machines.

39

00:02:51,990  -->  00:02:56,060
This difference in architecture will prevent you from combining the two.

40

00:02:56,070  -->  00:03:02,430
The correct option here is perform a new installation read through the license agreement and accept

41

00:03:02,460  -->  00:03:04,350
if you agree.

42

00:03:04,610  -->  00:03:09,940
Under feature selection make sure that Asgill server data tools business intelligence and skill.

43

00:03:09,940  -->  00:03:12,950
Client connectivity SDK are selected.

44

00:03:13,050  -->  00:03:17,880
I cannot proceed with this solution because I already have the package on my computer.

45

00:03:17,880  -->  00:03:23,160
We've done the bulk of the work default settings in the remaining steps of find so just click through

46

00:03:23,190  -->  00:03:32,310
and start the installation after the installation has completed go to Start All Programs and find Microsoft

47

00:03:32,390  -->  00:03:34,680
asking all server 20:14.

48

00:03:35,040  -->  00:03:41,590
There you will find a purple icon named Ezekiel server data tools for Visual Studio 2013.

49

00:03:41,760  -->  00:03:45,060
Right click the icon and create a shortcut on your desktop.

50

00:03:45,060  -->  00:03:45,670
Here it is.

51

00:03:45,720  -->  00:03:47,930
You can launch the program.

52

00:03:48,250  -->  00:03:48,750
Great.

53

00:03:48,750  -->  00:03:53,680
The program is launched and now we will test if the be-I tools are installed correctly.

54

00:03:53,730  -->  00:04:01,440
Go to file new project and under business intelligence find integration services.

55

00:04:01,440  -->  00:04:03,490
Notice the description on the right.

56

00:04:03,570  -->  00:04:09,870
It says this project may be used for building high performance door integration and workforce solutions

57

00:04:10,170  -->  00:04:16,260
including extraction transformation loading ITIL operations for data warehousing.

58

00:04:16,260  -->  00:04:18,420
This is exactly what we need.

59

00:04:18,420  -->  00:04:23,790
The tool is ready to go and we will learn how to use Sosias in one of the next sections in this course

60

00:04:23,810  -->  00:04:24,210
.
