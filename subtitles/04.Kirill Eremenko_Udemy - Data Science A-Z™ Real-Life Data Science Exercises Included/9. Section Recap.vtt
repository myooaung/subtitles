00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:03.680
Section recap another section behind your belt.

2

00:00:03.690  -->  00:00:04.790
Congratulations.

3

00:00:04.830  -->  00:00:10.820
Let's see what we learned in this one and this section we learned number one how to connect tablet to

4

00:00:10.820  -->  00:00:11.910
an Excel file.

5

00:00:11.910  -->  00:00:17.040
Not that much different to CSV file the only probably difference that you would want to point out is

6

00:00:17.040  -->  00:00:23.820
that you if you have many tabs in your Excel file then you will see all the tabs in you in Tablo and

7

00:00:23.820  -->  00:00:26.680
you have select the correct tab that you want to be working with.

8

00:00:26.700  -->  00:00:30.420
And so if you want to get to multiple tabs then you have to create a connection a new connection every

9

00:00:30.420  -->  00:00:31.920
time.

10

00:00:31.920  -->  00:00:35.280
Number two how to visualize add hold AB tests.

11

00:00:35.310  -->  00:00:43.830
So I showed you my personal invention I'd call it a kind of framework that I use for a running ad hoc

12

00:00:43.860  -->  00:00:48.220
A B tests a very quick way to run your AB tests.

13

00:00:48.240  -->  00:00:56.820
It's not a proper full fledged statistical way of running a B tests so we don't check for significance

14

00:00:56.820  -->  00:00:58.170
and so on.

15

00:00:58.200  -->  00:01:00.040
However there's two points.

16

00:01:00.060  -->  00:01:08.670
First of all in the next section we will change all of that and you will see that it is very easy to

17

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:14.630
get that statistical backing behind your findings and I'll show you exactly how to do that.

18

00:01:14.640  -->  00:01:19.440
We'll be talking about something called a chi square test which might sound scary but it's actually

19

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:20.870
very very simple.

20

00:01:21.030  -->  00:01:28.320
And that will give our visual AB tests that we've been learning in this section full power full statistical

21

00:01:28.320  -->  00:01:30.830
power and full statistical weight.

22

00:01:30.900  -->  00:01:36.780
And the second point is that these visual visually B tests are so simple you don't have to waste your

23

00:01:36.780  -->  00:01:42.150
time running all the stats or crunching all the numbers just to find out that there's no significant

24

00:01:42.150  -->  00:01:46.950
difference or something that does and doesn't matter to you like this and tabel you just throw in your

25

00:01:46.950  -->  00:01:53.460
variables and within a couple of minutes you've run maybe five Statistical to five visual AB tests and

26

00:01:53.460  -->  00:01:55.260
you know where to keep looking.

27

00:01:55.260  -->  00:01:57.470
So this is what Data mining is about.

28

00:01:57.480  -->  00:01:58.980
It's not about stats.

29

00:01:58.980  -->  00:02:02.070
We're not statisticians we're data scientists.

30

00:02:02.070  -->  00:02:08.490
We're mining the data we're getting insights passed and we get what we want and as quickly as possible

31

00:02:08.490  -->  00:02:10.180
and then we take it from there.

32

00:02:10.200  -->  00:02:16.260
Number three how do you create Aliase is a very powerful technique in Tablo which makes your work easier

33

00:02:16.260  -->  00:02:20.730
because you know which variables you're dealing with you don't have to deal if numbers were not computers

34

00:02:20.730  -->  00:02:21.530
after all.

35

00:02:21.660  -->  00:02:27.930
And you can convert a one in 2 years 0 to know where you can rename basically values inside your columns

36

00:02:27.970  -->  00:02:28.640
.

37

00:02:28.650  -->  00:02:33.510
Very powerful technique to have not just for working with Salol but also for visualization and a helps

38

00:02:33.510  -->  00:02:37.900
your audience understand better when in your college and for instance you don't have ones and zeros

39

00:02:37.920  -->  00:02:42.650
you have yesses a nose or exited and stayed with the bank and things like that.

40

00:02:42.990  -->  00:02:45.290
How to add a reference line to your chart.

41

00:02:45.450  -->  00:02:46.710
Also good technique.

42

00:02:46.740  -->  00:02:55.200
So we added a fixed reference line because we already knew what our average rate of leaving the bank

43

00:02:55.200  -->  00:02:56.610
was which was 20 percent.

44

00:02:56.640  -->  00:03:03.180
So having that visually present allowed us to analyze quickly understand what is below average what

45

00:03:03.180  -->  00:03:04.180
is above average.

46

00:03:04.240  -->  00:03:10.250
So adds value to your analysis and helps you analyze faster.

47

00:03:10.350  -->  00:03:13.740
We also learn how to use ad hoc AB tests to find anomalies.

48

00:03:13.740  -->  00:03:16.860
So probably two things I wanted to mention here.

49

00:03:16.950  -->  00:03:22.490
You saw that by running these AB tests we were able to quickly find variables that matter to us variables

50

00:03:22.490  -->  00:03:25.080
that don't matter to us find any anomalies.

51

00:03:25.080  -->  00:03:31.020
Anomalies are more like things that we don't expect to happen but they do happen like the situation

52

00:03:31.020  -->  00:03:37.470
that we saw with a number of products like that was kind of an anomaly and that was definitely something

53

00:03:37.470  -->  00:03:43.800
we would take forward and investigate further what's going on there and that is definitely not normal

54

00:03:43.800  -->  00:03:50.880
to see that with the rise of number of products the churn rate also increases after some stage and you'll

55

00:03:50.880  -->  00:03:57.900
be surprised at how many weird things you'll be able to uncover in the data through these kind of tests

56

00:03:58.350  -->  00:04:03.810
and it is by looking into those insights that you are able to not only fulfill the requirements of your

57

00:04:03.810  -->  00:04:11.430
project but actually go above and beyond and add immense value to your business sometimes much greater

58

00:04:11.430  -->  00:04:14.850
than what you're going to add through your project itself.

59

00:04:14.940  -->  00:04:20.940
And so also the second point on Number 5 is that you saw how easy it was once you set up your template

60

00:04:20.940  -->  00:04:26.500
you've set up the formatting you put the reference line in you you just have you just have to duplicate

61

00:04:26.500  -->  00:04:30.020
it replicated and change the name of your code that will replace the code.

62

00:04:30.030  -->  00:04:33.800
It's very easy to run these ad hoc tests once you set up the first one.

63

00:04:33.810  -->  00:04:37.840
They're easy to replicate and the mistakes how to validate your daughter approach.

64

00:04:37.950  -->  00:04:39.490
A very handy trick there.

65

00:04:39.510  -->  00:04:44.220
Use a call them or a verbal you know has no influence on the result.

66

00:04:44.250  -->  00:04:50.880
For example the last digit of their mobile number or their client account number and check that there

67

00:04:50.880  -->  00:04:57.420
is a uniform distribution that will help you avoid any errors you might have in your approach or check

68

00:04:57.420  -->  00:04:59.320
any errors for any errors in the data.

69

00:04:59.640  -->  00:05:02.460
And that's the end of the section I'll look for you next time.

70

00:05:02.490  -->  00:05:04.050
Until then happy analyzing
