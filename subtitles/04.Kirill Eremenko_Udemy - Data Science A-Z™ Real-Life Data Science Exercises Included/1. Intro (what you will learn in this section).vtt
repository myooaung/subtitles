Welcome to part two of the presentation and communication techniques.

2

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:09.650
So in the previous section we talked about communication.

3

00:00:09.750  -->  00:00:12.990
And it was more focused on getting information out of people.

4

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:18.080
Right so like preparing for a project and setting expectations and so on.

5

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:20.970
So I hope you noticed that.

6

00:00:20.980  -->  00:00:26.310
And in this section we'll be doing opposite we'll be putting knowledge into people's heads and we will

7

00:00:26.310  -->  00:00:27.870
see what are the best techniques.

8

00:00:27.960  -->  00:00:30.570
And so in this section we'll talk about all things.

9

00:00:30.780  -->  00:00:33.200

11

00:00:39.340  -->  00:00:39.360

13

00:00:43.200  -->  00:00:51.360
And so we'll talk about that and then I'll just do some tips and tricks that I use on presenting and

14

00:00:51.450  -->  00:00:55.780
bear in mind that they work for all sides already all size audience.

15

00:00:55.800  -->  00:01:01.710
I use them for size audiences whether it's 250 people whether it's 25 people five people one person

16

00:01:02.660  -->  00:01:09.600
