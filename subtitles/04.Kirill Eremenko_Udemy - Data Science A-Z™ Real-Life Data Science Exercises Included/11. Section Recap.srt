00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:05,610
All right so today we're going to recap on the multiple linear regression modeling section of the course

2

00:00:05,610  -->  00:00:05,880
.

3

00:00:05,960  -->  00:00:07,130
It is a fun section.

4

00:00:07,140  -->  00:00:13,170
We learned a lot actually built a robust model and I really hope you enjoyed the terminals in the section

5

00:00:13,180  -->  00:00:13,340
.

6

00:00:13,560  -->  00:00:18,300
And before we do a recap and continue I wanted to ask you for a quick favor if you enjoyed the course

7

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:24,120
so far if you like what you're seeing and if you're having fun and you're learning a lot then I hope

8

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:26,330
you don't mind leaving a review for this course.

9

00:00:26,340  -->  00:00:31,470
It's very easy to do you just go to the course you have to go to the course on a computer I don't think

10

00:00:31,470  -->  00:00:36,450
you can do this on mobile in the top right corner there's a button here writer view might be called

11

00:00:36,450  -->  00:00:38,400
liberating and might be highlight in white.

12

00:00:38,400  -->  00:00:42,810
So all you have to do is click that button and then a window will pop up where you can select the number

13

00:00:42,810  -->  00:00:44,700
of stars you think the score deserves.

14

00:00:44,700  -->  00:00:50,130
And that's that's totally enough for me but if you want to write a small note then please feel free

15

00:00:50,130  -->  00:00:52,890
to do so to let me know how it went with the scores.

16

00:00:52,890  -->  00:00:56,630
And you know if your expectations were met and if you had fun or not.

17

00:00:57,060  -->  00:00:58,540
And I really hope you can do that.

18

00:00:58,540  -->  00:01:00,670
It would mean a lot for me.

19

00:01:00,720  -->  00:01:03,640
And now let's continue on with the course.

20

00:01:03,660  -->  00:01:09,450
All right section recap in this section we learned number one how to create dummies for categorical

21

00:01:09,480  -->  00:01:11,220
independent variables.

22

00:01:11,220  -->  00:01:16,710
We went through the whole process of how you look at the categories you create new columns you've populate

23

00:01:16,710  -->  00:01:23,970
them of ones and zeros and then you use the categories instead of the actual categorical variable in

24

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:24,620
your modeling.

25

00:01:24,810  -->  00:01:27,720
Number two was how to avoid the dummy verbal trap.

26

00:01:27,810  -->  00:01:35,010
Remember that you can for any set of dummy variables for one aspecific for one given categorical variable

27

00:01:35,010  -->  00:01:35,290
.

28

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:39,920
You can't use all of these dummy variables you have to always omit one.

29

00:01:39,990  -->  00:01:43,670
Otherwise your model won't work and you'll fall into the dummy variable trap.

30

00:01:43,680  -->  00:01:44,660
We don't want that to happen.

31

00:01:44,670  -->  00:01:51,980
So just remember that always use and minus one dummy variables for any given set of variables.

32

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:59,160
Number three we learned the backward forward the bi directional and the all possible methods of creating

33

00:01:59,310  -->  00:01:59,870
models.

34

00:01:59,910  -->  00:02:04,710
The all possible method here is the one where you create all the models and then just compare them and

35

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:06,660
find the best one.

36

00:02:06,660  -->  00:02:13,650
So we actually went through step by step blueprints for every single one of these methods and hopefully

37

00:02:13,680  -->  00:02:14,440
can take them away.

38

00:02:14,450  -->  00:02:19,350
And whenever you need to reference them you will know exactly where to find them or you will already

39

00:02:19,350  -->  00:02:21,680
know how to perform these methods.

40

00:02:21,690  -->  00:02:27,040
Now before we actually build a model step by step and you can see that I'm very proud of that.

41

00:02:27,060  -->  00:02:28,620
I put two exclamation marks.

42

00:02:28,680  -->  00:02:35,400
Step by step we actually manually built a model using the backward elimination method and we learned

43

00:02:35,460  -->  00:02:42,270
a lot along the way we had variables that dropdown variables that changed their significance variables

44

00:02:42,520  -->  00:02:45,750
that you know we didn't want to drop or we looked charts.

45

00:02:46,050  -->  00:02:51,960
Personally I really enjoyed it and I enjoyed explaining it to you I hope you learned a lot from that

46

00:02:51,960  -->  00:02:53,730
part of the course.

47

00:02:53,730  -->  00:02:59,970
Next we learned how to use the adjusted R-squared in modeling so we actually learned how to not only

48

00:03:00,300  -->  00:03:08,960
bluntly follow our significant level threshold but also apply a criteria in this case to our squared

49

00:03:09,690  -->  00:03:15,000
metric to understand if we're on the right track through our modeling and that helps create more robust

50

00:03:15,000  -->  00:03:20,870
models and not just blindly exclude or include variables just because the rules say so.

51

00:03:21,240  -->  00:03:27,480
And finally point number six we learned how to interpret coefficients of a multiple linear regression

52

00:03:27,870  -->  00:03:28,760
model.

53

00:03:28,770  -->  00:03:36,150
Once again there was a tip there that use per units of variable per unit of independent variable poignance

54

00:03:36,150  -->  00:03:37,070
of dependent variable.

55

00:03:37,070  -->  00:03:44,130
And that will keep you out of trouble because you that way you don't have to make sure that the variables

56

00:03:44,160  -->  00:03:45,440
are on the same scale.

57

00:03:45,570  -->  00:03:51,450
If you start talking about dollars telomerase or actual absolute values then you have to make sure that

58

00:03:51,450  -->  00:03:52,610
you're in some sense count.

59

00:03:52,740  -->  00:03:57,780
And one last point there is that this interpretation method works for multiple regression later on the

60

00:03:57,780  -->  00:04:02,510
course will be talking about logistic regression interpretation there is different.

61

00:04:02,520  -->  00:04:06,060
So just keep that in mind Pope enjoyed the section.

62

00:04:06,060  -->  00:04:09,110
Don't forget to rate the course if you haven't done so yet.

63

00:04:09,240  -->  00:04:13,020
And I really look forward to seeing you in the next section of the Course.

64

00:04:13,020  -->  00:04:14,550
Until then happy analyzing
