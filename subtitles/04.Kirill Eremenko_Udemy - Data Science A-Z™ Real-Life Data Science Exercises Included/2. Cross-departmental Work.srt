1

00:00:01,290  -->  00:00:02,750
Cross departmental work.

2

00:00:02,910  -->  00:00:06,960
Now if you're really working as a data scientists you will totally know what I'm talking about.

3

00:00:06,990  -->  00:00:13,200
If you're not yet then prepare yourself for what's going to happen once you start as a data scientist

4

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:13,240
.

5

00:00:13,260  -->  00:00:19,530
You will find that you're working not in one division not into working across three four or five divisions

6

00:00:19,530  -->  00:00:26,510
at times and you working with everybody because data scientists are a very unique type of role.

7

00:00:26,520  -->  00:00:33,510
You need to have access to all levels of the organization levels up and down and sideways so hierarchical

8

00:00:33,510  -->  00:00:35,140
levels and we'll talk about that more.

9

00:00:35,310  -->  00:00:43,230
And also like different departments I'll give you my example so in my previous role I was in the marketing

10

00:00:43,230  -->  00:00:47,250
department but half the time I was working with I.T. department.

11

00:00:47,250  -->  00:00:52,650
And the funny part was they were actually located in two separate buildings across the road.

12

00:00:52,650  -->  00:00:58,750
So I was sitting in one department and the I.T. people were sitting in the opposite on opposite sides

13

00:00:58,750  -->  00:00:59,440
of the road.

14

00:00:59,580  -->  00:01:01,400
And I had to work very closely with him.

15

00:01:01,560  -->  00:01:02,550
And how did that come to be.

16

00:01:02,550  -->  00:01:07,650
Well the I was in a team called Casler experience and insight.

17

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:14,910
So I was doing data science which was related to the experience that some members of this organization

18

00:01:14,910  -->  00:01:18,560
or customers of this organization goes through on a daily basis.

19

00:01:18,840  -->  00:01:24,850
But at the same time I need access to databases any skill server I needed reporting services I needed

20

00:01:24,860  -->  00:01:30,670
to extract I needed all these all sorts of things I need new tools and software.

21

00:01:30,800  -->  00:01:33,370
And so I had to over fighting the department a lot.

22

00:01:33,570  -->  00:01:39,390
And before this happened because I was first out of scientists at this organization the two departments

23

00:01:39,390  -->  00:01:41,530
actually didn't talk much to each other.

24

00:01:41,650  -->  00:01:45,400
Yes they did throw around some data once in a while but they didn't have this connection.

25

00:01:45,510  -->  00:01:51,270
And that is what you will find when you come in you will become this bridge between departments.

26

00:01:51,270  -->  00:01:57,270
Sometimes when the connection isn't there but she needed you will become that hub where light which

27

00:01:57,270  -->  00:02:04,850
connects all sorts of different departments can be marketing I.T. operations finance whatever.

28

00:02:04,860  -->  00:02:09,930
All of these departments that you are connecting in your work they'll be going through you.

29

00:02:10,020  -->  00:02:15,560
And from my experience and this is the feedback I got from the organization I brought these departments

30

00:02:15,560  -->  00:02:16,900
across here like it.

31

00:02:17,180  -->  00:02:21,590
It didn't even feel like there was a brawl between us anymore it felt like we were working close so

32

00:02:21,590  -->  00:02:29,270
we had by the end of my side that we started having every Monday we would have a catch up where there

33

00:02:29,280  -->  00:02:33,360
was the I.T. Department and the marketing department sitting together for an hour talking about you

34

00:02:33,360  -->  00:02:34,750
know what one of the plans for the week.

35

00:02:34,750  -->  00:02:40,920
Like that's unheard of in that industry in which I was working and we prepared for that.

36

00:02:40,950  -->  00:02:43,830
So you will need to work across departments.

37

00:02:43,860  -->  00:02:45,060
That's a that's one example.

38

00:02:45,060  -->  00:02:46,230
Marketing and I.T..

39

00:02:46,320  -->  00:02:48,210
I also worked in operations a lot.

40

00:02:48,210  -->  00:02:55,470
Because you know optimizing existing business processes or resolving backlogs increasing efficiencies

41

00:02:55,470  -->  00:02:58,000
and so on so you will be working for operations.

42

00:02:58,230  -->  00:03:03,990
And so every time you work with a new department make sure to establish the connections there so that

43

00:03:04,980  -->  00:03:12,060
you like know the managers there or executives there and like they know the work you're doing so you

44

00:03:12,060  -->  00:03:17,280
can always come back there and you know get inside if you need their help with something and they need

45

00:03:17,280  -->  00:03:19,740
your help with something you're going to be a people person generally.

46

00:03:19,830  -->  00:03:24,150
And don't be afraid to work walk around the organization Don't be afraid.

47

00:03:24,150  -->  00:03:30,720
Don't always just sit at your desk and do the work that I would normally easily just grab my stuff and

48

00:03:30,720  -->  00:03:36,180
spend two or three days with I.T. guys just sitting there working on a spare computer there or you know

49

00:03:36,180  -->  00:03:42,630
go and sit with Operation guys for for a day like you would be really hard to find me at my desk because

50

00:03:42,900  -->  00:03:45,870
I'm always getting these insights you go to.

51

00:03:45,870  -->  00:03:52,910
You got to know not just the dot but you also going to know the intrinsic details of your organization

52

00:03:52,920  -->  00:03:58,080
how it works is like it's like a living organism you've got to understand exactly you know how pulsates

53

00:03:58,080  -->  00:04:04,170
and what is cool what are the cause and effects that that lead to certain phenomenons that you're observing

54

00:04:04,170  -->  00:04:09,630
and things like that so the more you get out there the better the data scientist is a person that works

55

00:04:09,690  -->  00:04:11,880
across a lot of different departments
