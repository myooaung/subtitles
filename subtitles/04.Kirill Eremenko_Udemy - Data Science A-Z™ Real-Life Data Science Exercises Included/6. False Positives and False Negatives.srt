1

00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:03,890
This material we will be talking about false positives and false negatives.

2

00:00:04,140  -->  00:00:09,760
As you remember at the end of the previous presentation we left off over here where we were using the

3

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:19,380
logistic regression function to observe where four random values of the independent variable will end

4

00:00:19,470  -->  00:00:26,550
up in terms of y had so in terms of the predicted value for the dependent variable and we agreed that

5

00:00:26,820  -->  00:00:36,300
anything below the 50 percent line will be projected downwards onto the zero horizontal line and anything

6

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:43,920
above the 50 percent line will be projected upwards onto the 100 percent horizontal line and that allowed

7

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:48,310
us to turn probabilities into actual predictions.

8

00:00:48,330  -->  00:00:51,900
So either yes or no.

9

00:00:52,010  -->  00:00:56,780
Now let's take a step back where did we get these four values from.

10

00:00:56,940  -->  00:01:03,720
So we took four random values of the independent variable and we just had a look at what would happen

11

00:01:03,720  -->  00:01:11,040
to them how we can use how we would use the logistic regression function to ascertain what probability

12

00:01:11,040  -->  00:01:14,760
they have and what y had values they have.

13

00:01:14,880  -->  00:01:20,940
So Halba we take another step back and we forget about these four random values and instead of taking

14

00:01:20,940  -->  00:01:26,170
four random values of the independent variable How about we take for unknown values.

15

00:01:26,190  -->  00:01:30,000
In fact let's take four values for the independent variable.

16

00:01:30,000  -->  00:01:31,240
From our dataset.

17

00:01:31,290  -->  00:01:37,230
So let's just pick out for values that we really know they exist in our data set and we use them to

18

00:01:37,230  -->  00:01:41,130
create this logistic regression.

19

00:01:41,670  -->  00:01:45,550
And let's do the same thing with them let's see where they will end up.

20

00:01:45,750  -->  00:01:51,290
If we apply the model to them and as you can see here the label of the vertical axis changed to.

21

00:01:51,300  -->  00:01:51,890
Why.

22

00:01:51,900  -->  00:01:58,290
Because this is the we already know that in red is the actual value of the dependent variable because

23

00:01:58,290  -->  00:01:59,460
we know the result.

24

00:01:59,460  -->  00:02:04,560
Those are the people on the bottom so observations number one and number three they didn't take up the

25

00:02:04,560  -->  00:02:10,920
offer the email offer and the observations on the top people number two and four.

26

00:02:10,920  -->  00:02:13,330
They did take up the email offer.

27

00:02:13,350  -->  00:02:19,890
So let's see what happens to them if we apply our logistic regression model.

28

00:02:19,920  -->  00:02:26,970
So step number one would be to project these values onto the curve makes sense right.

29

00:02:26,970  -->  00:02:33,690
So we just want to see where they all end up on the curve that's all blue dots over there that's where

30

00:02:33,690  -->  00:02:36,390
they have been modeled by the curve.

31

00:02:36,390  -->  00:02:41,190
Now we can from here we can say what the probabilities are you just have to project to the left and

32

00:02:41,430  -->  00:02:45,050
you can see approximately that for a version number one.

33

00:02:45,120  -->  00:02:51,530
It's about maybe 20 percent 10 15 percent let's say 15 percent observation of battue.

34

00:02:51,680  -->  00:02:56,850
It's about 40 percent absorption and with three I would say about 70 percent observation and before

35

00:02:57,120  -->  00:02:58,570
about 85 percent.

36

00:02:59,040  -->  00:03:06,420
But we're not interested in probabilities per se right now what we want to get to is the actual y hat

37

00:03:06,480  -->  00:03:11,310
we want to see what the predicted value will be so we want to say we want to see if the model will tell

38

00:03:11,310  -->  00:03:11,770
us.

39

00:03:11,940  -->  00:03:15,220
Are these people going to take off or not.

40

00:03:15,270  -->  00:03:19,080
And why would we want to do this is because we already know the result right.

41

00:03:19,080  -->  00:03:25,950
We already know what the result will be or was and we just want to see we want to kind of assess the

42

00:03:25,950  -->  00:03:30,800
model we want to see how well it's working and if it's going to make any mistakes.

43

00:03:31,350  -->  00:03:37,150
So let's go ahead and proceed with our logic for getting the y hat and what was all logic there.

44

00:03:37,230  -->  00:03:42,480
Well the same thing that we discussed just a few minutes ago at the start of this tutorial you anything

45

00:03:42,510  -->  00:03:45,750
we're using this arbitrary horizontal line 50 percent.

46

00:03:45,840  -->  00:03:52,770
So anything below this line is going to be projected onto the horizontal line which is zero.

47

00:03:52,770  -->  00:03:59,550
So where we're saying that the offer is not going to be taken up and anything above the 50 percent line

48

00:03:59,610  -->  00:04:04,100
will be projected onto the horizontal line which is one or 100 percent.

49

00:04:04,440  -->  00:04:10,330
Where is saying that those people that end up on that line are going to take up the offer.

50

00:04:10,680  -->  00:04:13,740
So let's go ahead and do that.

51

00:04:13,740  -->  00:04:20,590
There we go in gray We have our projections or our predicted values so why that isn't great.

52

00:04:20,700  -->  00:04:24,620
And it's very interesting to see both why and why I had on one chart.

53

00:04:24,630  -->  00:04:29,630
So that means what actually happened is in red and what we predicted was going to happen isn't great

54

00:04:29,650  -->  00:04:30,190
.

55

00:04:30,360  -->  00:04:33,990
And right away you can see that for absorptions number one and number four.

56

00:04:33,990  -->  00:04:43,060
So for those people in observation the them before they were predicted correctly so we said for the

57

00:04:43,170  -->  00:04:49,590
person number one we predicted that he won't take up the offer and he actually did not take up the offer

58

00:04:49,590  -->  00:04:54,460
because the red mark is also on the same horizontal line.

59

00:04:54,570  -->  00:04:56,460
Now for observation and before.

60

00:04:56,460  -->  00:05:00,110
Same thing we predicted that that person will will take up the offer.

61

00:05:00,210  -->  00:05:02,310
And they did take up the offer.

62

00:05:02,310  -->  00:05:02,960
That's good.

63

00:05:03,150  -->  00:05:04,510
But now let's have a look at.

64

00:05:04,510  -->  00:05:05,390
Observation number two.

65

00:05:05,410  -->  00:05:11,400
Number three you can see that for observation Number two the gray lines at the bottom.

66

00:05:11,400  -->  00:05:17,880
The green marks at the bottom meaning that the model is predicting for this person based on their gender

67

00:05:17,880  -->  00:05:18,910
based on their age.

68

00:05:18,930  -->  00:05:25,080
Well in this case just age because we're doing a single variable logistic regression.

69

00:05:25,080  -->  00:05:32,220
So based on their age this model is saying that this person is not going to take up the offer because

70

00:05:32,220  -->  00:05:33,660
the gray market is at the bottom.

71

00:05:33,660  -->  00:05:39,630
However we can see that the red mark is at the top meaning that this person did take up the offer and

72

00:05:39,720  -->  00:05:43,510
that means that the logistic regression made an error here.

73

00:05:43,740  -->  00:05:46,710
And same thing for person number three.

74

00:05:47,370  -->  00:05:53,220
The gray markers at the top and that means that the models are predicting that the person will will

75

00:05:53,220  -->  00:05:57,570
take up the offer but the red marks at the bottom meaning that the person didn't actually take up the

76

00:05:57,570  -->  00:06:05,100
offer and therefore the logistic regression made a mistake once again and these mistakes they actually

77

00:06:05,100  -->  00:06:06,200
have specific names.

78

00:06:06,210  -->  00:06:12,360
So the top mistake over there is a false positive or a type 1 error.

79

00:06:12,480  -->  00:06:14,120
What does post false positive mean.

80

00:06:14,190  -->  00:06:19,560
Well it means that we said we predicted a positive outcome but it was false.

81

00:06:19,590  -->  00:06:21,060
So we were.

82

00:06:21,210  -->  00:06:24,140
We predicted an effect that did not occur.

83

00:06:24,630  -->  00:06:29,940
And the other mistake you see here has a different name it's called a false negative.

84

00:06:29,940  -->  00:06:33,410
So we predicted that there won't be an effect.

85

00:06:33,690  -->  00:06:35,450
But the effect actually did occur.

86

00:06:35,550  -->  00:06:37,620
So our prediction was negative.

87

00:06:37,650  -->  00:06:42,750
Meaning there won't be an effect but it was a false negative and it's called a type 2 type of error

88

00:06:42,750  -->  00:06:43,180
.

89

00:06:43,320  -->  00:06:48,890
And the way I personally remember them it's important also to distinguish between the two.

90

00:06:48,900  -->  00:06:59,280
The way I personally remember them is I think of type 1 as less dangerous than type 2 so type type 1

91

00:06:59,280  -->  00:07:05,520
is less for me in my in my mind although it's not necessarily the case but the way that's the way I

92

00:07:05,520  -->  00:07:08,480
remember them that type one is kind of like a warning.

93

00:07:08,520  -->  00:07:12,930
So that's why there's an ordered orange explanation mark and it's it's a false positive.

94

00:07:12,930  -->  00:07:15,900
So basically you said something is going to happen but it didn't happen.

95

00:07:15,900  -->  00:07:20,070
So you said maybe there'll be an earthquake but there wasn't an earthquake so you know that's not the

96

00:07:20,070  -->  00:07:26,870
end of the world but false negative is a bit worse in my view once again understanding because once

97

00:07:27,030  -->  00:07:30,750
you say something's not going to happen but it actually does happen then you can't even be prepared

98

00:07:30,750  -->  00:07:32,140
for it.

99

00:07:32,340  -->  00:07:37,730
And that's why Type 2 is false negative and that's how I remember them personally.

100

00:07:37,920  -->  00:07:39,510
But once again it could be.

101

00:07:39,540  -->  00:07:40,770
Absolutely.

102

00:07:40,800  -->  00:07:46,260
They can both be pretty serious errors especially when you are dealing with like medical conclusions

103

00:07:46,260  -->  00:07:47,390
and stuff like that.

104

00:07:47,820  -->  00:07:51,790
So those are false positives and false negatives.

105

00:07:52,200  -->  00:07:58,150
We will be using them more when we talk about the confusion matra matrix in the next tutorial and I'll

106

00:07:58,150  -->  00:07:59,190
look for you next time.

107

00:07:59,190  -->  00:08:00,460
Until then happy analyzing
