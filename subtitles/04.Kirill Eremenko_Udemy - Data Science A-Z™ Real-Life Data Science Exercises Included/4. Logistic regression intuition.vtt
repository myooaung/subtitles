00:00:00.750  -->  00:00:06.300
All right let's do this logistic regression intuition and you could probably tell by my voice that I'm

2

00:00:06.300  -->  00:00:07.420
pretty excited.

3

00:00:07.440  -->  00:00:12.390
There's some very interesting slides coming up and this is quite an important topic but at the same

4

00:00:12.390  -->  00:00:19.020
time it is quite challenging so a quick heads up there will be some math and I've done a few run through

5

00:00:19.130  -->  00:00:21.040
of this presentation already.

6

00:00:21.240  -->  00:00:26.660
And I really I will try my best to convey everything in the simplest way possible.

7

00:00:26.730  -->  00:00:28.670
So let's get into it.

8

00:00:28.830  -->  00:00:30.840
We already know about the linear regression.

9

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:35.730
We know that there is a simple linear regression and it has this very short formula with one independent

10

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:36.540
variable.

11

00:00:36.540  -->  00:00:42.510
And we also have looked into the multiple linear regression which has many independent variables.

12

00:00:42.630  -->  00:00:50.550
So we already know how to deal with this type of challenge so when we have a scalpel like that where

13

00:00:50.810  -->  00:00:54.500
on the horizontal axis we've got the independent variable on the vertical axis.

14

00:00:54.510  -->  00:01:00.790
We've got the dependent variable and it's an example we looked at salary versus experience.

15

00:01:01.200  -->  00:01:03.360
How do we create a model here.

16

00:01:03.360  -->  00:01:06.160
So we use a simple linear regression.

17

00:01:06.210  -->  00:01:11.920
It puts a line through our data and that line is modeling our observations.

18

00:01:11.940  -->  00:01:18.680
So we can basically forecast things and compare our actual preservations to our model and so on.

19

00:01:18.900  -->  00:01:23.390
But so we know how to deal with challenges like that or a problem like that.

20

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:26.550
But what we saw in the tutorial was a bit different.

21

00:01:26.550  -->  00:01:27.770
Well actually was very different.

22

00:01:27.770  -->  00:01:29.460
It was completely new.

23

00:01:29.520  -->  00:01:30.370
We solved this.

24

00:01:30.420  -->  00:01:34.940
So we saw age on the horizontal axis so an independent variable as we expect.

25

00:01:35.070  -->  00:01:41.940
But on the vertical axis we saw a categorical variable which only had two values either zero meaning

26

00:01:41.940  -->  00:01:45.010
no or 1 meaning yes.

27

00:01:45.050  -->  00:01:49.590
So did the person take up an action to perform an action did they take up an offer.

28

00:01:49.590  -->  00:01:50.640
Did the by product.

29

00:01:50.640  -->  00:01:53.550
Did they open up an email respond to our email and so on.

30

00:01:53.550  -->  00:01:54.930
So was the action taken or not.

31

00:01:54.960  -->  00:01:56.860
And the very black and white.

32

00:01:57.030  -->  00:01:58.180
Very different.

33

00:01:58.380  -->  00:02:03.060
But at the same time even though we don't know what to do We don't know what is going on here it's not

34

00:02:03.060  -->  00:02:08.580
what we're expecting but at the same time in today we can see that there is some sort of correlation

35

00:02:08.790  -->  00:02:14.520
we can see that the observations on the bottom they're a bit more to the left observations on the top

36

00:02:14.520  -->  00:02:21.570
or a bit more to the right implying kind of that's probably older people are more likely to take action

37

00:02:22.440  -->  00:02:23.690
based on this offer.

38

00:02:23.820  -->  00:02:26.490
And younger people are more likely to ignore it.

39

00:02:26.910  -->  00:02:29.580
So can we somehow model this.

40

00:02:29.580  -->  00:02:36.100
How about we try our existing method in our toolkit which is the linear regression.

41

00:02:36.300  -->  00:02:38.700
Let's run a aggression and that's what it looks like.

42

00:02:38.700  -->  00:02:42.350
And this is exactly what Grettel did for us in the Prue's tutorial.

43

00:02:42.600  -->  00:02:50.280
As you can tell it doesn't look like the best approach doesn't look like the best method to solve this

44

00:02:50.400  -->  00:02:51.110
problem.

45

00:02:51.300  -->  00:02:57.050
So let's look into this in a bit more detail.

46

00:02:57.120  -->  00:03:05.070
We're going to draw the other horizontal line order here instead of trying to predict exactly what's

47

00:03:05.070  -->  00:03:10.860
going to happen for any given person let's imagine a person and let's say we want to predict for that

48

00:03:10.860  -->  00:03:16.160
person knowing their age we want to predict whether they will take up the offer or not.

49

00:03:16.350  -->  00:03:20.160
But instead of predicting exactly whether they're going to take it up or not.

50

00:03:20.290  -->  00:03:29.190
How But instead we will predict the probability will we will state a probability or a likelihood of

51

00:03:29.190  -->  00:03:30.990
that person taking up that offer.

52

00:03:31.230  -->  00:03:36.540
And if you think of it in that way right away things started becoming clearer right away you can see

53

00:03:36.540  -->  00:03:36.820
that.

54

00:03:36.850  -->  00:03:40.590
OK so this chart is actually from 0 to 1.

55

00:03:40.800  -->  00:03:43.830
And I also know that probabilities are from 0 to 1.

56

00:03:44.060  -->  00:03:44.910
Oh that's interesting.

57

00:03:44.910  -->  00:03:48.270
So basically I could fit in probabilities between 0 and 1.

58

00:03:48.330  -->  00:03:53.850
The fact that the red dots the red observations are already either 0 1 and nowhere in between.

59

00:03:53.970  -->  00:03:56.060
Well that's simply because we already know the result.

60

00:03:56.070  -->  00:04:00.750
We already know that they're either there or there but for something we're predicting it kind of makes

61

00:04:00.750  -->  00:04:07.980
sense to say well I don't know for sure I don't know 100 percent he'll take it up or not by no maybe

62

00:04:08.490  -->  00:04:10.810
maybe an 80 percent chance he'll take it up or not.

63

00:04:10.980  -->  00:04:11.410
Right.

64

00:04:11.520  -->  00:04:16.770
And when you think of it that way the linear regression line or at least that part that's in the middle

65

00:04:16.800  -->  00:04:17.930
between 0 and 1.

66

00:04:18.030  -->  00:04:19.220
It makes sense right.

67

00:04:19.240  -->  00:04:26.580
Well it makes some sense because that is basically it's telling you that anybody between those ages

68

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:32.090
of for instance where it's crossing the horizontal line for the first time it might be or where is Horten

69

00:04:32.130  -->  00:04:38.970
crossing the horizontal axis it might be like 25 or 35 and we're crossing the vertical The horizontal

70

00:04:38.970  -->  00:04:39.390
axis.

71

00:04:39.390  -->  00:04:42.580
For one it might be let's say 55.

72

00:04:42.600  -->  00:04:50.740
So those people between 35 and 55 they anything in between any person that falls in between that age

73

00:04:50.970  -->  00:04:58.360
there is a probability of them taking up this offer and their probabilities is increasing as we move

74

00:04:58.360  -->  00:05:01.890
to the right as we take more and more older people are possibilities increasing.

75

00:05:02.020  -->  00:05:07.120
So the part of the linear regression in the middle kind of makes sense and we we can do something of

76

00:05:07.120  -->  00:05:07.410
it.

77

00:05:07.720  -->  00:05:13.630
But the parts that don't make sense at all are the ones at the top at the bottom because a probability

78

00:05:13.630  -->  00:05:15.100
can never be less than zero.

79

00:05:15.100  -->  00:05:16.360
It can never be above 1.

80

00:05:16.360  -->  00:05:20.100
So what is the linear regression trying to give us a hint about here.

81

00:05:20.290  -->  00:05:28.450
Well what it's probably saying what we could interpret as is that people above that age that nominal

82

00:05:28.480  -->  00:05:35.460
age we said 55 above that age they they are very very likely to take off or actually more than more

83

00:05:35.460  -->  00:05:38.650
than 100 percent so basically they're definitely taking it up.

84

00:05:38.740  -->  00:05:42.440
Anybody below 35 on the other side on the left.

85

00:05:42.610  -->  00:05:44.450
They're definitely not taking it.

86

00:05:44.590  -->  00:05:50.770
So essentially what we're saying is if we take that approach then we would have to replace the original

87

00:05:50.770  -->  00:05:55.210
line with a line that looks like that so let's just cut those bits off and replace them with horizontal

88

00:05:55.210  -->  00:06:04.810
parts and that would be the very basic but it still would be an attempt at creating a model for this

89

00:06:05.230  -->  00:06:11.010
situation so we would still be able to use this to make some sort of predictions and assumptions.

90

00:06:11.140  -->  00:06:16.250
That's a lot that's talk about the correlation between the action and the age of a person.

91

00:06:16.510  -->  00:06:24.220
So that's a very basic understanding and that's kind of the start of our understanding of intuition

92

00:06:24.220  -->  00:06:25.870
behind logistic regression.

93

00:06:26.080  -->  00:06:29.920
So let's see what the actual scientific approach is.

94

00:06:30.220  -->  00:06:36.760
So here we've got the line that we looked at and it is described by this equation.

95

00:06:36.760  -->  00:06:40.220
Now this part is going to be this is the most fun part of Beruf me.

96

00:06:40.570  -->  00:06:45.910
If you apply to this equation a sigmoid function which looks like that.

97

00:06:46.180  -->  00:06:54.850
So you put the Y into the sigmoid function in purple and then you solve for y from the purple box and

98

00:06:54.850  -->  00:06:58.950
you put y back into the blue box then you'll get the green box.

99

00:06:58.960  -->  00:07:03.490
So basically your linear regression will start to look like this.

100

00:07:03.520  -->  00:07:07.190
And this is the formula for logistic regression.

101

00:07:07.360  -->  00:07:16.040
And what that will do to chart which is most important this visual part it'll converted from the chart

102

00:07:16.050  -->  00:07:22.530
to really at the top to this new chart which is actually the logistic regression function.

103

00:07:23.020  -->  00:07:30.610
So if at this stage you're asking yourself what just happened then.

104

00:07:30.850  -->  00:07:31.830
You're not alone.

105

00:07:32.140  -->  00:07:37.580
The first time I saw this or I learned this this was the expression on my face.

106

00:07:37.890  -->  00:07:42.400
If you if you're told if two fatalities come through or for that that's super great that means you'll

107

00:07:42.410  -->  00:07:43.750
fly through this section.

108

00:07:43.840  -->  00:07:46.180
But if you're confused right now not a problem.

109

00:07:46.180  -->  00:07:48.500
I was the same when I was in your shoes.

110

00:07:48.610  -->  00:07:51.420
So let's take this step by step.

111

00:07:51.430  -->  00:07:54.740
Let's look at it step by step exactly what happened.

112

00:07:54.760  -->  00:07:59.710
So there's our graph there is our independent variable.

113

00:07:59.830  -->  00:08:03.090
There's our outcome yes or no.

114

00:08:03.100  -->  00:08:05.950
So that's the why the dependent variable.

115

00:08:06.490  -->  00:08:11.170
And there are observations in our data set based on these observations.

116

00:08:11.320  -->  00:08:18.220
And plus using this formula which we're going to take as given this is the logistic regression formula

117

00:08:18.880  -->  00:08:26.650
using this formula and these observations we come up with this line and what is important to understand

118

00:08:26.650  -->  00:08:28.900
here it's not a magical line.

119

00:08:28.990  -->  00:08:36.690
This line for the logistic regression is the same as a slope or a trend line for a linear regression

120

00:08:36.700  -->  00:08:36.730
.

121

00:08:36.730  -->  00:08:43.240
So basically what this line is doing is it is using the formula is falling to.

122

00:08:43.420  -->  00:08:47.770
And it's the best fitting line that can fit these daughters.

123

00:08:47.780  -->  00:08:53.920
And so basically we're doing exactly the same thing as a for linear regression but it just looks different

124

00:08:54.010  -->  00:08:54.430
that's all.

125

00:08:54.430  -->  00:08:59.830
So there are heaps of these lines that can you can draw that look like that but only one of them is

126

00:08:59.830  -->  00:09:00.910
the best fitting line.

127

00:09:00.910  -->  00:09:05.400
So the point of the logistic regression is to find that best fitting line.

128

00:09:05.530  -->  00:09:06.430
And this is it.

129

00:09:06.490  -->  00:09:15.580
So we found the best fitting line that follows that equation and fits these variables that we are these

130

00:09:15.580  -->  00:09:17.570
observations that we had in our data set.

131

00:09:17.590  -->  00:09:22.620
After that we can forget about the equation we forget about the wearables we've got online.

132

00:09:22.660  -->  00:09:28.710
So this is our logistic regression function we found and same thing as with the linear regression we've

133

00:09:28.730  -->  00:09:31.080
created the model we've built the model you can see it.

134

00:09:31.090  -->  00:09:34.190
This is the model in front of you right there.

135

00:09:34.460  -->  00:09:37.210
Now what can we do if this logistic regression.

136

00:09:37.240  -->  00:09:40.810
Well we can use it to predict probabilities.

137

00:09:40.870  -->  00:09:46.960
And we're already touched on probabilities that they lie between 0 and 1 and that instead of predicting

138

00:09:46.960  -->  00:09:49.000
for sure that something will or will not happen.

139

00:09:49.010  -->  00:09:50.460
Hubley predict probability.

140

00:09:50.680  -->  00:10:00.160
So let's look at oh by the way probability here is called p hat so that that's a little sign about P

141

00:10:00.310  -->  00:10:05.890
gives it the name p hat and anything you see in the hats in the section just basically means that it's

142

00:10:07.090  -->  00:10:08.720
something we're predicting so.

143

00:10:09.040  -->  00:10:12.610
And that's that's the way to remember that that picture.

144

00:10:12.780  -->  00:10:16.420
So we're predicting this probability OK.

145

00:10:16.430  -->  00:10:22.220
So let's take a for a random values for the independent variable for X.

146

00:10:22.230  -->  00:10:25.920
We're going to say 20 30 40 50 let's see what happens these variables.

147

00:10:26.000  -->  00:10:28.590
So let's put them on the X line.

148

00:10:28.620  -->  00:10:29.600
Those are the dots.

149

00:10:29.610  -->  00:10:36.470
And I specifically put dots not X's or crosses because it doesn't mean that they're on the horizontal

150

00:10:36.480  -->  00:10:43.060
The bottom line doesn't mean that the probability is 0 or that's their dependent variable is zero.

151

00:10:43.060  -->  00:10:48.100
No they're just there because they're on the x axis we just plotted them there has nothing to do with

152

00:10:48.140  -->  00:10:50.450
the vertical axis.

153

00:10:50.460  -->  00:10:55.860
Now let's what you need to do to find the probabilities is you need to project these values onto your

154

00:10:55.860  -->  00:10:56.470
curve.

155

00:10:56.780  -->  00:11:03.350
Once you project them you get these blue light blue blue dots or blue.

156

00:11:03.460  -->  00:11:05.870
Observations were plotted basically.

157

00:11:05.880  -->  00:11:10.400
So these are the fitted values as you remember in Grettel you have in red you have the actual And in

158

00:11:10.400  -->  00:11:12.050
blue you have the fitted values.

159

00:11:12.050  -->  00:11:13.890
So these are your fitted values.

160

00:11:14.340  -->  00:11:20.810
And now if you project them if you want to probabilities you need to project them to the left like that

161

00:11:21.360  -->  00:11:25.860
and let's have a look at these probabilities so the person who's 20 years old the possibility of taking

162

00:11:25.860  -->  00:11:27.210
up this offer is very low.

163

00:11:27.360  -->  00:11:34.580
Perhaps 0.7 percent so less than 1 percentage to take up this offer the person who's 30 years old the

164

00:11:34.590  -->  00:11:40.730
percent of the problem is higher is about 23 percent take up this offer the person who's 40 years old

165

00:11:41.490  -->  00:11:43.010
they're probably taken place offers.

166

00:11:43.030  -->  00:11:48.320
Eighty five percent according to this model and the person who's 50 years old there probably is ninety

167

00:11:48.330  -->  00:11:49.930
nine point four percent.

168

00:11:50.070  -->  00:11:55.310
So that's the first thing that she can get out of a logistic and that's what we're going to be using

169

00:11:55.320  -->  00:11:56.830
very.

170

00:11:57.020  -->  00:12:02.700
We're going to be using it very actively when we're talking about building Joe demographics augmentations

171

00:12:02.730  -->  00:12:05.140
because you use this probability as a score.

172

00:12:05.150  -->  00:12:11.430
And I will talk about this more so you can actually rank people who is the most likely to take up your

173

00:12:11.430  -->  00:12:13.920
friend who's the least likely to take you offer up.

174

00:12:13.910  -->  00:12:17.350
So it's actually even better than just having a 1 or 0.

175

00:12:17.410  -->  00:12:22.970
We have a probability so you can order people by this probability anyway.

176

00:12:23.420  -->  00:12:29.630
You might want to say well I don't want probability I want a prediction as because this is a regression

177

00:12:30.270  -->  00:12:30.680
.

178

00:12:30.840  -->  00:12:34.620
I want a prediction for the the y value.

179

00:12:34.720  -->  00:12:36.930
So OK we can do that.

180

00:12:37.110  -->  00:12:43.200
Can we get let's get rid of those probabilities now can we get the why the actual will.

181

00:12:43.200  -->  00:12:48.500
Obviously we can't get the actual Because the actual is something that we can only observe in in our

182

00:12:48.500  -->  00:12:50.060
data set or in real life.

183

00:12:50.150  -->  00:12:52.450
We can only get a prediction for the actual.

184

00:12:52.470  -->  00:12:59.870
So white hats as it has just is a predicted value for the dependent variable.

185

00:12:59.880  -->  00:13:00.870
How do you get why.

186

00:13:01.080  -->  00:13:03.650
Well the approaches are very arbitrary.

187

00:13:03.650  -->  00:13:05.540
You have to select a line.

188

00:13:06.290  -->  00:13:07.380
Let's wait for that OK.

189

00:13:07.500  -->  00:13:10.680
So you have to select a line in this case we're going to like 50 percent.

190

00:13:11.250  -->  00:13:16.520
You can cite it anywhere but 50 percent is usually selected because it's in the middle and it's therefore

191

00:13:16.520  -->  00:13:22.680
you have symmetry and anything below this line so anything that falls on the curve below this line will

192

00:13:22.670  -->  00:13:29.450
be projected downwards onto the zero line which makes sense so it's basically saying if you operability

193

00:13:30.010  -->  00:13:34.490
your predicted probability of taking up this offer is less than 50 percent let's say it's 40 percent

194

00:13:34.500  -->  00:13:38.570
or 20 percent then we're just going to say that you're not you're probably not going to take up this

195

00:13:38.580  -->  00:13:39.380
offer.

196

00:13:39.890  -->  00:13:46.310
And so that's what's happening and the person with 0.7 percent the person or whatever it was 27 percent

197

00:13:46.320  -->  00:13:54.860
23 percent their predicted their probabilities are not zero but they're below 50 so you are if you're

198

00:13:55.280  -->  00:13:57.650
if you're if you do require a y hat.

199

00:13:57.650  -->  00:14:03.960
So a predicted value or a yes or no value then makes sense that if something is below 50 percent you're

200

00:14:03.950  -->  00:14:07.280
probably going to say that they're not going to take up the offer now.

201

00:14:07.360  -->  00:14:08.330
And you think a.

202

00:14:08.390  -->  00:14:08.970
Oh yeah.

203

00:14:08.970  -->  00:14:10.100
So there you go.

204

00:14:10.160  -->  00:14:10.770
Both of them.

205

00:14:10.760  -->  00:14:17.900
Why has zero now anything above the horizontal line that we've selected the 50 percent line.

206

00:14:18.650  -->  00:14:25.400
It is agreed that all of those values that fall onto the curve above that line are projected upwards

207

00:14:25.410  -->  00:14:28.130
they're projected onto the yes line.

208

00:14:28.130  -->  00:14:29.220
The one what line.

209

00:14:29.490  -->  00:14:35.640
So the person that's had a probability of 85 percent is projected outwards and the person that had the

210

00:14:35.630  -->  00:14:38.180
possibility of ninety nine point seven percent is projected upwards.

211

00:14:38.180  -->  00:14:39.090
Also makes sense right.

212

00:14:39.090  -->  00:14:45.330
So if she if somebody is a child you predicting that somebody is possibility of taking up an offer of

213

00:14:45.360  -->  00:14:46.220
85 percent.

214

00:14:46.380  -->  00:14:51.050
Then if you have to say yes or no then you're probably going to say yes you're going to say yes this

215

00:14:51.060  -->  00:14:55.420
person will take up the offer if you just if you have to choose one of the two.

216

00:14:55.500  -->  00:14:58.210
So those are our predicted.

217

00:14:58.220  -->  00:15:04.250
Why have values in this case they're both one for those two variables.

218

00:15:04.560  -->  00:15:12.540
And those are the two things you can get out of the logistic regression so you get the probabilities

219

00:15:12.530  -->  00:15:16.460
which are important also you can get the Y had the predicted values for the dependent variables.

220

00:15:16.460  -->  00:15:21.570
Once again it's important to think of it as it's doing exactly the same thing as a linear regression

221

00:15:21.620  -->  00:15:21.810
.

222

00:15:21.910  -->  00:15:22.260
It's

223

00:15:25.130  -->  00:15:32.020
it's fitting this line even though it's not a straight line and the and the values are not scattered

224

00:15:32.010  -->  00:15:32.310
.

225

00:15:32.340  -->  00:15:39.600
Everything looks bizarre in its uniformity or in the structure its structure makes it look very bizarre

226

00:15:39.810  -->  00:15:48.020
but still it's it's a pretty much the same way we've agreed on a line or a formula for a curve.

227

00:15:48.140  -->  00:15:50.950
And we're tried to fit the best curve to our data.

228

00:15:51.060  -->  00:15:56.250
Once we've done that we've got we've got a model we've got the coefficients which we'll talk about later

229

00:15:56.510  -->  00:16:04.430
and we can start drawing conclusions or insights from this model and some of the insights are we can

230

00:16:04.430  -->  00:16:11.450
get a probability of somebody taking action or on that of the event occurring and or basically the answer

231

00:16:11.450  -->  00:16:17.670
being yes so it's not a yes no it's a probability so 85 percent or 20 percent or whatever so that's

232

00:16:17.720  -->  00:16:23.520
when we projected to the left onto the y axis and also we can get a predicted value for the depende

233

00:16:23.510  -->  00:16:28.960
Berbel based on where we select this arbitrary line 50 percent you can select it anywhere you like.

234

00:16:28.970  -->  00:16:35.030
You can say a higher lower depends on your knowledge about the problem at hand.

235

00:16:35.250  -->  00:16:40.860
And as you as you understand depending on where you select it that will significantly affect your variables

236

00:16:40.870  -->  00:16:41.130
.

237

00:16:41.390  -->  00:16:51.600
So I really hope this explanation was trivial enough and yet insightful enough for you to gain an intuitive

238

00:16:51.680  -->  00:16:53.450
understanding of logistic regression.

239

00:16:53.660  -->  00:16:58.960
And then in the next tutorial we will build our very first one in Criddle.

240

00:16:58.970  -->  00:17:00.150
I look forward to seeing you then.

241

00:17:00.260  -->  00:17:02.230
And until next I'm happy analyzing
