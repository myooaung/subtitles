1

00:00:00,530  -->  00:00:05,340
This the Tauriel I will show you everything about the select statement.

2

00:00:05,340  -->  00:00:07,810
It is a very simple operation in.

3

00:00:07,920  -->  00:00:10,540
SAGAL So it's going to be a very quick tutorial.

4

00:00:10,590  -->  00:00:16,770
So here we've got the select statement that allows us to select the top thousand rows of our table and

5

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:22,380
the way we got it was very simple it just right click on your table and you click select top tiles and

6

00:00:22,380  -->  00:00:24,850
rows and this statement is created for you.

7

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:27,870
So this up here at the top it's highlighted in green.

8

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:31,320
It is a comment you can simply delete it it doesn't do anything.

9

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:34,820
The statement here is civil lect from.

10

00:00:34,830  -->  00:00:41,440
So we're going to remove the top thousand because it's a constraint that tells skills or management

11

00:00:41,610  -->  00:00:46,770
that you only want the top thousand rows and as you can see here there is exactly 1000.

12

00:00:46,800  -->  00:00:51,620
Even though our table might contain more so we're just going to do that.

13

00:00:51,960  -->  00:00:57,510
And here what you see is select and then a list of columns that we're selecting.

14

00:00:57,510  -->  00:01:01,670
So if you want to specify a certain columned then you can.

15

00:01:01,680  -->  00:01:03,550
You don't have to specify all of them.

16

00:01:03,600  -->  00:01:10,530
So for instance we can specify just customer names so as to get rid of these and we'll just leave customer

17

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:14,740
name and country for instance so we'll leave these two columns.

18

00:01:14,880  -->  00:01:22,410
And here we've got select these two columns from this source or from this table that we're selecting

19

00:01:22,410  -->  00:01:22,620
from.

20

00:01:22,620  -->  00:01:29,490
So if we run this now you'll see that there's only two columns that have been selected customer name

21

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:30,380
and country.

22

00:01:30,720  -->  00:01:36,210
And in total there's much more than a thousand roses actually four thousand one hundred seventeen rows

23

00:01:36,210  -->  00:01:36,970
.

24

00:01:36,990  -->  00:01:42,120
Now let's look at how else we can select from the table.

25

00:01:42,510  -->  00:01:46,950
If you don't want to specify columns for instance like like Preuss you want all the callers you don't

26

00:01:46,950  -->  00:01:48,670
have to write all of them out.

27

00:01:48,720  -->  00:01:55,770
The most common way people you select is with a star and a star basically means I want to see all of

28

00:01:55,770  -->  00:01:58,030
the columns are available in the stable.

29

00:01:58,200  -->  00:02:02,900
So if you write select star from this table then you will get all the columns.

30

00:02:02,910  -->  00:02:04,060
Let's try that again.

31

00:02:04,250  -->  00:02:04,960
Execute.

32

00:02:05,100  -->  00:02:10,290
And so here you see that all of the columns have been selected and all of the rows in these columns

33

00:02:10,310  -->  00:02:10,610
.

34

00:02:10,920  -->  00:02:18,820
So basically now what we're going to look at is what is off to the FROM clause.

35

00:02:19,050  -->  00:02:24,450
Here you see three parts D.S. training TBO and list of orders.

36

00:02:24,660  -->  00:02:30,640
Right so D.S. training is the database that we're working in here.

37

00:02:30,870  -->  00:02:35,610
So that's Diest training then Debo is the schema.

38

00:02:35,610  -->  00:02:39,280
So we won't be talking about schemas because more of an advanced topic.

39

00:02:39,290  -->  00:02:47,430
However you can see here that there is a prefix is kind of like a prefix or think of it as a subfolder

40

00:02:47,440  -->  00:02:47,610
.

41

00:02:47,790  -->  00:02:53,780
So it's it's a prefix behind these tables would be for these tables.

42

00:02:54,060  -->  00:02:56,240
And so they're all D-B oles.

43

00:02:56,310  -->  00:03:01,850
So in this case we saying we want that subfolder of the database.

44

00:03:02,190  -->  00:03:07,830
And then finally a list of orders is the name of your table so that's the SO or is there.

45

00:03:08,490  -->  00:03:13,560
And that's how a select statement works so let's create a new select statement from scratch to create

46

00:03:13,560  -->  00:03:18,900
a new query just click the button here and you Quirino press control and on the keyboard that brings

47

00:03:18,900  -->  00:03:21,510
up an absolutely blank window.

48

00:03:21,510  -->  00:03:23,220
So what are we going to write.

49

00:03:23,220  -->  00:03:26,070
We're going to select from this other table order breakdown.

50

00:03:26,070  -->  00:03:36,240
So those go select star from there we we need the database name Diest training.

51

00:03:36,240  -->  00:03:39,930
You can use this pop up if you like to help you out.

52

00:03:40,090  -->  00:03:45,870
Then TBO by the way a skills not case sensitive you can write in lowercase uppercase.

53

00:03:45,870  -->  00:03:47,270
Mix it up if you want.

54

00:03:47,280  -->  00:03:51,110
And here it's already tell you which tables they are in.

55

00:03:51,150  -->  00:03:56,520
TBO actually is not showing all of the tables because I've just uploaded them so it's low on my machine

56

00:03:56,520  -->  00:03:58,670
so I'm just going to type it in.

57

00:03:58,830  -->  00:04:01,950
For us it's order break down.

58

00:04:02,610  -->  00:04:09,330
And if I click five or click execute here you can see that the columns all the columns of the table

59

00:04:09,330  -->  00:04:10,170
have been selected.

60

00:04:10,320  -->  00:04:14,610
So the beauty of select star is that you don't even have to know what is in that table.

61

00:04:14,610  -->  00:04:20,420
So if you're seeing this table for the first time you can just click type and select star and it'll

62

00:04:20,430  -->  00:04:26,220
bring up all the columns and you can investigate it's very useful for data mining and Dot investigation

63

00:04:26,220  -->  00:04:27,290
purposes.

64

00:04:27,600  -->  00:04:32,610
Once again because you don't need to know the table you can get to know it this way.

65

00:04:33,030  -->  00:04:33,260
OK.

66

00:04:33,270  -->  00:04:35,290
So that's how order break down.

67

00:04:35,370  -->  00:04:41,730
One more thing I wanted to show you is that it gets a bit annoying to write this part out because we

68

00:04:41,730  -->  00:04:44,600
know already we we're working in the Diest training database.

69

00:04:44,700  -->  00:04:49,140
So we just want to work with the tables rather than every time type this out.

70

00:04:49,500  -->  00:04:51,960
So there is a way you can do it.

71

00:04:52,110  -->  00:04:54,780
Let's get rid of this part.

72

00:04:54,780  -->  00:04:59,720
If I click execute now I'll get an error because it doesn't know where to look for this object.

73

00:04:59,790  -->  00:05:05,700
But at the top here there's a dropdown and you can select which database you want to work and then you

74

00:05:05,720  -->  00:05:13,070
Fusilier straining and you run the query now then everything is working fine however.

75

00:05:13,110  -->  00:05:18,300
Might be a bit tedious to change it every time so we're going to go back to master and here this is

76

00:05:18,300  -->  00:05:19,150
where we get the error.

77

00:05:19,350  -->  00:05:21,900
I will show you how to specify the database at top.

78

00:05:21,900  -->  00:05:23,630
All you have to type in is use.

79

00:05:24,030  -->  00:05:25,290
Then the name of your database.

80

00:05:25,290  -->  00:05:31,640
So for us it's d as training there's a pop up and after that type in go.

81

00:05:32,240  -->  00:05:37,530
And so if you run that now you will see that this database is selected automatically at the top and

82

00:05:37,530  -->  00:05:39,490
the table works.

83

00:05:39,570  -->  00:05:41,550
And so that's how you use this skill statement.

84

00:05:41,550  -->  00:05:48,000
It's one of the most important foundational elements of this scripting language.

85

00:05:48,300  -->  00:05:51,480
And we'll be using it quite a lot throughout the next Charles
