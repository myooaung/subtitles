00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:07.230
Building a data culture we are living in a time when data is taking over the world.

2

00:00:07.240  -->  00:00:08.660
There's so much data.

3

00:00:08.910  -->  00:00:14.530
It's just unbelievable and everything is going to be driven by daughters soon.

4

00:00:14.650  -->  00:00:20.730
Everything every process every sense or everything is going to be measured down and feeding it into

5

00:00:20.730  -->  00:00:27.290
the business world into any kind of processes that we are part of as human beings.

6

00:00:27.420  -->  00:00:34.680
And that is going to change the way things are done that is going to change the way business is conducted

7

00:00:34.690  -->  00:00:34.970
.

8

00:00:35.280  -->  00:00:39.520
And you know most right now people are expected to be able to use iPads.

9

00:00:39.540  -->  00:00:44.100
Ten years ago people didn't even didn't even know how to use iPads.

10

00:00:44.100  -->  00:00:47.830
Now it's an expectation that you know how to swipe and pretty much everybody knows how.

11

00:00:48.030  -->  00:00:53.850
Well in ten years from now I predict that everybody in every organization in the world is going to be

12

00:00:54.180  -->  00:01:03.360
expected to have some sort of level of data literacy and to be able to work of data and derive some

13

00:01:03.510  -->  00:01:09.310
sort of insights from data to make their work more efficient and to add value add additional value to

14

00:01:09.310  -->  00:01:09.820
this.

15

00:01:10.020  -->  00:01:17.850
And so as you're performing Dallasites work currently and you're talking with different people in different

16

00:01:17.850  -->  00:01:22.140
levels in your organization you're in the back of your head you should always have this thought that

17

00:01:22.140  -->  00:01:27.030
you should be creating a a culture you should be creating data advocates in your organization.

18

00:01:27.030  -->  00:01:27.940
What do I mean by that.

19

00:01:28.080  -->  00:01:36.660
Well basically you should show people how valuable data can be and how much additional efficiency you

20

00:01:36.660  -->  00:01:39.510
can bring to their work how easier it can make that work.

21

00:01:39.570  -->  00:01:44.670
How much more interesting can make the world interesting data is in general and you have to win them

22

00:01:44.670  -->  00:01:51.000
over so convert them to the to the light side to side of dollar don't make enemies of doubt and make

23

00:01:51.000  -->  00:01:51.790
friends of that.

24

00:01:51.840  -->  00:01:52.890
And why.

25

00:01:52.970  -->  00:01:53.520
Why do that.

26

00:01:53.520  -->  00:01:58.770
Well first of all because eventually it will happen and you're basically giving them you know helping

27

00:01:58.770  -->  00:01:59.130
them out.

28

00:01:59.130  -->  00:02:04.040
Now before this whole change happens when they will have to be data literate.

29

00:02:04.110  -->  00:02:09.470
But secondly they will help you out further on so they will drive your fame agenda.

30

00:02:09.900  -->  00:02:17.550
They will tell other people how much you help them in their role using God and people will be more open

31

00:02:17.820  -->  00:02:19.200
to you when you approach them.

32

00:02:19.320  -->  00:02:25.200
And also they will always give you ideas so even when you finish a project they will later come back

33

00:02:25.230  -->  00:02:30.210
and say hey I have these cool ideas you know maybe we can do something else with this data and you want

34

00:02:30.210  -->  00:02:39.660
to have these allies in the organization that are interested and willing to help you in your journey

35

00:02:39.690  -->  00:02:42.280
on making your organization more data driven.

36

00:02:42.420  -->  00:02:44.520
And you can do this regardless of the level you're at.

37

00:02:44.550  -->  00:02:50.970
You might say only as a manager can start creating a data culture in an organization and you know inspiring

38

00:02:50.970  -->  00:02:53.580
people to know that really anybody can do that.

39

00:02:53.700  -->  00:03:00.270
Even if you're delivering a project or just a bit of a project somebody just spent some time on explaining

40

00:03:00.270  -->  00:03:07.880
it to the people spend some time on actually showing it showing them how much value this has proven

41

00:03:07.890  -->  00:03:10.330
for the business and for this work specifically.

42

00:03:10.500  -->  00:03:11.330
I'll give you an example.

43

00:03:11.340  -->  00:03:20.460
So I did a project with a massive project on optimizing the efficiency of processing communications

44

00:03:20.460  -->  00:03:23.770
that were coming into company so there was a huge bottleneck.

45

00:03:23.820  -->  00:03:29.850
Customers were waiting for like 40 days before to get a reply from the company just because there was

46

00:03:29.850  -->  00:03:36.960
such a swarm of mail coming in and the 11 people are working on this project just simply didn't have

47

00:03:37.380  -->  00:03:42.660
the capacity to process that much incoming requests and was taking them 40 days to get back to customers

48

00:03:42.660  -->  00:03:49.800
on average and after I did some downsize work and did some optimization we reduced Sadako just three

49

00:03:49.800  -->  00:03:51.720
days from 40 days to three days.

50

00:03:51.720  -->  00:03:55.180
That's incredible That's like over 90 percent reduction in backlog.

51

00:03:55.350  -->  00:04:02.580
And that meant a lot and I mean a ton for the customers the business for the revenue for the experience

52

00:04:02.640  -->  00:04:03.920
and so on.

53

00:04:04.050  -->  00:04:10.170
But still after this project I went back to the department that was actually posting to those 11 people

54

00:04:10.160  -->  00:04:16.080
I took to the manager and I offered to present my findings and the results that we got to them so that

55

00:04:16.200  -->  00:04:21.140
I didn't have to do this because like they they're just proceeds to make their life easier.

56

00:04:21.150  -->  00:04:24.450
But they they didn't understand how this happened.

57

00:04:24.510  -->  00:04:30.660
So I spent the time to go back and present everything I found and exactly what we did to those 11 people

58

00:04:30.660  -->  00:04:30.970
.

59

00:04:31.020  -->  00:04:32.520
Do you know how happy they were.

60

00:04:32.520  -->  00:04:39.140
Do you know how grateful and satisfied they were that daughter was able to change the course of their

61

00:04:39.230  -->  00:04:44.820
day to day work was incredible is incredible to the looks on their faces but more importantly after

62

00:04:44.820  -->  00:04:51.450
that they kept coming back to me with more and more ideas on how further we can you know drive this

63

00:04:52.100  -->  00:04:57.540
these implementation's and increase the efficiency of the work so that's how you create data advocates

64

00:04:57.570  -->  00:05:02.280
and give it a go see how how you go about creating doubt.

65

00:05:02.340  -->  00:05:05.920
Because I'm sure people will be very open to that idea.

66

00:05:05.920  -->  00:05:07.300
Your organization as well.
