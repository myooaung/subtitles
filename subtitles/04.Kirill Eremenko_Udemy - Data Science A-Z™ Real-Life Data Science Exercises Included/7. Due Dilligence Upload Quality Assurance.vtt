Quality assurance or keyway is an important aspect of the work of a data scientist and we'll be talking

2

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:09.780
quite a bit about it throughout the course.

3

00:00:09.780  -->  00:00:13.190
Q8 is especially important in the e-tail phase.

4

00:00:13.200  -->  00:00:18.390
Imagine that an error occurs in your e-tail and you don't pick it up the rest of your work that you

5

00:00:18.390  -->  00:00:18.800
do.

6

00:00:18.840  -->  00:00:23.590
Often the tail is pointless because the underlying data is flawed.

7

00:00:23.610  -->  00:00:27.940
Today I'll show you some quick checks that you can do after you have uploaded your raw data.

8

00:00:27.960  -->  00:00:30.940
The first thing you should do is check the number of rows.

9

00:00:31.080  -->  00:00:36.750
Here's a handy trick on how to do it quickly after you have selected the top 1000 rows of your table

10

00:00:36.750  -->  00:00:36.900
.

11

00:00:36.900  -->  00:00:40.000
Highlight everything between select and from.

12

00:00:40.140  -->  00:00:41.790
Now delete this code.

13

00:00:41.790  -->  00:00:47.430
Replace it with simply count left bracket star right bracket.

14

00:00:47.730  -->  00:00:53.850
No click this read Exit could button up at the top as you can see as kill displays a number of rows

15

00:00:53.850  -->  00:00:56.520
in your table in the results window over here.

16

00:00:56.580  -->  00:01:02.460
There are 20 rows in this table and this is correct because we have 20 rows in the original data file

17

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:02.920
.

18

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:08.340
It is important to compare to the original data file and not the prepared or uploaded data you want

19

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:13.110
to make sure that the number of rows has not changed and you throw out your e-tail.

20

00:01:13.110  -->  00:01:18.780
Of course if you had deliberately deleted some rows in the preparation stage then the situation is different

21

00:01:18.780  -->  00:01:18.840
.

22

00:01:18.870  -->  00:01:24.990
In that case you need to compare this number to the number of rows in the file in the prepared folder

23

00:01:24.990  -->  00:01:25.620
.

24

00:01:25.620  -->  00:01:30.780
Another thing you can do is scroll through your data and make sure that no rows have been skewed.

25

00:01:30.930  -->  00:01:37.890
This process is similar to the check we did in Sosias simply look at the most right column and scroll

26

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:39.770
down throughout your file.

27

00:01:39.780  -->  00:01:45.190
Also you should check that the dates have been uploaded correctly in the year month day format.

28

00:01:45.240  -->  00:01:47.530
The same goes for any dullish Ballis.

29

00:01:47.550  -->  00:01:52.320
Make sure that there are no dollar signs or commas and that there are only two digits after the decimal

30

00:01:52.320  -->  00:01:53.100
.

31

00:01:53.100  -->  00:01:57.720
These are very trivial checks but they can help you catch errors that could have occurred during this

32

00:01:57.720  -->  00:02:00.860
phase of the jail and save you lots of time down the track
