00:00:00,970  -->  00:00:08,010
This story a little talk about ordering your tables now order in SQL doesn't have that much meaning

2

00:00:08,040  -->  00:00:08,750
at all.

3

00:00:08,790  -->  00:00:16,080
It's not like Excel where the way your table is order is important because people are visually assessing

4

00:00:16,080  -->  00:00:19,690
it and working with it and looking at it all the time.

5

00:00:19,690  -->  00:00:27,990
And Eskew well order has a much much lower importance because as Hill is a storage predominately storage

6

00:00:27,990  -->  00:00:36,300
facility and people don't normally look through tables in Haskell people usually use scripts and programs

7

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:42,060
to access these tables and if they do require the tables to be ordered then there are special functions

8

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:45,660
to do that or special commands to that which will look at just now.

9

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:51,840
But most of the time it's not required to order tables because you're just searching for specific values

10

00:00:51,840  -->  00:00:55,590
or you're aggregating values and you're manipulating the data.

11

00:00:55,590  -->  00:01:02,070
So in essence order doesn't matter and as you saw in the previous tutorials Of course sometimes when

12

00:01:02,070  -->  00:01:09,370
you're uploading the data it's ordered in one way in your text file or in your file on your hard drive

13

00:01:09,420  -->  00:01:11,700
and then when you've uploaded its order in a different way.

14

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:17,270
Well that's no surprise because a skill doesn't really care about order in the first place.

15

00:01:17,460  -->  00:01:24,900
All right so now we will look at ordering our tables in case you do need this functionality down the

16

00:01:24,900  -->  00:01:25,620
track.

17

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:31,510
Here I've got a simple selects a star from statement and we're selecting all the records from an order

18

00:01:31,580  -->  00:01:32,850
breakdown table.

19

00:01:32,850  -->  00:01:39,070
Now let's see what we can do if we want to order this table by product name for example.

20

00:01:39,350  -->  00:01:44,860
All you have to do is after your select statement and Officer and where clauses that you might have

21

00:01:44,860  -->  00:01:44,880
.

22

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:47,080
So where clauses of filters they come first.

23

00:01:47,190  -->  00:01:53,550
But after all that you just need to type in order by and then the column name that you want to order

24

00:01:53,550  -->  00:01:53,850
by.

25

00:01:53,850  -->  00:01:56,630
So in this case it's a product name.

26

00:01:56,760  -->  00:01:57,270
There it is.

27

00:01:57,270  -->  00:01:59,020
Product name and that's it.

28

00:01:59,020  -->  00:02:06,720
So if I exit this now you will see now that the table is ordered by alphabetically by the product name

29

00:02:07,220  -->  00:02:08,010
column.

30

00:02:08,610  -->  00:02:12,540
And you can scroll down and you'll see that we have a 2 x here.

31

00:02:12,570  -->  00:02:15,270
Now if you want to order the opposite way.

32

00:02:15,480  -->  00:02:23,100
So you want to add this and then you type in as after you order by statement just type in D and E C

33

00:02:23,760  -->  00:02:30,510
meaning descending and that will order it in descending order so X will be first and then a will be

34

00:02:30,510  -->  00:02:30,710
at.

35

00:02:30,720  -->  00:02:36,030
And now let's have a look at another example let's say we want to order by Salzer want the highest cells

36

00:02:36,030  -->  00:02:38,590
at the top and the lower cells at the top.

37

00:02:38,820  -->  00:02:47,730
Naturally what you would probably think of doing is typing in sales here and that would be correct.

38

00:02:47,730  -->  00:02:51,330
That's exactly how you would do it in a format a table.

39

00:02:51,330  -->  00:02:56,060
This is not a form Intel's table so let's what happens now so I'm going to highlight that and press

40

00:02:56,060  -->  00:02:57,440
a 5 on my keyboard.

41

00:02:57,870  -->  00:03:00,980
You can see that the highest sales are here.

42

00:03:00,990  -->  00:03:03,160
But then it's $99 after nine.

43

00:03:03,170  -->  00:03:07,690
Nine hundred ninety ninety nine and then it's again nine hundred.

44

00:03:07,860  -->  00:03:10,880
And then it's like it's a mix it's not what we wanted.

45

00:03:11,100  -->  00:03:20,100
Well the reason for that is because our table is not actually here you can see thousands of dollars

46

00:03:20,120  -->  00:03:20,320
.

47

00:03:20,490  -->  00:03:25,420
So the reason is that this table is formatted as Text.

48

00:03:25,530  -->  00:03:34,020
All of the columns are here as text so when you click when you're typing in order by sales sequel is

49

00:03:34,020  -->  00:03:40,670
recognizing sales as a text call and it's ordering it descending by say a by as if it would be working

50

00:03:40,700  -->  00:03:40,770
.

51

00:03:40,800  -->  00:03:48,810
Text and number nine in text comes after it comes last so anything that's starting with nine will come

52

00:03:48,810  -->  00:03:54,010
here first and then then they'll go the ace or go and the Sevens and so on.

53

00:03:54,150  -->  00:03:57,160
So basically a thousand It starts with a 1.

54

00:03:57,180  -->  00:04:00,670
So therefore it's very very far down somewhere here.

55

00:04:00,690  -->  00:04:00,990
Right.

56

00:04:01,020  -->  00:04:03,490
But in terms of value it's actually greater.

57

00:04:03,600  -->  00:04:09,150
So what do we need to do here is we either have to wait until we convert this table from our or table

58

00:04:09,150  -->  00:04:14,400
into a working table and we'll learn how to do that in the next session the course or in this specific

59

00:04:14,400  -->  00:04:21,240
example I'll show you how to work around this just so that you are comfortable that you can use the

60

00:04:21,240  -->  00:04:23,510
order by clause properly.

61

00:04:23,580  -->  00:04:29,700
So here we'll just quickly convert the sales call them into a number.

62

00:04:29,700  -->  00:04:38,500
So we'll use the cost operator just type in cost then a bracket and then say after sales say as.

63

00:04:38,760  -->  00:04:41,440
And then say float.

64

00:04:41,460  -->  00:04:45,840
So now this whole expression is a new value.

65

00:04:45,840  -->  00:04:53,640
It's taking sales which is text and changing it into a number with a decimal point which is a float

66

00:04:53,640  -->  00:04:53,700
.

67

00:04:53,700  -->  00:04:59,460
So now if I execute this you will see that everything is ordered correctly we even had six thousand

68

00:04:59,460  -->  00:05:01,180
dollar sales here.

69

00:05:01,380  -->  00:05:10,360
So here you can see that everything is in its actual order for value.

70

00:05:10,530  -->  00:05:17,280
Once again if this column had been formatted properly if it were a number already then you wouldn't

71

00:05:17,280  -->  00:05:21,000
have to do this cost a transitional step.

72

00:05:21,000  -->  00:05:28,580
So that's how you order your columns if you want to order the quantity then and sort of float put.

73

00:05:28,620  -->  00:05:36,450
Integer here so I.A. I give that a go see how you go if maybe discount quantity maybe order by category

74

00:05:36,870  -->  00:05:38,640
just so that you're comfortable by.

75

00:05:38,730  -->  00:05:46,080
We won't be using it much in this course if at all but it's good to know what the statement is.

76

00:05:46,110  -->  00:05:48,270
You might require it at some point
