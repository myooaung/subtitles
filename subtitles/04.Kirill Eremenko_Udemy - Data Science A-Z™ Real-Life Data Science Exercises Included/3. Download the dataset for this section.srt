1

00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:05,630
OK so let's get the data set for this section of the course as usual it's located at superdog assigns

2

00:00:05,640  -->  00:00:07,280
dot com slash training.

3

00:00:07,290  -->  00:00:16,290
Now if you scroll down to Part 3 data prep here you will see our data sets in section 6 each office

4

00:00:16,310  -->  00:00:23,660
3.0 wrangling after the load to files data customer list and transactional daughter.

5

00:00:23,730  -->  00:00:32,010
So both CACP files once you've downloaded them copy them into your folder for this section so into the

6

00:00:32,010  -->  00:00:32,780
project folder.

7

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:33,670
There it is.

8

00:00:33,750  -->  00:00:39,140
Now this is going to be a bit different to what we usually do in this case.

9

00:00:39,140  -->  00:00:46,790
I'm not going to show you the upload the e-tail process so phases 1 and 2 I'm not going to do it with

10

00:00:46,790  -->  00:00:47,010
you.

11

00:00:47,010  -->  00:00:49,710
I challenge you to do them on your own.

12

00:00:49,710  -->  00:00:50,980
There won't be.

13

00:00:50,980  -->  00:00:56,450
I'll give you a heads up there won't be any errors in the upload process.

14

00:00:56,580  -->  00:01:03,000
So if you get stuck or if you find any difficulties then just revert back to the previous sections to

15

00:01:03,000  -->  00:01:03,690
see how we did.

16

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:08,280
But this will be a good exercise for you to upload these files on your own.

17

00:01:08,370  -->  00:01:14,520
So you will need to upload both files and don't forget to disable the upload process once you've already

18

00:01:15,630  -->  00:01:16,700
uploaded one file.

19

00:01:16,710  -->  00:01:23,400
And then before you can commence uploading the second file and once you have uploaded these two data

20

00:01:23,410  -->  00:01:27,930
sets into raw files in your database and then proceed to the next Tauriel and we will pick it up from

21

00:01:27,930  -->  00:01:28,480
there.

22

00:01:28,740  -->  00:01:30,200
I look for see in the next Turl.

23

00:01:30,240  -->  00:01:32,010
And until then happy analyzing
