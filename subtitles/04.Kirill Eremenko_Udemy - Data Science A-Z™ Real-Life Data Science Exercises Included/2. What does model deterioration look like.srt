Model Deterioration.  This is going to be an exciting topic, maybe even unique
1

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,340
On the whole internet I'm not going to claim that but maybe because I haven't seen it anywhere else
2

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,360
.
3

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,670
We're going to find out how models deteriorate
4

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,680
What does it look like when a model deteriorates
5

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,090
All right
6

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:26,640
So we have our cup curve our cup curve is a very powerful tool that allows us to see our model to have
7

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,350
a graphical representation of our model which includes as well how well the model is performing.
8

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:39,150
And remember we had this rule of thumb that you look at the 50 percent and you what crosses
9

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,170
your model line where your cap line is crossed by this vertical 50 percent line
10

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,180
So and that allows you to determine how well your model is performing how good this model is
11

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,310
And we had this rule of thumb where anything below 60 percent is a rubbish model
12

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,850
Anything between 60 and 70 is a poor model
13

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,900
70 to 80 is good, 80 to 90 very good, 90 to 100 too good practically
14

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,560
Very unlikely that that can be achieved.
15

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,740
So let's observe a model over time and see how it will deteriorate.
16

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,800
It's going to be fun.
17

18
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,310
All right
18

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,810
So we start off with our model and at the top in the top left corner we're going to say how old it is
19

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,600
this a brand new model you just delivered it
20

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,980
You're very excited about it
21

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,270
Very proud
22

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,600
And it's performing at 81 percent at the 50 percent mark
23

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,850
So it's a very good model
24

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,000
And let's see what happens to it next, six months down the track.
25

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,280
How well is it performing a bit worse.
26

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,380
75 percent
27

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,970
So it is just a good model it's not a very good model anymore.
28

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,550
It's just a good model but still still pretty solid.
29

30
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,620
It's giving good results good predictions you can derive value from it.
30

31
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,860
Then 12 months down the track.
31

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,870
What do we see here -  69 percent
32

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:05,760
It just crossed into the poor path or the poor thresholds so as you remember a 60 to 70 is kind of like
33

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,720
a poor model but it's still around the 70 percent mark still may be driving insides not as good as when
34

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,900
it was brand new 81 percent but it's kind of still do.
35

36
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:24,480
alright, fairly alright right but venturing into the poor territory, another six months down the track after 18
36

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,410
months after deployment holes are moldering only 63 percent.
37

38
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,100
That is definitely a poor model can really derive a lot of value from that.
38

39
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:40,950
But you know we we are not maintaining it so let's see what happens six months later 24 months down
39

40
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,950
the track.
40

41
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,690
Fifty five percent.
41

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,240
And that is already a red flag a warning.
42

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:56,400
Fifty five percent is not much better than a random coin toss just a 5 percent increase on top of a
43

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,370
coin toss.
44

45
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:05,250
And like what's the point of having that model was the point of wasting processing power and actually
45

46
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,140
using it in business processes.
46

47
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,710
This is kind of already useless.
47

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,530
That's why we call them rubbish models.
48

49
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,420
Total rubbish model.
49

50
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,320
And believe it or not six months later even this can happen.
50

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,100
And I've actually seen one of these models where it's driving a negative driving negative value for
51

52
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,230
the business 42 percent when if you use a random coin toss you'll actually get a better result.
52

53
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,710
Definitely this model isn't just rubbish it's actually doing worse for the business.
53

54
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,310
So that's how a model can ditcher it over time.
54

55
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,700
The time frames used over here are completely out of the blue so it might not be a six month period
55

56
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,650
between each one of these might be 12 month period might be a three year period depends on the industry
56

57
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,420
it could be faster, it could be a month could be two months depends on the dynamics in the industry in the
57

58
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,370
company in the population in the country and the economic environment and so on.
58

59
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,970
So it depends on what you're modeling as well so if you're not modeling populace like people and your
59

60
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,980
customer base and so on if you're modeling defects in a factory then your model might last
60

61
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,900
longer but then if something changes, for instance, the plastic with the materials change then your model
61

62
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,010
start might start deteriorating.
62

63
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,550
So it all depends on the circumstances.
63

64
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,330
But models do deteriorate over time and we'll actually find out why in the next tutorial
64

65
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,700
Hope you enjoyed this one.
65

66
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,970
I definitely find it quite visual and hopefully it illustrates the concept of moral degeneration quite
66

67
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,480
well.
