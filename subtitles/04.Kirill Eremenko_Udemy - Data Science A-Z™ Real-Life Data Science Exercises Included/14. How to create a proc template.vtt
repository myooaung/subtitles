00:00:00.930  -->  00:00:06.660
Today we're going to talk about creating a template for our future projects.

2

00:00:06.690  -->  00:00:09.310
It's timesaving step basically.

3

00:00:09.420  -->  00:00:17.220
So what I would like to highlight is that we've created two prox the work office supplies were customer

4

00:00:17.220  -->  00:00:21.360
list and the transactional data and both of them very similar.

5

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:29.130
They have the blocks the drop table the create table the truncate table they insert into block very

6

00:00:29.130  -->  00:00:30.360
very simple A similar.

7

00:00:30.370  -->  00:00:35.130
They've got this common sense on so we don't want to redo this work every single time.

8

00:00:35.130  -->  00:00:40.970
And even the way we created the transactional data Proc. we used the original proc as a basis.

9

00:00:41.070  -->  00:00:46.980
So why not create a template that you can use every single time and you just have to fill in these blocks

10

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:48.690
and that's exactly how I work.

11

00:00:48.690  -->  00:00:55.410
That's exactly how you know people who want to be very efficient with their work because that's how

12

00:00:55.410  -->  00:01:00.960
they go about it because you have to sometimes you have to create maybe ten of these in a day.

13

00:01:00.960  -->  00:01:05.970
Depends on the on the number of tables that you're working with and so on.

14

00:01:05.970  -->  00:01:11.070
So let's let's go ahead and create a template as we did previously.

15

00:01:11.070  -->  00:01:15.640
We're going to change this to create So we don't override our previous work.

16

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:24.150
And here we're going to give it a template name so we'll start with double underscore the NPL double

17

00:01:24.150  -->  00:01:28.170
underscore basically anything you like put put in at the start.

18

00:01:28.320  -->  00:01:34.080
I really suggest starting with an underscore an exclamation mark because that way this proc will be

19

00:01:34.500  -->  00:01:38.700
at the top of all of your prox and you will be it'll be very easy to find it will be lost somewhere

20

00:01:38.700  -->  00:01:39.510
in the middle.

21

00:01:39.510  -->  00:01:42.210
Then you just keep the building that we are ok.

22

00:01:42.510  -->  00:01:44.360
Office supplies transactional data.

23

00:01:44.360  -->  00:01:45.240
What was that for us.

24

00:01:45.240  -->  00:01:47.070
That was the name of the table right.

25

00:01:47.070  -->  00:01:51.200
So we're going to say table name.

26

00:01:52.020  -->  00:01:59.760
And so then you can just simply replace it when when you need to and now or we're going to delete the

27

00:01:59.760  -->  00:02:07.140
author delete the create date description will keep the description because it's always going to be

28

00:02:07.140  -->  00:02:08.640
the same description.

29

00:02:09.120  -->  00:02:12.670
And now we'll take this table name work.

30

00:02:12.690  -->  00:02:14.870
Office supplies transactional data.

31

00:02:15.150  -->  00:02:23.790
So we'll replace that here because now we're creating this table work table name well the table name

32

00:02:23.790  -->  00:02:24.800
will be replaced.

33

00:02:24.790  -->  00:02:28.010
When when this template is used.

34

00:02:28.350  -->  00:02:35.670
Table name here is well create table replace.

35

00:02:35.760  -->  00:02:39.030
Once again you can use a fine research or place functionality.

36

00:02:39.060  -->  00:02:45.200
I'm just going through all the rows so it's more like a specific what we're doing here.

37

00:02:45.210  -->  00:02:46.760
You want to keep the wrong number.

38

00:02:46.770  -->  00:02:51.210
The rest you don't want to keep them but like you can just delete that like like that.

39

00:02:51.210  -->  00:02:58.070
But you want to give give yourself a bit more like a more of a hint of what's going on here or maybe

40

00:02:58.150  -->  00:03:06.500
not a hint maybe like just say a timesavers So let's just put in a random name like let's call it AAA

41

00:03:06.520  -->  00:03:07.090
.

42

00:03:07.680  -->  00:03:18.760
So we'll keep one of each so an A for var char a Warszawa one one hundred let's copy this one here is

43

00:03:19.110  -->  00:03:23.380
on old b b b b.

44

00:03:23.550  -->  00:03:33.360
This one is going I wanted a DVD for date and let's say we and let's keep an intern afloat so just that

45

00:03:33.360  -->  00:03:35.340
you don't have to retype even these types

46

00:03:38.080  -->  00:03:39.800
either.

47

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:43.320
And the floats is going to be f f.

48

00:03:43.620  -->  00:03:46.070
Hey that's that's pretty that's pretty good coincidence.

49

00:03:46.080  -->  00:03:50.650
All right so then when you're working with this you will know you already have all this prepared so

50

00:03:50.670  -->  00:03:55.290
just keep the row number and then you'll use the ones from here you want to you'll just say if you want

51

00:03:55.740  -->  00:03:58.970
10 10 bar charge you just quickly clone them.

52

00:03:59.020  -->  00:04:00.210
Oh my bad.

53

00:04:00.690  -->  00:04:08.460
You clone them like that and then you just replace the column names with what you want from the other

54

00:04:08.460  -->  00:04:11.510
table that you're going to be importing.

55

00:04:11.520  -->  00:04:14.010
So that's this part.

56

00:04:14.100  -->  00:04:20.550
Now we're going to move on truncate this table insert into this table.

57

00:04:20.760  -->  00:04:22.450
Same thing here.

58

00:04:22.680  -->  00:04:24.630
Take that.

59

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:26.410
Take that.

60

00:04:26.520  -->  00:04:28.870
Get rid of these.

61

00:04:30.330  -->  00:04:30.960
OK.

62

00:04:31.080  -->  00:04:35.190
And then finally here order I.

63

00:04:35.200  -->  00:04:37.850
Nor do I have order idea shouldn't have order ID here.

64

00:04:37.890  -->  00:04:39.480
Just a.

65

00:04:40.350  -->  00:04:44.090
And then finally selects similar.

66

00:04:44.340  -->  00:04:51.770
So just also give yourself a hint like this.

67

00:04:51.810  -->  00:04:57.490
It's called X X just because the name can be different.

68

00:04:57.540  -->  00:05:07.050
Actually we'll just called x a and then we'll just keep one of the converts maybe SBB it's up to you

69

00:05:07.050  -->  00:05:08.820
how you set up your template really.

70

00:05:09.340  -->  00:05:18.720
I'm just being a bit over the top right now so we'll just keep this one as maybe x c c c word so you

71

00:05:18.720  -->  00:05:25.830
don't confuse yourself or even somebody else just in case let's call it execs that said this one will

72

00:05:25.830  -->  00:05:30.060
call it that way.

73

00:05:31.350  -->  00:05:36.770
And this one maybe I don't know call it VB.

74

00:05:36.780  -->  00:05:40.770
So there you go so that's that part where are you selecting from.

75

00:05:40.830  -->  00:05:44.800
Obviously the table name is going to be the same in here.

76

00:05:45.060  -->  00:05:46.590
And then you got to put in a date

77

00:05:51.990  -->  00:05:54.400
and don't forget to change this to an X..

78

00:05:54.480  -->  00:05:55.680
And here as well so

79

00:05:58.380  -->  00:06:00.410
roll and then work.

80

00:06:00.690  -->  00:06:05.430
And also the beauty about the template that we've actually changed everywhere.

81

00:06:06.000  -->  00:06:07.580
Worktable them right.

82

00:06:07.590  -->  00:06:11.790
So whenever you need to use this template let me just say it quickly somebody I'm just going to create

83

00:06:11.790  -->  00:06:15.300
this proc and now you'll see it here.

84

00:06:15.900  -->  00:06:18.570
Oops there it is.

85

00:06:18.570  -->  00:06:26.160
So whenever we use this template now we can just take for instance work table name or just take table

86

00:06:26.160  -->  00:06:34.380
name Yep and we can just use a search and replace functionality so control whereas at contrl H and you

87

00:06:34.380  -->  00:06:36.710
just replace it let's say My.

88

00:06:37.010  -->  00:06:43.350
My table name is fraud investigation.

89

00:06:44.010  -->  00:06:46.400
And I replace all of them.

90

00:06:46.530  -->  00:06:50.830
Now I don't even have to do the work it's already done for me fraud investigations been done.

91

00:06:50.850  -->  00:06:52.770
I just have to get rid of the temple.

92

00:06:53.020  -->  00:06:53.990
OK that's good.

93

00:06:54.090  -->  00:06:57.510
Even in the raw tables fraud investigation has been placed.

94

00:06:57.600  -->  00:07:02.660
All I have to do now is take this date and replace it for the day the correct day.

95

00:07:02.660  -->  00:07:05.360
2015 what is it date.

96

00:07:05.390  -->  00:07:06.200
Eleventh.

97

00:07:06.330  -->  00:07:07.280
Replace All.

98

00:07:07.380  -->  00:07:09.080
OK so that's also done for me.

99

00:07:09.220  -->  00:07:15.300
And the only thing I have to do is set up the columns set up the insert into and the select statements

100

00:07:15.300  -->  00:07:18.860
I've you've got old templates I don't need any converts or just get rid of this whole bit.

101

00:07:19.140  -->  00:07:20.880
And I just put in my columns here.

102

00:07:20.880  -->  00:07:23.910
So it's very fast and efficient and you've got that template over there.

103

00:07:24.060  -->  00:07:29.300
So I'm not going to recompile those because I don't want for an investigation of one table name going

104

00:07:29.300  -->  00:07:31.950
to cause that going to modify.

105

00:07:32.230  -->  00:07:39.420
And yet you go as you see you have this Proc. every single time so whenever you need it you just modify

106

00:07:39.780  -->  00:07:41.980
get rid of this change a name and you're off.

107

00:07:42.030  -->  00:07:43.300
You're good to go.

108

00:07:43.770  -->  00:07:48.930
So that's how you create a template and you can see that it is sitting here at the very top of all of

109

00:07:48.960  -->  00:07:51.700
our other products which is very very handy.
