1

00:00:00,380  -->  00:00:03,380
And the person you're always talking about odds and how they're linked to probability.

2

00:00:03,390  -->  00:00:08,490
And today we're finally going to get to the bottom of this challenge with the coefficient of logistic

3

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:09,210
regression.

4

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:13,520
I got to warn you right now it's going to be a math heavy to Tauriel.

5

00:00:13,540  -->  00:00:19,250
So you have been warned let's proceed with care.

6

00:00:19,260  -->  00:00:24,570
Last I waited on the operability when to lose all odds because probability divided by one mile per billion

7

00:00:24,570  -->  00:00:24,600
.

8

00:00:24,600  -->  00:00:31,140
Basically this is the form that links your odds ratio to your pribumi So when you hear people say the

9

00:00:31,140  -->  00:00:33,310
odds of this team winning are ten to one.

10

00:00:33,330  -->  00:00:36,110
Now you know how to convert that to probability.

11

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:37,720
Basically use this formula.

12

00:00:37,800  -->  00:00:41,860
Well this one actually converts pre-built into into his odds ratio.

13

00:00:41,940  -->  00:00:46,470
But we also looked at the other equation that works in the opposite direction.

14

00:00:46,470  -->  00:00:47,670
So we'll be using this equation.

15

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:50,190
And let's quickly transform it into this one.

16

00:00:50,190  -->  00:00:55,360
So from now on when we say odds we mean when to lose odds All right.

17

00:00:55,410  -->  00:01:01,950
Now do you remember this from way back when we were talking about logistic regression how probability

18

00:01:01,950  -->  00:01:07,020
is linked to an independent variable x in this case.

19

00:01:07,320  -->  00:01:10,370
Well do you remember the equation that actually describes this curve.

20

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:11,170
There it is.

21

00:01:11,190  -->  00:01:13,490
I'll remind you there that's a question.

22

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:19,890
It's a logarithm of a p divided by one minus be equals bizzarro Plus the 1 x.

23

00:01:19,890  -->  00:01:25,260
So this is in the case of a simple logistic regression and this put the two equations side by side.

24

00:01:25,260  -->  00:01:29,670
So this is the one we the green ones the one we've talked about we talked about a long time ago when

25

00:01:29,670  -->  00:01:36,840
we were just introducing a logistic regression and the one on the right is the new equation that we

26

00:01:36,840  -->  00:01:39,710
now know for the odds ratio.

27

00:01:39,780  -->  00:01:40,330
Geez.

28

00:01:40,350  -->  00:01:45,450
Notice any similarities here like on the left on the right there.

29

00:01:45,540  -->  00:01:47,280
The ratio is actually the same one.

30

00:01:47,280  -->  00:01:54,380
So what we can do is take the Pido out but one must be and plug it into the first equation as ords.

31

00:01:54,510  -->  00:01:57,010
And that in that way will get this equation.

32

00:01:57,180  -->  00:02:03,580
So this is ligand logarithm of awes equals to be 0 plus 1 x.

33

00:02:03,630  -->  00:02:06,140
It actually has a special name log on.

34

00:02:06,180  -->  00:02:08,400
So that part on the left is called log odds.

35

00:02:08,670  -->  00:02:14,450
And then just for reference we're worried we won't be talking about log orders at all.

36

00:02:14,550  -->  00:02:19,690
We will be focusing on odds because that's what we want to get to the bottom of.

37

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:27,090
Now this equation is exactly the same for a multiple logistic regression or just the logistic regression

38

00:02:27,150  -->  00:02:35,190
in general so that's what our geo demographic segmentation would look like in terms of odds.

39

00:02:35,190  -->  00:02:40,350
Now what we can do with this equation is do a mathematical operation it's called taking exponent of

40

00:02:40,350  -->  00:02:40,470
it.

41

00:02:40,470  -->  00:02:44,750
So we'll take the exponent of both sides of the equation which will give us this.

42

00:02:44,760  -->  00:02:51,540
So each of the power of LUGG natural logarithm of AWS equals each the power of that whole right part

43

00:02:51,540  -->  00:02:51,900
.

44

00:02:51,900  -->  00:02:54,000
Now the left part of the equation is very simple.

45

00:02:54,000  -->  00:02:59,670
Each of the power of the natural logarithm of anything equals that anything which is in the brackets

46

00:02:59,670  -->  00:02:59,710
.

47

00:02:59,710  -->  00:03:04,950
So basically Odd's the right side can be broken down by replacing addition in the power of the exponent

48

00:03:05,310  -->  00:03:08,510
with multiplications of the exponent itself.

49

00:03:08,700  -->  00:03:10,750
And this brings us to this equation.

50

00:03:10,920  -->  00:03:14,250
So this a very nice and fluffy equation to work with.

51

00:03:14,490  -->  00:03:18,480
What are we going to explore is one individual in different variables.

52

00:03:18,480  -->  00:03:24,330
So let's just take any random What are we here let it be be one x 1 and let's look at it separately

53

00:03:24,360  -->  00:03:24,530
.

54

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:26,740
Now what will happen.

55

00:03:27,030  -->  00:03:33,240
And this is what we're actually interested in this is what we want to find out what will happen if instead

56

00:03:33,240  -->  00:03:40,500
of if we hold everything else constant but we increase X one by one unit of that variable what will

57

00:03:40,500  -->  00:03:43,760
happen to the odds what will happen to this whole equation.

58

00:03:44,100  -->  00:03:49,000
Well as you can see here on the right if we take each of the power of be 1 times X one plus one that

59

00:03:49,090  -->  00:03:54,630
is actually equal to each of the power of B1 X1 times each of the power of the one.

60

00:03:54,630  -->  00:04:01,500
Now here you can notice that each of the power of BE1 X1 is that part of the equation as it was before

61

00:04:01,500  -->  00:04:03,200
we increased X one by one unit.

62

00:04:03,270  -->  00:04:05,920
So the new part is this part over here.

63

00:04:05,970  -->  00:04:08,300
Each of the power of big one.

64

00:04:08,400  -->  00:04:14,250
That is what happens the orders they get multiplied by a factor of each will be one.

65

00:04:14,310  -->  00:04:18,490
And this is the part where you shot Erica.

66

00:04:18,510  -->  00:04:19,440
We got it.

67

00:04:19,440  -->  00:04:21,450
This is what we were after.

68

00:04:21,450  -->  00:04:27,850
Now let's put this in writing so that we definitely remember what we just found out.

69

00:04:28,110  -->  00:04:31,660
You know how I don't like putting too much text on my slides but this time is an exception.

70

00:04:31,720  -->  00:04:38,120
More important conclusion and we'll get to write it out increasing an independent variable x i.

71

00:04:38,130  -->  00:04:46,790
So any any independent variable x by one unit will increase the odds by a multiplicative factor of each

72

00:04:46,850  -->  00:04:48,620
of the power of PIII.

73

00:04:48,690  -->  00:04:55,530
So that's exactly what we talked about here that if you increase X one by one unit then your odds will

74

00:04:55,530  -->  00:05:03,570
actually get multiplied by E to the power of the coefficients of x1 which is be one very very important

75

00:05:03,570  -->  00:05:04,190
conclusion.

76

00:05:04,200  -->  00:05:05,920
Very very insightful.

77

00:05:05,940  -->  00:05:07,840
And don't forget we're not talking about probability.

78

00:05:07,890  -->  00:05:09,430
We're talking about odds here.

79

00:05:09,660  -->  00:05:12,120
So the odds that we discussed in the previous tutorial.

80

00:05:12,780  -->  00:05:15,480
So now let's look at an example.

81

00:05:15,480  -->  00:05:21,870
This is our model from previously the world we built for our judgment graphics segmentation.

82

00:05:22,260  -->  00:05:24,190
And here we've got a variable called age.

83

00:05:24,210  -->  00:05:28,200
Let's look at what happens when we increase age by 1.

84

00:05:28,260  -->  00:05:39,750
So our Asper our conclusion the odds will increase by each of the power of the age b age is the coefficient

85

00:05:39,750  -->  00:05:40,510
of age here.

86

00:05:40,800  -->  00:05:47,780
So that means each other of 0.07 2 6 5 0 and that equals to 1 0 7 5 or so.

87

00:05:47,780  -->  00:05:52,230
This means that whenever you increase age by one year.

88

00:05:52,260  -->  00:05:57,150
So if you take two people and hold everything else constant all of the other variables credit score

89

00:05:57,300  -->  00:06:04,420
number of products is active meme members the gender the country the tenure and the longer their balance

90

00:06:04,440  -->  00:06:06,740
you can hold those other variables constant.

91

00:06:06,750  -->  00:06:14,220
But one of those people is older by one year than the other then the older person their odds of leaving

92

00:06:14,220  -->  00:06:18,900
the bank increase by 1 point 0 7 5.

93

00:06:19,200  -->  00:06:23,840
So they get multiplied by this factor of point 0 7 5.

94

00:06:24,240  -->  00:06:26,100
So what does that give us that gives us two things.

95

00:06:26,100  -->  00:06:34,560
First of all we now know as as actually we did previously that if you increase age the odds will increase

96

00:06:34,710  -->  00:06:39,390
meaning that the probability will increase because remember that if you increase probability increases

97

00:06:39,600  -->  00:06:43,920
if or decrease probability with Chris but the second the more important thing is that now we have a

98

00:06:43,920  -->  00:06:50,340
quantifiable metric to tell by how much exactly the odds will increase.

99

00:06:50,340  -->  00:06:53,090
How many times what's the multiplicative factor.

100

00:06:53,100  -->  00:06:58,470
And that is very powerful because it will allow us to compare the different independent variables and

101

00:06:58,800  -->  00:07:05,220
their contribution to this model and we'll do that we'll start doing that in the next tutorial.

102

00:07:05,310  -->  00:07:06,720
And I think 14 next time.

103

00:07:06,720  -->  00:07:08,220
Until then happy analyzing
