00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:02.850
Are done with the math Hope you survived that.

2

00:00:02.850  -->  00:00:09.030
Hope you powered through and got some valuable insights and knowledge from the previous couple of tutorials

3

00:00:09.050  -->  00:00:09.170
.

4

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:11.920
And today we're off to the fun part.

5

00:00:11.940  -->  00:00:13.230
We're going to work with Grettel.

6

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:19.200
We're going to recreate our model and I'll show you how to get the odds ratios for your coefficients

7

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:20.780
in your logistic regression.

8

00:00:20.870  -->  00:00:26.760
And then I'll show you how to take them and export them into Excel and then actually we'll show you

9

00:00:26.760  -->  00:00:32.370
how to put them into PowerPoint and I will show you the way I would go about presenting them to your

10

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:33.940
manager or to an executive.

11

00:00:34.020  -->  00:00:34.790
And so on.

12

00:00:35.130  -->  00:00:40.850
So the knowledge that you'll gain in this material will be applicable regardless of what tool using

13

00:00:40.860  -->  00:00:42.080
just like everything that we're learning.

14

00:00:42.150  -->  00:00:47.760
Regardless of what tool you're going to be using for modeling you're going to be able to apply this

15

00:00:47.760  -->  00:00:50.430
knowledge in your work.

16

00:00:50.430  -->  00:00:50.750
All right.

17

00:00:50.760  -->  00:00:52.170
So let's get straight into it.

18

00:00:52.440  -->  00:00:55.770
So I've already got a grill open up somewhere over here.

19

00:00:55.770  -->  00:00:57.230
There it is.

20

00:00:57.270  -->  00:01:02.450
And before you do anything don't post this video before you do anything before you recreate the model

21

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:03.650
just like I did.

22

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:05.160
You have to do one other thing.

23

00:01:05.190  -->  00:01:08.050
As always you'll have to do the work twice.

24

00:01:08.370  -->  00:01:11.670
And so just go to file and we're going to install a package.

25

00:01:11.730  -->  00:01:15.410
I'll explain what I'm doing now and then you'll recreate the model so don't create the model for now

26

00:01:15.440  -->  00:01:17.760
just just watch his explanation.

27

00:01:17.760  -->  00:01:23.850
So if I go to moral and I run the model already done the coefficients here and everything is is ready

28

00:01:23.850  -->  00:01:30.660
to run if I run this model Now you'll notice that it doesn't have any information on the observation

29

00:01:30.670  -->  00:01:30.760
.

30

00:01:30.750  -->  00:01:36.930
So this is like like we're used to seeing what we're used to seeing but other packages other software

31

00:01:36.930  -->  00:01:43.470
packages for modeling they will add another Komori here which tells you about the odds ratio so it already

32

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:46.920
knows that you want to take the exponent of the coefficients.

33

00:01:46.920  -->  00:01:48.680
So we'll do that for you and add another column.

34

00:01:48.690  -->  00:01:50.050
Grinnel doesn't do that.

35

00:01:50.190  -->  00:01:54.800
But we can there's a workaround we can install a package that'll help us get that information so just

36

00:01:54.930  -->  00:01:59.160
close that we'll I'll close that before you create more of what you need to do in Grettel as you go

37

00:01:59.160  -->  00:02:10.500
to file actually go to Tools go to function packages go to server and here scroll down and find a package

38

00:02:10.500  -->  00:02:13.670
which starts with the letter O as called odds ratios.

39

00:02:13.680  -->  00:02:16.600
So once you found that it's by Ricardo Jack.

40

00:02:16.650  -->  00:02:21.660
So once you've done that click Install right click and click install it it's install.

41

00:02:21.660  -->  00:02:25.300
My one doesn't ask me to restart Grettel because I already had it installed.

42

00:02:25.440  -->  00:02:32.130
But yours will Huskie to restart Grinnel So that's why I warned you from creating the model because

43

00:02:32.150  -->  00:02:36.410
you would have to restart grid and you would lose all of that so once you've installed it restart Grettel

44

00:02:36.480  -->  00:02:38.780
and then you will create the model.

45

00:02:39.020  -->  00:02:39.410
All right.

46

00:02:39.420  -->  00:02:44.940
Now assuming that you've installed the package go ahead and import your data said which is chern modeling

47

00:02:44.940  -->  00:02:45.860
Dotsie a suite.

48

00:02:46.200  -->  00:02:51.720
And as we did previously create the dummy variables for geography for gender and create this new variable

49

00:02:51.720  -->  00:02:54.600
load balance which is locked and balance plus one.

50

00:02:54.660  -->  00:03:02.250
And now we're going to go run the model so model limited logic binary and as you can see here I already

51

00:03:02.250  -->  00:03:08.490
have the variables and I use that file that was saved a while back to remind me which variables we decided

52

00:03:08.490  -->  00:03:11.790
to keep and I've put on show p values.

53

00:03:11.790  -->  00:03:18.860
So just copy them from either that file or from my screen and once you've done that click OK.

54

00:03:19.260  -->  00:03:27.000
And here we have the model and as we had it previously right but now we know what extra thing we know

55

00:03:27.000  -->  00:03:30.700
something special about the coefficients that we can now interpret them.

56

00:03:30.960  -->  00:03:33.530
And isn't that isn't that a bit exciting.

57

00:03:33.690  -->  00:03:39.510
So what we can do if these coefficients we can take an exponent of the coefficients and that will tell

58

00:03:39.510  -->  00:03:43.800
us how the how the odds ratio is impacted.

59

00:03:43.800  -->  00:03:48.170
When you have a 1 unit change in the underlying variable.

60

00:03:48.180  -->  00:03:51.630
Now we don't have that column as discussed but after you've installed the package.

61

00:03:51.660  -->  00:03:57.930
If you go to analysis there'll be a new menu here which is a legit odds ratios and if you click that

62

00:03:58.920  -->  00:04:06.960
you will get the odds ratios So basically the multiplicative factors that will be applied to your odds

63

00:04:06.960  -->  00:04:07.750
ratio.

64

00:04:07.830  -->  00:04:17.040
If your variable the underlying variable is increased by one unit so this is the really cool part.

65

00:04:17.040  -->  00:04:22.950
Now we get to take all of this and put it into one Excel spreadsheet preparing it for our reports so

66

00:04:22.950  -->  00:04:23.940
there is Excel.

67

00:04:24.180  -->  00:04:25.290
What are going to do now.

68

00:04:25.410  -->  00:04:28.230
I'll well I'll move it here somewhere.

69

00:04:28.620  -->  00:04:30.290
I'm going to take all of this.

70

00:04:30.330  -->  00:04:37.090
I'm going to go file edit actually copy and I will copy it as this comma separated.

71

00:04:37.200  -->  00:04:40.360
OK copied there.

72

00:04:40.380  -->  00:04:41.610
Perfect.

73

00:04:41.610  -->  00:04:48.570
Now I'm going to take this and I'm going to it has to be about and then copy just plain text is fine

74

00:04:48.580  -->  00:04:48.870
.

75

00:04:49.760  -->  00:04:51.750
And I'm going to paste it somewhere here.

76

00:04:51.920  -->  00:04:56.960
Right so now I'm going to select this column so I'm going to zoom in a bit for you to see better.

77

00:04:56.960  -->  00:05:01.070
All right so pretty much we've taken all the information about a model from Grendal and we've put it

78

00:05:01.100  -->  00:05:02.920
into Excel.

79

00:05:02.930  -->  00:05:03.200
Great.

80

00:05:03.200  -->  00:05:04.710
Now let's make it look pretty.

81

00:05:05.090  -->  00:05:07.790
I'm going to select this column just for this.

82

00:05:07.880  -->  00:05:12.980
All the racial stuff because as you can see the information here is just is and one is in each cell

83

00:05:12.980  -->  00:05:16.280
just a long line of information.

84

00:05:16.310  -->  00:05:17.150
So I like to call them.

85

00:05:17.150  -->  00:05:22.810
I'm going to go to data text to columns of favorite will go delimited.

86

00:05:23.080  -->  00:05:27.140
I will just like space forget about tabs like space make sure that it's checked.

87

00:05:27.140  -->  00:05:31.310
Treat consecutive delimiter as one the next and just click Finish.

88

00:05:31.360  -->  00:05:31.730
There you go.

89

00:05:31.730  -->  00:05:32.980
So now it's all separated.

90

00:05:32.990  -->  00:05:34.040
Great.

91

00:05:34.100  -->  00:05:36.140
Now we have these variables right.

92

00:05:36.140  -->  00:05:38.860
Don't forget there's no constant just starting from the variables.

93

00:05:38.900  -->  00:05:42.550
Take the odds ratios copy them and put them here.

94

00:05:42.590  -->  00:05:44.260
Not the constant the second line.

95

00:05:44.630  -->  00:05:46.260
And don't forget the name.

96

00:05:46.400  -->  00:05:47.440
Put it over there.

97

00:05:47.480  -->  00:05:48.000
All right great.

98

00:05:48.050  -->  00:05:54.310
So now we can get rid of all this Deely that now we can get rid of all of that.

99

00:05:54.320  -->  00:05:56.310
Delete that.

100

00:05:56.330  -->  00:05:57.420
All of that.

101

00:05:57.500  -->  00:05:58.750
Delete that.

102

00:05:59.120  -->  00:06:02.480
OK so this is us preparing a report.

103

00:06:02.480  -->  00:06:07.550
This is the fun part we're preparing a report for you for the manager or for the executive or whoever

104

00:06:07.550  -->  00:06:14.630
you are presenting to an audience of 10 people you want to explain to them how their bank is performing

105

00:06:14.630  -->  00:06:14.950
.

106

00:06:14.960  -->  00:06:16.370
Why are people leaving.

107

00:06:16.370  -->  00:06:18.740
What has this test done.

108

00:06:18.860  -->  00:06:22.120
What has it told us and what are the steps going forward.

109

00:06:22.130  -->  00:06:23.470
What should the bank focus on.

110

00:06:23.600  -->  00:06:28.670
So obviously there are going to be interest in standon ever or Zed Ballis so we can get rid of them

111

00:06:28.670  -->  00:06:29.240
.

112

00:06:29.300  -->  00:06:35.240
The less information the better people digest the smaller chunks of information better.

113

00:06:35.240  -->  00:06:41.930
You might want to keep the P-value Just as evidence of your approach of you know that these are statistically

114

00:06:41.930  -->  00:06:47.570
significant variables and then maybe you'll have a chat about the 10-Year that it is great and 0.05

115

00:06:47.570  -->  00:06:48.750
but decide to keep it in.

116

00:06:48.770  -->  00:06:54.810
And there is a red flag there that this is you know that it's doing the opposite.

117

00:06:54.830  -->  00:07:00.980
So basically it will just keep them in but we'll grade them out we'll grade them out so people understand

118

00:07:00.980  -->  00:07:04.850
that this is not actually the most important part of the report.

119

00:07:04.850  -->  00:07:07.830
What is important is the coefficient and the odds ratio.

120

00:07:07.940  -->  00:07:13.610
And as you now know the odds ratio is directly linked to the coefficient it is.

121

00:07:13.610  -->  00:07:17.350
X is the exponent of your coefficient you can actually.

122

00:07:17.480  -->  00:07:19.700
We could have done this without the package.

123

00:07:19.700  -->  00:07:27.870
We could have just gone in Excel equals exponent of that right and just copied it down.

124

00:07:28.210  -->  00:07:31.620
And so you can see it's exactly the same value exactly the same value.

125

00:07:31.760  -->  00:07:39.500
So why did it through the packages because other software modeling packages they actually get give you

126

00:07:39.500  -->  00:07:44.210
this call and so I wanted to you know be comfortable with having this call them in here already.

127

00:07:44.330  -->  00:07:45.420
So we have this column.

128

00:07:45.470  -->  00:07:46.300
What can we do if it.

129

00:07:46.310  -->  00:07:50.300
Well let's do the most important part.

130

00:07:50.300  -->  00:07:55.670
We're going to go to home and here we're going to do conditional formatting color scales and was just

131

00:07:55.670  -->  00:07:57.600
like this one right away.

132

00:07:57.620  -->  00:08:03.090
We can see visually see a heat map and we can see what is going on.

133

00:08:03.200  -->  00:08:03.920
We can see right away.

134

00:08:03.920  -->  00:08:05.690
Germany BAMM.

135

00:08:05.810  -->  00:08:12.140
It is the highest impact for people leaning so green in this case is actually actually the reverse heat

136

00:08:12.140  -->  00:08:17.080
map so that's good though we notice that so let's do the reverse heat map so the second one.

137

00:08:17.270  -->  00:08:20.030
So people in Germany are the most likely to live.

138

00:08:20.030  -->  00:08:23.030
So this is all the way this works.

139

00:08:23.030  -->  00:08:31.040
Probably the best way to say it is this is the most important factor most important independent variable

140

00:08:31.040  -->  00:08:33.480
that influences people leaving right.

141

00:08:33.490  -->  00:08:42.700
So if you change from not Germany to Germany then the odds ratio increases by two point one.

142

00:08:42.770  -->  00:08:47.180
Basically the odds ratio doubles then is the next one is gender.

143

00:08:47.180  -->  00:08:52.940
So if when you go from a male customer to a female Kusma all else held constant Melka female customers

144

00:08:52.940  -->  00:09:00.620
onepoint the ratio of a female customer leaving are one point seven times greater than for a male customer

145

00:09:00.620  -->  00:09:00.650
.

146

00:09:00.650  -->  00:09:03.690
So basically the observation created by 70 percent.

147

00:09:03.770  -->  00:09:05.810
That's huge.

148

00:09:05.810  -->  00:09:13.490
And then is active member is the opposite so here you can see it's less than 1 which means that when

149

00:09:13.490  -->  00:09:20.510
you go from an mamm member who is not active member who is active the odds ratio gets multiplied by

150

00:09:20.710  -->  00:09:28.210
0.44 So it basically drops by 66 percent which is also a great a great result in terms of retention

151

00:09:28.220  -->  00:09:29.090
keeping the customer.

152

00:09:29.180  -->  00:09:32.740
Then these are yellow and anything below zero point.

153

00:09:32.750  -->  00:09:37.980
So this is actually a good rule of thumb for you here anything below zero point eighty.

154

00:09:38.000  -->  00:09:40.280
Don't include it so it's not.

155

00:09:40.400  -->  00:09:45.170
It's not that important doesn't have that much of an impact anything above anything.

156

00:09:45.210  -->  00:09:51.620
O has her anything above zero point eight and below 1.2 doesn't have much of an impact so you can kind

157

00:09:51.620  -->  00:09:57.290
of ignore those variables so the odds ratio here changes just multiply by 0.19 age.

158

00:09:57.290  -->  00:10:03.330
Or here it gets multiplied by 1 point or 7 so not that much of a change if you want to you can explore

159

00:10:03.330  -->  00:10:09.270
this further but what this keep telling you that these are your alarming red flags you gotta you got

160

00:10:09.280  -->  00:10:10.310
to focus on these.

161

00:10:10.340  -->  00:10:17.440
This is important so try to make the members more active and you have to cater to the German market

162

00:10:18.020  -->  00:10:19.250
to female customers.

163

00:10:19.310  -->  00:10:24.020
In the German market something is going on there so that's important part and that is what you're going

164

00:10:24.020  -->  00:10:25.870
to be presenting to your executives.

165

00:10:25.910  -->  00:10:28.100
These are your key findings.

166

00:10:28.100  -->  00:10:33.050
Remember data science is about finding insights from the data.

167

00:10:33.050  -->  00:10:33.930
This is your.

168

00:10:33.940  -->  00:10:35.240
These are your insights.

169

00:10:35.240  -->  00:10:39.640
I don't think I want to show you here is that because these were taken exponents.

170

00:10:39.800  -->  00:10:42.360
You know that each of the power of zero equals one.

171

00:10:42.500  -->  00:10:49.970
So if you have a zero here it'll be exactly 1 here anything below zero here will be a value less than

172

00:10:49.970  -->  00:10:53.200
1 so a negative means less than 1 negative.

173

00:10:53.210  -->  00:10:54.580
Less than 1 negative.

174

00:10:54.590  -->  00:10:56.060
Less than one negative.

175

00:10:56.060  -->  00:10:56.600
Less than 1.

176

00:10:56.600  -->  00:11:03.280
Anything above 0 will be a positive value here so positive and greater than 1.

177

00:11:03.470  -->  00:11:07.840
So anything above zero value above 1 here positive above 1.

178

00:11:08.030  -->  00:11:10.530
These are positive above 1 positive above 1.

179

00:11:10.550  -->  00:11:18.680
So just showing you that there isn't an hour there is an alignment between the sign here and whether

180

00:11:18.680  -->  00:11:23.820
the value is greater than 1 or less than 1 here which is as we expected right.

181

00:11:24.080  -->  00:11:31.070
So now we're going to take this and I've actually got a report prepared here so this is going to go

182

00:11:31.070  -->  00:11:33.220
to your manager or manager.

183

00:11:33.710  -->  00:11:39.840
And I'm going to just increase the size a bit make you make some space zoom out.

184

00:11:40.010  -->  00:11:43.030
Let's copy that and the space that in.

185

00:11:43.040  -->  00:11:45.370
So there's a report.

186

00:11:45.370  -->  00:11:49.430
Maybe whereas view grid lines.

187

00:11:49.430  -->  00:11:49.780
No.

188

00:11:49.790  -->  00:11:50.670
So there you go.

189

00:11:50.670  -->  00:11:55.360
So that is the report that you'll be sending off to your manager and maybe you can add some footnotes

190

00:11:55.370  -->  00:11:56.320
say OK.

191

00:11:56.330  -->  00:12:02.960
These are the insites active members least likely to leave and very very impactful metric.

192

00:12:02.990  -->  00:12:07.810
So we want to try make our members as active as possible get them working with our bank.

193

00:12:08.010  -->  00:12:08.350
Right.

194

00:12:08.360  -->  00:12:14.130
And then there's something going on in this geography with female customers.

195

00:12:14.210  -->  00:12:18.800
Perhaps they are not happy with the products that we're providing or there is a competitor that is targeting

196

00:12:18.800  -->  00:12:20.300
them so we have to do something about it.

197

00:12:20.540  -->  00:12:25.910
And then these ones you would only look at them next so probably this one is the next important one

198

00:12:25.910  -->  00:12:26.210
.

199

00:12:26.240  -->  00:12:31.390
Number of products if people have more products they're less likely to leave as you would expect.

200

00:12:31.400  -->  00:12:38.450
So there you go that's how you analyze the coefficients of a logistic regression and more importantly

201

00:12:38.530  -->  00:12:41.300
a Joe demographic customer segmentation.

202

00:12:41.300  -->  00:12:44.200
I hope this tutorial is useful very insightful.

203

00:12:44.240  -->  00:12:49.590
When I learned this for the first time it was like mind blowing took me a while to get my head around

204

00:12:49.590  -->  00:12:52.910
it and actually understand how to use it.

205

00:12:52.910  -->  00:12:59.660
I kept forgetting how how this odds ratio was derived because there is kind of like there's quite a

206

00:12:59.660  -->  00:13:05.390
lot to remember I understand but can always come back and refresh knowledge if you forget but do also

207

00:13:05.930  -->  00:13:09.280
know that you can use this in your modeling now.

208

00:13:09.350  -->  00:13:11.880
And I hope that this information will help in your work.

209

00:13:11.880  -->  00:13:13.430
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

210

00:13:13.430  -->  00:13:15.100
Until then be analyzing
