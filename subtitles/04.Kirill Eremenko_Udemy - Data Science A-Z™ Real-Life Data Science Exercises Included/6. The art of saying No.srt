1

00:00:00,840  -->  00:00:03,770
The art of saying no this is going to be a fun one.

2

00:00:03,900  -->  00:00:05,120
This is one of my very topic.

3

00:00:05,200  -->  00:00:10,050
So no is your favorite work from now on you know how this movie.

4

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:10,430
Yes.

5

00:00:10,450  -->  00:00:14,200
And as a scientist eventually you will become the No man.

6

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:16,520
And that is why is that.

7

00:00:16,560  -->  00:00:22,890
Well that is because a lot of people will come to you as you get better as people in the organization

8

00:00:23,040  -->  00:00:28,710
talk about you more as you deliver more value and change people's day to day role and make them more

9

00:00:28,710  -->  00:00:29,900
efficient and easier.

10

00:00:29,940  -->  00:00:32,430
People will come to people walk to you.

11

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:33,660
They will want your help.

12

00:00:33,660  -->  00:00:40,520
They will all still beg for you to help them on their projects and you'll just have too much requests

13

00:00:40,520  -->  00:00:44,420
too many requests you won't have the time to fulfill them.

14

00:00:44,820  -->  00:00:46,850
And you got to know how to say no.

15

00:00:47,160  -->  00:00:48,940
Now there's two parts to this.

16

00:00:48,960  -->  00:00:53,100
First one is when Hardage is a project that you want to work on.

17

00:00:53,130  -->  00:00:55,380
And second one is how do you actually say no.

18

00:00:55,410  -->  00:00:57,860
So we get started with the first one.

19

00:00:57,990  -->  00:01:00,520
How do you choose the projects that you are working on.

20

00:01:00,570  -->  00:01:04,280
Some of them might be interesting some of them might be less interesting.

21

00:01:04,410  -->  00:01:10,700
But the ultimate decision criteria for you should be the business value that you drive.

22

00:01:10,950  -->  00:01:17,010
So you have to assess a project based on what will the outcome mean for the business how much value

23

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:19,060
add and will this project deliver.

24

00:01:19,320  -->  00:01:25,490
And compare that across all the options that you have heard in front of you and select the one that

25

00:01:25,500  -->  00:01:27,510
you had the most business.

26

00:01:27,690  -->  00:01:33,090
So don't think about things like Who is your best friend or which of these projects is the most interesting

27

00:01:33,090  -->  00:01:34,270
one to work on.

28

00:01:34,430  -->  00:01:40,260
Ultimately you are doing a service for your business and you want to deliver the most value.

29

00:01:40,270  -->  00:01:41,390
Now how do you measure value.

30

00:01:41,490  -->  00:01:42,470
It's completely up to you.

31

00:01:42,470  -->  00:01:45,610
So it might be in dollar terms in my customer experience.

32

00:01:45,750  -->  00:01:47,840
It might be in efficiency.

33

00:01:47,890  -->  00:01:53,690
Maybe I don't know how you measure value in your particular organization or in your particular situation

34

00:01:54,000  -->  00:01:59,670
but once you've established that find the project will deliver the most value and plus that will be

35

00:01:59,670  -->  00:02:04,770
a great aid for you when you're explaining to other people why you're not taking on their.

36

00:02:04,860  -->  00:02:07,410
Which leads us nice segue to part 2.

37

00:02:07,470  -->  00:02:08,490
How do you say no.

38

00:02:08,610  -->  00:02:12,360
Well first of all you've got to explain to people you've got to set their expectations right away you

39

00:02:12,360  -->  00:02:14,980
don't say yes never say yes right away.

40

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:20,550
Once you have an idea for a project you say I will think about it I'll get back to you within 48 hours

41

00:02:20,550  -->  00:02:21,400
or something like that.

42

00:02:21,540  -->  00:02:26,790
And then you assess them and you explain to people that I will select the project and I'll be working

43

00:02:26,790  -->  00:02:28,000
on.

44

00:02:28,050  -->  00:02:31,300
If you have this autonomy or you have to talk to your manager first.

45

00:02:31,410  -->  00:02:36,900
You will have a say in any case even if you have to talk to your manager and assess what project he'll

46

00:02:36,900  -->  00:02:38,450
take on with them together.

47

00:02:38,520  -->  00:02:41,440
You still have a say in what you'll be working on.

48

00:02:41,550  -->  00:02:46,260
And you've got to explain to people that you will be working on the project that drives the most knowledge

49

00:02:46,260  -->  00:02:46,760
of business.

50

00:02:46,950  -->  00:02:50,550
And of course people understand that they won't understand if you choose the project that's the most

51

00:02:50,550  -->  00:02:55,050
interesting for you or they won't understand the future of the project that is your best friend's idea

52

00:02:55,050  -->  00:02:57,380
or you know your buddies idea.

53

00:02:57,520  -->  00:03:01,040
You got to if you choose the one that drives the most value.

54

00:03:01,170  -->  00:03:07,770
You're able to explain to people that that project drives the most value to the business then they will

55

00:03:07,770  -->  00:03:09,420
understand you'll be on your side.

56

00:03:09,660  -->  00:03:15,750
So that's like one tip on how to say no you've got to explain why you're selecting a different project

57

00:03:15,750  -->  00:03:18,270
and why you'll be working on that and not on their project.

58

00:03:18,540  -->  00:03:25,710
And the other thing like the other idea I like can convey here and something that I do is don't position

59

00:03:25,710  -->  00:03:32,610
yourself from the very start don't position yourself as a data chief like like somebody or the analyst

60

00:03:33,060  -->  00:03:38,050
that just crunches numbers and you know doesn't drive value for business.

61

00:03:38,060  -->  00:03:44,160
Just somebody that basically just sits and crunches numbers don't position yourself that way like that

62

00:03:44,160  -->  00:03:48,660
you will get lots of requests and people will have expectations that you'll perform the position yourself

63

00:03:48,780  -->  00:03:55,500
as a consultant as an advisor as a data science adviser to people so when they come to you even though

64

00:03:55,500  -->  00:04:00,060
that you cannot work on their product and you explain to them that unfortunately I can take up your

65

00:04:00,060  -->  00:04:04,560
project because there are other things that are more important for the business at this stage.

66

00:04:04,650  -->  00:04:07,700
However I believe that what you're doing is very valuable.

67

00:04:07,740  -->  00:04:13,480
And here are some tips on how you can use data perhaps assist yourself more.

68

00:04:13,500  -->  00:04:19,050
You know like self-help give them some ideas for self-help in terms of the I've done this lots of times

69

00:04:19,050  -->  00:04:22,980
and this is much better than telling people no and giving an empty hand.

70

00:04:22,980  -->  00:04:27,840
Give them like do something do a bit of research spend half an hour research what they're asking for

71

00:04:27,840  -->  00:04:34,230
maybe or find some online hacks that have already been created that will help them maybe you'll find

72

00:04:34,500  -->  00:04:36,670
a tool that you can guide them.

73

00:04:36,690  -->  00:04:39,470
Tell them about and will guide them in the right direction.

74

00:04:39,510  -->  00:04:44,580
Maybe this work has really been done in the business and they don't have to reinvent the wheel and you

75

00:04:44,580  -->  00:04:46,080
can also direct them that way.

76

00:04:46,080  -->  00:04:53,190
So give them some level of advice so that from there they will perceive you rather than as a person

77

00:04:53,190  -->  00:04:58,770
who says yes or no they'll perceive you as a person who might say yes if they like it or if he can take

78

00:04:58,770  -->  00:05:04,410
up the project we'll give some valuable feedback valuable insights valuable you know dot advice and

79

00:05:04,410  -->  00:05:09,300
plus will benefit you as well in the long run because you will get exposure to different parts of your

80

00:05:09,300  -->  00:05:14,640
business even if the products you will know how it works you'll know intrinsically what does exist and

81

00:05:14,640  -->  00:05:19,430
how you can combine it together to actually deliver value when the time comes.

82

00:05:19,620  -->  00:05:23,300
So that's my advice to you on how to say no and how to pick your product
