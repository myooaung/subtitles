00:00:01.320  -->  00:00:06.840
We've come a long way in creating our customer demographic segmentation model and in fact the backwards

2

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:13.230
elimination process has already been completed and we have this output which is a model with some variables

3

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:19.380
and some values that we're comfortable with and by now you're probably asking well what is there else

4

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:20.590
that we can do.

5

00:00:21.030  -->  00:00:27.300
Well actually there are a couple of things and one of them we will explore today and that thing is transformation

6

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:28.990
of independent variables.

7

00:00:29.500  -->  00:00:30.570
And what does that imply.

8

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:38.310
Well there is a assumption or suggestion that perhaps the independent variables they might not be the

9

00:00:38.310  -->  00:00:47.010
best fit or they might not be the best representation of the facts that they are describing in the rule

10

00:00:47.010  -->  00:00:52.620
format that they're presented to us so perhaps we can do something with these variables in order for

11

00:00:52.620  -->  00:00:59.040
them to represent the effects even better and therefore make our model even better.

12

00:00:59.040  -->  00:01:02.880
And there's a couple of transformation that you can do and we're not just talking about changing the

13

00:01:02.880  -->  00:01:03.260
scale.

14

00:01:03.260  -->  00:01:07.540
That's not a transformation that we're all interested in right now.

15

00:01:07.740  -->  00:01:11.360
We're talking about very significant transformations.

16

00:01:11.400  -->  00:01:13.950
And here are a couple of them that you will be working with.

17

00:01:14.010  -->  00:01:20.220
If you get very you start doing modeling quite a lot you work working these falling transformations

18

00:01:20.240  -->  00:01:20.700
.

19

00:01:21.150  -->  00:01:27.600
So number one or one of them is the square root of your independent variable and you can apply this

20

00:01:27.600  -->  00:01:35.490
transformation of course when your independent variable is 0 or greater number two or another one is

21

00:01:35.790  -->  00:01:41.800
when you apply power to depend verbal like squaring it or taking the cube or your independent variable

22

00:01:41.800  -->  00:01:42.040
.

23

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:46.710
And number three is taking the logarithm of your independent variable.

24

00:01:46.710  -->  00:01:49.010
And once again here you can take longer.

25

00:01:49.010  -->  00:01:52.150
When you depend a variable is greater than zero.

26

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:56.560
And these are the most common transformations that you will be applying to your daughter.

27

00:01:56.820  -->  00:02:01.590
And I can give you a framework that will work in every scenario because ultimately your transformation

28

00:02:01.590  -->  00:02:08.850
will depend on your data your intrinsic knowledge of the business what kind of variables you are working

29

00:02:08.850  -->  00:02:08.990
with.

30

00:02:09.000  -->  00:02:10.850
And many things like that.

31

00:02:10.950  -->  00:02:13.130
So a lot of it is actually trial and error.

32

00:02:13.130  -->  00:02:18.580
So while you're creating your model you input a variable in one form and then you put in another form

33

00:02:18.600  -->  00:02:20.220
an and and then another four.

34

00:02:20.220  -->  00:02:26.670
So you kind of you have some ideas as to which form the variable will work best in and then you try

35

00:02:26.670  -->  00:02:30.020
them out and you see if that improves your model or not.

36

00:02:30.030  -->  00:02:37.110
However what I can do is I can give you one specific example that I've used and a lot of data scientists

37

00:02:37.260  -->  00:02:39.430
use quite often.

38

00:02:39.630  -->  00:02:45.050
And that's that way will have something to look at and understand how transformation actually work.

39

00:02:45.120  -->  00:02:49.860
And moreover you'll be able to take this away and apply it in your work in the future so kind of as

40

00:02:49.860  -->  00:02:52.200
a starting point something that you'll right away.

41

00:02:52.300  -->  00:02:53.620
No.

42

00:02:53.850  -->  00:02:57.800
Why this transformation might need to take place.

43

00:02:58.050  -->  00:02:59.070
So let's get started.

44

00:02:59.070  -->  00:03:04.490
The one we'll be looking at is the logarithm which closes presentation.

45

00:03:04.650  -->  00:03:13.680
And in fact we're going to be taking a logarithm of balance and I will explain why we will be why this

46

00:03:13.680  -->  00:03:15.810
is necessary after we do it.

47

00:03:15.810  -->  00:03:21.150
So first we'll create the transformation will apply to our model and then we'll talk about why I think

48

00:03:21.150  -->  00:03:24.570
this is a good idea to take a longer with more balance.

49

00:03:24.600  -->  00:03:30.330
So let's go ahead and do that in order to create a transformation Grettel right click in your working

50

00:03:30.330  -->  00:03:34.340
space and select define new variable here.

51

00:03:34.380  -->  00:03:40.590
We're going to type in first the name of the numerable So it's going to be log underscore balance and

52

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:43.550
then all put an equal sign and say the formula.

53

00:03:43.590  -->  00:03:44.700
The formulas are going to be log.

54

00:03:44.700  -->  00:03:54.480
So small small case Al then 10 because we want a logarithm of a base of 10 and then we will say balance

55

00:03:55.960  -->  00:03:59.520
what we consciously would like that because we know we have zero balances in our data.

56

00:03:59.550  -->  00:04:05.240
So we're going to add a 1 and a lot of my colleagues here will critique me for adding a 1 to the balance

57

00:04:05.250  -->  00:04:08.170
because it's kind of an arbitrary thing to do.

58

00:04:08.190  -->  00:04:10.160
There are other approaches.

59

00:04:10.230  -->  00:04:14.580
Another approach would be to split your balance variable into two.

60

00:04:14.610  -->  00:04:21.360
And when ever balance is equal to zero then you'll have a flag kind of a dummy variable that will signify

61

00:04:21.360  -->  00:04:26.230
that and whenever a balance is non-zero you'll take a log 10 of just balance.

62

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:28.560
I find that's a more complex approach.

63

00:04:28.560  -->  00:04:35.040
I think that for us it will be sufficient to undertake this approach and more and moreover I believe

64

00:04:35.040  -->  00:04:38.640
that this approach is completely valid when you're building Mollet models.

65

00:04:38.700  -->  00:04:44.550
You totally find to use this approach in order not to overcomplicate things and you will still you should

66

00:04:44.640  -->  00:04:49.370
still get very good results just as you would with other methods.

67

00:04:49.380  -->  00:04:50.670
So we're going to look OK.

68

00:04:50.940  -->  00:04:56.640
And that will create a variable over here and now what do you want to do is you want to replace our

69

00:04:56.640  -->  00:04:59.850
balance bearable with this new variable.

70

00:05:00.360  -->  00:05:07.020
And I say replace because ultimately we shouldn't keep both of them in since that can lead to effects

71

00:05:07.380  -->  00:05:13.740
of multicollinearity and that can break our model basically will have code correlated variables and

72

00:05:13.830  -->  00:05:16.800
variables in there and that's not not a good thing to have.

73

00:05:16.800  -->  00:05:21.540
So we're just going to take a look balance and I'll put it in instead of balance and now will just here

74

00:05:21.540  -->  00:05:22.700
on this model.

75

00:05:22.920  -->  00:05:30.330
And now let's put them side by side and compare So what you will notice here is that balance.

76

00:05:30.630  -->  00:05:33.300
It had a very small profession about two.

77

00:05:33.360  -->  00:05:35.140
Ten to the power of one to six.

78

00:05:35.160  -->  00:05:40.040
Now Lobello has a good coefficients about zero point zero six.

79

00:05:40.140  -->  00:05:45.410
So we could have easily corrected this problem by changing the scale of balance.

80

00:05:45.420  -->  00:05:48.330
But what we did we actually transformed the variable.

81

00:05:48.690  -->  00:05:55.050
And let's see how that impacted our model in terms of adjusted our squared.

82

00:05:55.110  -->  00:06:01.960
You can see that here it's 1 5 1 1 9 7 here is 1 5 1 0 0 6 so it actually went down a bit.

83

00:06:02.160  -->  00:06:04.700
Meaning this model is a bit of a worse fit.

84

00:06:04.950  -->  00:06:10.320
And at the same time you can also see that the accuracy went up a little bit but once again accuracy

85

00:06:10.320  -->  00:06:11.820
is not the defining factor for us.

86

00:06:11.820  -->  00:06:20.820
We do see that the R-squared has dropped a bit and Nevertheless I prefer to keep the balance as a log

87

00:06:20.820  -->  00:06:24.090
balance and you don't always see that our square drops.

88

00:06:24.120  -->  00:06:27.960
Sometimes this will be a great transformation will actually increase R-squared But let's have a look

89

00:06:27.960  -->  00:06:34.770
at why I think that LOEG balance is better to have as a variable than just balance.

90

00:06:34.890  -->  00:06:37.950
I'll bring up another slide to explain this.

91

00:06:38.040  -->  00:06:43.170
Start off with let's look at the wrong balance variable and it's measured in thousands of dollars.

92

00:06:43.410  -->  00:06:50.210
Then and one unit increase in balance means a thousand dollars on top of the existing balance.

93

00:06:50.220  -->  00:06:51.660
So let's look at two scenarios.

94

00:06:51.660  -->  00:06:58.150
Scenario 1 when you balance that we want to understand what the effect of a one year increase is for

95

00:06:58.260  -->  00:07:00.260
a thousand dollar account.

96

00:07:00.450  -->  00:07:07.250
In that case a thousand dollar count goes to 2000 $2000 accounts or basically doubles in Scenario Two

97

00:07:07.620  -->  00:07:13.460
we want to understand what the effect of a 1 unit increase is for somebody who has $10000 in their account

98

00:07:13.470  -->  00:07:13.890
.

99

00:07:14.010  -->  00:07:17.410
In that case the Congress from $10000 to $11000.

100

00:07:17.410  -->  00:07:23.250
So it's nowhere near doubling it's only a 10 percent increase and the greater your balance is your starting

101

00:07:23.250  -->  00:07:25.380
balance is the less significant.

102

00:07:25.380  -->  00:07:27.110
Will that 1 unit increase be.

103

00:07:27.120  -->  00:07:28.430
And that is the key point.

104

00:07:28.590  -->  00:07:33.710
So now let's look at the logarithm of balance luggers and balance.

105

00:07:34.170  -->  00:07:39.680
If there's a 1 unit increase in this transformed variable then what that means for the actual variable

106

00:07:39.700  -->  00:07:42.680
is that it increases 10 times.

107

00:07:42.690  -->  00:07:46.100
So in scenario 1 you're starting down was a thousand.

108

00:07:46.140  -->  00:07:54.300
Your new balance after a 1 unit increase is $10000 is our to your starting balance was $10000 and now

109

00:07:54.360  -->  00:07:58.980
your new balance after one year and increase is $100000.

110

00:07:58.980  -->  00:08:04.260
The second approach here which is ungreen has a much more consistent effect than the first approach

111

00:08:04.260  -->  00:08:05.230
which is in red.

112

00:08:05.280  -->  00:08:05.720
Why.

113

00:08:05.760  -->  00:08:11.850
Well because in the first approach and read as your starting balance is the balance that you're looking

114

00:08:11.850  -->  00:08:17.910
at or the person that you're trying to segment as his balance gets greater and greater and greater than

115

00:08:18.120  -->  00:08:25.650
the effect of a one unit increase becomes less and less and less noticeable and therefore we can say

116

00:08:25.650  -->  00:08:32.880
we can't equally Sigmond somebody who has a balance under $10000 and somebody who has a balance of one

117

00:08:32.880  -->  00:08:38.410
million dollars because for them this one huge increase will mean absolutely different things whereas

118

00:08:38.410  -->  00:08:46.440
the approach in green it has the same effect on any time to any person regardless of their starting

119

00:08:46.440  -->  00:08:46.800
balance.

120

00:08:46.800  -->  00:08:55.090
It's always a 10 times increase so a 1 unit increase has a consistent increase in the balance variable

121

00:08:55.170  -->  00:09:01.620
which is 10 times so whether your balance is 1000 those 10000 or whether it's $10000 it goes to $100000

122

00:09:01.620  -->  00:09:01.830
.

123

00:09:01.830  -->  00:09:08.150
So regardless of who we're segmenting we can say that the effect of a one unit increase in the new transformed

124

00:09:08.150  -->  00:09:14.850
variable is consistent throughout our population and that is much more powerful because that allows

125

00:09:14.850  -->  00:09:18.720
you doesn't restrict your logistic regression.

126

00:09:18.720  -->  00:09:22.470
It doesn't actually it doesn't just focus on one part of your segment.

127

00:09:22.470  -->  00:09:29.730
It can be applied across all of your population or all of the observations that you have equally and

128

00:09:29.730  -->  00:09:36.420
that's why personally I believe that when it comes to balances especially when it's bounces of people

129

00:09:36.420  -->  00:09:38.910
and their cancer or their incomes and so on.

130

00:09:39.180  -->  00:09:46.110
It is a good idea to at least experiment and see what will happen if you transform your balance or that

131

00:09:46.230  -->  00:09:52.490
montri variable into a logarithm of that variable.

132

00:09:52.500  -->  00:09:55.410
So that's our basic transformation.

133

00:09:55.500  -->  00:09:57.370
Once again that's just one example.

134

00:09:57.390  -->  00:10:03.900
Through your science career you will get to work with many more but do keep this one in mind and it

135

00:10:03.900  -->  00:10:08.040
will always be a good starting point for you when you're investigating transformations.
