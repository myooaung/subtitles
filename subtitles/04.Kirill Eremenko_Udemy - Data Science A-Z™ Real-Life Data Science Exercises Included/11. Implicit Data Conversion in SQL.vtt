00:00:00.930  -->  00:00:06.200
Type conversion in school now there are two types of type conversion as well.

2

00:00:06.510  -->  00:00:12.450
The first one is implicit and the second one is explicit explicit can be achieved through two methods

3

00:00:12.450  -->  00:00:12.620
.

4

00:00:12.780  -->  00:00:17.740
Method number one is using the cost function and method number two is using the convert function.

5

00:00:17.940  -->  00:00:22.380
Well we'll talk about cost and convert in the next tutorials of this section.

6

00:00:22.380  -->  00:00:25.510
And today we'll look at the implicit type conversion.

7

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:31.660
Now it is difficult to give an implicit type of conversion because we don't have tables.

8

00:00:31.680  -->  00:00:38.790
Right now we have defined types so I will say that we will have implicit upconversion will heavily rely

9

00:00:38.790  -->  00:00:40.930
upon it in the next section of the course.

10

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:47.430
And when we get there I will put up this star like this in the tutorial in the video of the turtle so

11

00:00:47.430  -->  00:00:53.100
when you see that then remember that you we've already spoken about implicit type conversion and it

12

00:00:53.100  -->  00:00:59.970
was in this tutorial so when you see that star refer back to this tutorial if you need to refresh on

13

00:00:59.970  -->  00:01:01.530
implicit type conversion.

14

00:01:01.710  -->  00:01:08.820
And for now what I'll say is implicit conversion is when Dadda is converted automatically by a skill

15

00:01:08.850  -->  00:01:15.630
when you don't have to specify exactly how the data should be converted when a skill can understand

16

00:01:15.630  -->  00:01:21.000
based on where the data is coming from and where it's going to how that data should be converted and

17

00:01:21.000  -->  00:01:24.580
into what type and there is actually a great table.

18

00:01:24.870  -->  00:01:26.830
So I'll bring that up now.

19

00:01:27.150  -->  00:01:28.100
There it is.

20

00:01:28.140  -->  00:01:29.840
I will attach this to this tutorial.

21

00:01:29.850  -->  00:01:31.600
You can download it.

22

00:01:31.620  -->  00:01:33.180
It's a PDA file.

23

00:01:33.180  -->  00:01:42.870
It basically tells you what you can convert implicitly and what you can convert implicitly here in gray

24

00:01:43.200  -->  00:01:49.260
in this table are marks those types that can convert from one to another implicitly.

25

00:01:49.290  -->  00:01:52.500
So here you've got the types where the data is coming from.

26

00:01:52.500  -->  00:01:56.340
And here are the types where the data is going to and in red.

27

00:01:56.340  -->  00:02:03.330
I've highlighted the role which is responsible for var char so because all of our royal data files are

28

00:02:04.200  -->  00:02:06.310
stored as text so they're in Bartsch are.

29

00:02:06.420  -->  00:02:12.600
This is the only role that we actually need here so let's zoom in a bit and you will see so if char

30

00:02:12.600  -->  00:02:15.700
cannot go into Beanery binary x.

31

00:02:15.780  -->  00:02:17.220
Implicitly it has to.

32

00:02:17.250  -->  00:02:20.690
You have to state an explicit explicit conversion.

33

00:02:20.790  -->  00:02:27.600
It can't go to var binary but we don't really mind because we don't want using it be using these two

34

00:02:27.600  -->  00:02:28.110
types.

35

00:02:28.110  -->  00:02:33.420
And also timestamp Lavarch Arcano into timestep we won't be using timestamps either the ones that we

36

00:02:33.420  -->  00:02:36.330
will be using our VAR char.

37

00:02:36.450  -->  00:02:38.120
So basically have our turn to our.

38

00:02:38.160  -->  00:02:40.320
Makes no sense as why it's empty here.

39

00:02:40.320  -->  00:02:44.820
So what else will we using date time maybe date will be using Date.

40

00:02:44.820  -->  00:02:53.430
You can have an implicit conversion here float where you can have an implicit conversion here.

41

00:02:53.790  -->  00:02:57.000
You can have an implicit conversion here and that's pretty much it.

42

00:02:57.000  -->  00:03:01.390
That's all the types we'll be using So all of them are possible.

43

00:03:01.390  -->  00:03:08.130
The implicit conversion is possible as long as the destination where the data is going is set up correctly

44

00:03:08.160  -->  00:03:12.700
and also your daughter itself in the text is formatted well.

45

00:03:12.720  -->  00:03:17.640
We'll talk more about this in the next section when we do get to implicit conversion and when you see

46

00:03:17.640  -->  00:03:21.070
that star which I talked about in the tutorial.

47

00:03:21.360  -->  00:03:27.060
But for now that's it maybe download this file just in case so you can refer back to when you need it

48

00:03:27.060  -->  00:03:27.330
.

49

00:03:27.360  -->  00:03:32.820
But basically what it's saying is var char can be implicitly converted to the data types that we'll

50

00:03:32.820  -->  00:03:35.020
be working with in this course.
