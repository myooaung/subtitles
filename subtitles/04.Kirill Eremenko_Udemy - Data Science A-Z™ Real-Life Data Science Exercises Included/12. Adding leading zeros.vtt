00:00:00.900  -->  00:00:06.830
Great now we have both a working table prepared here they are a work office supplies customer list and

2

00:00:06.850  -->  00:00:08.930
work office supplies transactional data.

3

00:00:09.180  -->  00:00:13.700
Let's open both of them up customer list transactional data.

4

00:00:13.740  -->  00:00:17.700
Let's pull the transactional data to the right like that.

5

00:00:17.880  -->  00:00:24.300
And today I wanted to talk about something that we briefly noticed in the previous tutorial.

6

00:00:24.420  -->  00:00:33.840
So I will try put these files closer together so we can zoom in a bit here what you can see is the thing

7

00:00:33.840  -->  00:00:42.270
that we noticed is that customer ID here has a random number of characters here a customer id always

8

00:00:42.270  -->  00:00:43.900
has seven characters.

9

00:00:44.010  -->  00:00:51.480
So Can You Spot The Difference like what happened that changed in this file or that this prison in this

10

00:00:51.480  -->  00:00:53.850
file in this table that's not present in this table.

11

00:00:54.090  -->  00:01:00.060
Why these are the same customers ultimately but why do they have more numbers here and less numbers

12

00:01:00.060  -->  00:01:00.440
here.

13

00:01:00.600  -->  00:01:06.110
Well the answer is that because the leading zeros were lost in this table somehow.

14

00:01:06.240  -->  00:01:09.770
So here you've got 673 here you've got six out of three.

15

00:01:09.770  -->  00:01:12.640
But here is preceded by four leading zeros.

16

00:01:12.690  -->  00:01:20.190
So here here anything any leading zeros were lost and that happened that didn't happen in our Because

17

00:01:20.190  -->  00:01:21.360
of what we did.

18

00:01:21.360  -->  00:01:25.490
It happened in the rafaÅ‚ and you can always revert back to the RAW file to check that.

19

00:01:25.490  -->  00:01:28.760
So you just go back to customer.

20

00:01:28.770  -->  00:01:31.880
So in this case what does this file customer list.

21

00:01:31.910  -->  00:01:34.160
Raw customer lists you quickly check OK.

22

00:01:34.170  -->  00:01:35.310
No leading zeros.

23

00:01:35.330  -->  00:01:40.950
You can also go back to the CATV file to the original and check there no leading 0 so the person that

24

00:01:40.950  -->  00:01:45.510
supplied you the file when extracted the data lost the leading zero.

25

00:01:45.510  -->  00:01:51.640
And this happens often happens a lot and I bet it has even happened to you in Excel.

26

00:01:51.810  -->  00:01:57.300
You know when you're doing a view look up and you can do a look up because one column has leading zeros

27

00:01:57.300  -->  00:01:59.520
another one doesn't and you have to fix it up.

28

00:01:59.520  -->  00:02:00.380
Same thing here.

29

00:02:00.390  -->  00:02:06.350
We've got to fix it but we're not going to leave it until the time when we do need to collect the files

30

00:02:06.360  -->  00:02:11.240
because here we can obviously see that this is the only column that is common between the two files

31

00:02:11.250  -->  00:02:13.670
and we will be connecting on this specific call.

32

00:02:13.950  -->  00:02:21.960
So we want to make sure that all files are structured like are structured in the same way and these

33

00:02:21.960  -->  00:02:25.060
columns both either have or don't have leading zeros.

34

00:02:25.140  -->  00:02:30.010
So I suggest putting the leading zeros back and I will show you how to do that today.

35

00:02:30.060  -->  00:02:38.670
And in fact we're going to incorporate it into our proc for this file for the office supplies customer

36

00:02:38.670  -->  00:02:39.030
list.

37

00:02:39.030  -->  00:02:41.550
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

38

00:02:41.760  -->  00:02:43.680
So I'm going to where am I going to do.

39

00:02:43.680  -->  00:02:51.070
I'm going to click here and I'm going to open a customer list proc modify.

40

00:02:51.480  -->  00:02:58.230
And here if I scroll down to the bottom when I'm inserting into the file so this doesn't change the

41

00:02:58.230  -->  00:02:58.950
create table.

42

00:02:58.950  -->  00:02:59.640
That's good.

43

00:02:59.640  -->  00:03:00.940
I created a table.

44

00:03:01.050  -->  00:03:05.860
I do have enough space for the zeros that's great here.

45

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:08.140
I'm inserting into that table also good.

46

00:03:08.160  -->  00:03:09.320
This part has to change.

47

00:03:09.320  -->  00:03:12.460
So by the way you can just highlight and see what you're selecting.

48

00:03:12.490  -->  00:03:19.270
If I execute this part you can see that I'm selecting customer the city's zipcode gender age and I'm

49

00:03:19.290  -->  00:03:21.390
inserting that into that table.

50

00:03:21.450  -->  00:03:25.780
Here you can see that there is no leading zeros and obviously that's the way they're going to be answered

51

00:03:25.810  -->  00:03:25.990
.

52

00:03:26.160  -->  00:03:30.870
So we're going to correct that in this select statement and then we'll test it like this.

53

00:03:30.870  -->  00:03:33.350
And then we will rerun the insert part.

54

00:03:33.540  -->  00:03:36.000
So let's do that.

55

00:03:36.000  -->  00:03:37.690
It's going to be a great exercise.

56

00:03:37.740  -->  00:03:44.220
Customer ID I just want to add leadings there is this handy trick on how to add leading zero's and I'm

57

00:03:44.220  -->  00:03:45.050
going to show you now.

58

00:03:45.060  -->  00:03:50.700
So if you remember this trick you won't ever have to look it up again anywhere else.

59

00:03:50.700  -->  00:03:52.500
You will always just not do it.

60

00:03:52.500  -->  00:03:55.520
You have to know the way this works.

61

00:03:55.590  -->  00:04:01.520
Let's add as many zeros as we can on the left for instance.

62

00:04:01.680  -->  00:04:07.550
We know that there's supposed to be seven characters in total so let's add seven zeros.

63

00:04:07.650  -->  00:04:13.300
So I'm going to go one two three four five six seven right.

64

00:04:13.320  -->  00:04:15.800
Seven doesn't look like so.

65

00:04:16.300  -->  00:04:20.660
Now that is seven seven zeros Plus customer ID right.

66

00:04:20.670  -->  00:04:26.460
So now if I select this because this is a bar chart and this is a string because I put it in quotation

67

00:04:26.460  -->  00:04:31.530
marks what you're doing with the plus sign is it just adding the two strings is the same as in Excel

68

00:04:31.530  -->  00:04:31.740
.

69

00:04:31.740  -->  00:04:33.200
You'd put an ampersand.

70

00:04:33.480  -->  00:04:35.870
But here we're going to put a plus.

71

00:04:35.910  -->  00:04:42.120
So if you select this now and you execute you see that you know there's too many so there's way too

72

00:04:42.120  -->  00:04:44.430
many characters in the custom ID.

73

00:04:44.460  -->  00:04:45.950
But that's not a problem.

74

00:04:45.950  -->  00:04:48.630
Now this is where the trick happens what are we going to do.

75

00:04:48.630  -->  00:04:52.650
We're going to cut off only seven symbols but we'll start from the right.

76

00:04:52.650  -->  00:04:57.870
So we'll go from the right for every single one of these rows we go we're going to go from the right

77

00:04:57.880  -->  00:04:57.920
.

78

00:04:57.930  -->  00:05:01.650
We're going to count so in symbols and then we'll chop off the rest of the zeros we'll we won't care

79

00:05:01.650  -->  00:05:05.450
about whatever is remaining we'll only take the seven.

80

00:05:05.470  -->  00:05:07.790
Most characters of each of these cells.

81

00:05:08.040  -->  00:05:12.960
And that way regardless of how many originally you had in this column of fathers are you going to have

82

00:05:12.960  -->  00:05:13.590
seven characters.

83

00:05:13.590  -->  00:05:18.250
So the way to do it is to just type in super simple right.

84

00:05:18.750  -->  00:05:22.040
Then you take this in brackets right.

85

00:05:22.400  -->  00:05:27.750
The expression that you want to cut or extract from and then you put a comma or a comma and how many

86

00:05:27.750  -->  00:05:29.400
symbols you want extract seven.

87

00:05:29.400  -->  00:05:33.450
So now if I select this execute voila all done.

88

00:05:33.450  -->  00:05:34.020
So there you go.

89

00:05:34.020  -->  00:05:40.170
Now we have seven characters in each column and they are leading zeroes and starting each row and they're

90

00:05:40.170  -->  00:05:41.160
leading zeros.

91

00:05:41.190  -->  00:05:50.520
That's how easy it is to replace your leading How to it is how to return your leading zeros.

92

00:05:50.550  -->  00:05:56.870
Or you know put really the leading zeros into your column if they got lost.

93

00:05:57.060  -->  00:05:59.730
And this is how we've been testing select execute.

94

00:05:59.730  -->  00:06:06.000
So now all we need to do is insert as you remember if I just do this I will add records into my table

95

00:06:06.000  -->  00:06:07.230
so that does that for fun.

96

00:06:07.230  -->  00:06:13.650
You'll see even though it says 43 in fact now there's going to be a six records in this table.

97

00:06:13.800  -->  00:06:14.870
Just have a look.

98

00:06:15.040  -->  00:06:23.640
So I'm just showing you how dangerous it can be to insert into a table that already has data.

99

00:06:23.640  -->  00:06:29.210
So I clicked a 5 there and you see I've got 43 red cards.

100

00:06:29.250  -->  00:06:31.000
And then it starts again.

101

00:06:31.020  -->  00:06:39.450
So just by doing that one mistake I've inserted an extra number of records and that's why it's always

102

00:06:39.450  -->  00:06:43.420
good to have these checks so I hear you might even have a check like this.

103

00:06:43.560  -->  00:06:47.820
So for you and that's why I put the work table at the top because it's more important you might have

104

00:06:47.820  -->  00:06:48.800
another check.

105

00:06:48.990  -->  00:06:53.940
Select star or select count star.

106

00:06:53.940  -->  00:06:54.210
Right.

107

00:06:54.210  -->  00:06:57.370
So at the end after I've done anything you check all you're like whoa whoa whoa.

108

00:06:57.400  -->  00:07:04.110
The 86 records or if you did this a couple times then you select and you go whoa was it 344.

109

00:07:04.140  -->  00:07:05.110
Something went wrong.

110

00:07:05.310  -->  00:07:08.400
And the way easy way to fix that didn't just go up.

111

00:07:08.400  -->  00:07:13.360
Truncate exit could truncate the table insert into 43 rows so.

112

00:07:13.370  -->  00:07:18.520
Copy that here and select count 43.

113

00:07:18.810  -->  00:07:22.720
And just check your table all done leading zeros are there.

114

00:07:22.800  -->  00:07:28.380
And so that's how you return the leading zeros back where they're supposed to be.
