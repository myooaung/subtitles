00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Let's now get to work by creating our style sheets inside the sidebar.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.085
A new file alongside our index.html,

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.460
which we're going to call the styles.css.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.460
Close this down. We can also link this up in our index inside of our head section.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.145
Create a link with the href of styles.css.

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:26.610
Let's start with the HTML inside of our style sheet.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.940
Inside of here we're going to introduce our font size.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.565
I'm going to set mine to be 10 pixels,

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.310
and also a default on weight,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.920
and I'm going to use 300.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.505
Just before we go ahead and create the rest of our styles for this project,

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:46.250
I'm going to introduce something which may save a bit of time.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.550
Well, this is going to be a plugin called Live Server,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.280
and this is going to save us refreshing the browser each time we make any changes.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.405
We can make changes in our code,

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.390
save the file, and this will instantly update.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.040
This is completely optional.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.170
You don't need to install this plugin,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.465
and if you're using a different text editor,

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.240
you may not have the same one available.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.510
To introduce this, we need to go over to the sidebar.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.370
If you're using a Visual Studio Code,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.020
click on the "Extensions",

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.405
and then use the Search at the very top.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:20.590
We give a search for the Live Server,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.930
and then inside here you may have multiple options.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.960
The one I'm currently using is this one just here,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.300
and then you will need to install and enable.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.630
Once this is enabled, you should see a button down at the bottom which says Go Live.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.840
You can then click on this to start the Live Server,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.690
and this will then open this up inside the browser.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.190
If you don't see this icon at the very bottom, you can go to View,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.070
Command Palette, and then do a search for

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.905
Live Server where we'll have the options to open this up with our Live Server.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.510
This is completely optional and you can

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.124
continue with the same way we've been using previously.

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:02.780
But now if we go into our next [inaudible] ,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.585
which is the body,

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:07.955
I'm going to set some properties inside here.

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:12.500
Let's set the width of our body to be 90 percent of the viewport.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.590
We can center this with margin zero auto.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.930
Then I'm going to set a background which will be a radial gradient.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.390
We're going to use this to blend between two different colors.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.180
This is going to blend in a circular motion from

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.940
the center right out to the end of the page.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500
The radial gradient is going to take in two values.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.340
The first one, I'm going to use 343e63,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.095
and then separated by a comma the second one is going to be 2a3352.

00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:53.455
Give this a save and we instantly see the changes inside the browser.

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:59.140
After this, let's go for our main section which is the wrapper for all of our game.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.050
We can create a wrapper which is going to set the text alignment to be in the center,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.505
a background-color f8f1e9,

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:17.695
a border which is going to wrap our game on the left,

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:19.705
the bottom, and also the right.

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:24.925
First of all, we need to set the border color and also set this to be a solid line.

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:28.565
We can then set this to go on three different sides.

00:03:28.565 --> 00:03:31.830
Our border is going to be a solid line,

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.070
and our color, which is going to be equal to ef7b54.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.565
If we save this, currently, we see the border is placed on all four sides.

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:46.310
To select this on multiple sides we can use

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.170
the border-width property and

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.760
then enter the width we want the border on four different sides.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.740
The first one is the top.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.600
We want zero on the top,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.475
eight pixels on the right,

00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:00.260
eight pixels on the bottom,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.540
and also for the left too.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.820
Let's make this section a little taller with

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.365
the minimum height of 80 percent of the viewport height.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:16.110
We can also round these borders on the bottom left and right with our border-radius.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.575
The top left on the top right is zero,

00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:21.630
then three rems on the bottom right,

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.000
and also at the bottom-left.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.905
Also, one rem of padding to give it some spacing inside of the section.

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:35.965
The text-color value I'm going to use is going to be 1f2933.

00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:38.750
So this is our main section and now we're going to

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.645
target some of the elements which are nested inside.

00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:46.280
Starting up at the very top of our welcome screen we have this level 2 heading.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.510
Then we can also select our text elements too.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.070
First of all, let's go for our h2.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.220
We can set the font size to be a little larger, so 2.2 rems.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.320
Also, we can create some spacing on the top and bottom.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.885
I'm going to give this quite a bit of spacing on the top and bottom,

00:05:07.885 --> 00:05:10.560
and then zero on the left and right,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.030
then our text which is inside the p elements.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.570
We can also increase the font-size to be 1.8 rems.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.560
Sticking with this welcome screen section,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.830
next up we have this button area which has a class of button-wrapper.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.785
Currently these two buttons are placed side by side,

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:38.770
so we can change this by setting the display type to be flex,

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.900
the flex-direction to be column.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.595
Next, we can target the individual buttons with the button element.

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:50.980
I have to move the default border with none.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.210
We can also set the cursor to be a pointer once you use a hovers over this button.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.725
Then the background-color for our buttons.

00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:03.385
Let's go for a hex value.

00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:07.140
This is going to be a green color with the shade of 83e1d0.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.185
Some padding on the inside of the button of two rems.

00:06:14.185 --> 00:06:18.870
Then we're going to apply some border-radius on the top of our first button,

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.540
and then the bottom of our second button.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.705
This is going to give us this rounded effect we see on the buttons just here.

00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:30.100
For now we'll target the very first button inside of this selector.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.155
We can set the border-radius on the top.

00:06:33.155 --> 00:06:35.684
So one rem on the top-left,

00:06:35.684 --> 00:06:37.680
one rem on the top right,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.510
and then zero on the bottom.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.040
Currently this is going to apply to all of our buttons.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.550
Now we can override this by selecting the last-child.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.385
Last-child is going to target the last of all type of buttons,

00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:56.840
which is inside of this wrapper.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.710
If we had a third button,

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.390
that would target the third button,

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.935
if we had a fourth button,

00:07:01.935 --> 00:07:04.455
that would target the fourth one, and so on.

00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:06.305
We only have our two buttons,

00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:11.120
so last child is going to apply to this hard button just here.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.204
We can override the background,

00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:18.745
and I'm going to make use of the same red color which we have for this border.

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:23.480
We'll also use the same red color for our range slider during the game too.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.845
This means we're now using a same color multiple times.

00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:31.070
We could go ahead and include the same color,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.650
but we can also use something which is called CSS

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.150
variables also known as custom properties.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.350
Just like when using JavaScript,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.575
we can use CSS custom properties to create

00:07:42.575 --> 00:07:46.705
a variable and use this multiple times inside of all file.

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:49.580
The way we can do this, if we go to the very top,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.130
I'm going to create a section which is going to contain all of our variables.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.985
The first thing which I'm going to do is to target the root.

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:04.190
This is going to allow us to create our variables which we can use across our whole page.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.565
The way we create a variable inside of CSS is by using the double dashes.

00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:12.650
We then use a variable name such as green,

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.795
and then we can select our value.

00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:20.195
The green value which we are currently using is this one just here for our buttons.

00:08:20.195 --> 00:08:23.660
We can copy this, paste this in,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.980
and add a semicolon.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.720
We can also declare our red color,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.280
which we are going to reuse,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.080
which has a value of ef7b54.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.130
Next, we can also set the color for our background, so dash,

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.080
dash background, and this is going to be the color for all the main section.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.705
The main section, if we scroll down,

00:08:46.705 --> 00:08:48.265
there is one that's just here,

00:08:48.265 --> 00:08:51.940
we can grab this and set this as a variable.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.440
If we wanted to, we could also set the colors for our radial gradients.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:05.360
Let's copy these, gradient-1 and also the gradient-2.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.705
Now we have our variables declared up at the very top.

00:09:13.705 --> 00:09:16.180
How do we now use these in our project?

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.190
We use them in place of our colors,

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.220
so let's remove these first radial-gradient.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.340
We then set these inside of a var function and

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.280
then we declare the name which we gave it just above.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.799
This one was gradient-1,

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:33.385
and then the second value is going to be gradient-2.

00:09:33.385 --> 00:09:36.530
Again, inside of our var function.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.715
Save this, and now our gradient, now being reinstated.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:48.230
Down to the main section, we can replace our background also with our variable.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.890
You border. We also have this stored inside of a variable,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.990
and this one is color red.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.515
It still works fine inside the browser.

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:02.020
Now if we scroll down to our buttons,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.375
we have the green variable,

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:06.895
so dash, dash green.

00:10:06.895 --> 00:10:09.640
The background color for our last-child or

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.400
our second button is going to be the red variable,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.560
which we also set just above.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.740
The border-radius for this is going to be different too.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.570
We can override this with the border-radius by setting the top to be zero and zero,

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.980
and then the bottom right,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.565
and also the bottom left to be equal to 1rem.

00:10:27.565 --> 00:10:30.130
We also have the new game button just here,

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.890
but we'll hide this with JavaScript very soon.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.125
Now down to the game section,

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:36.820
let's go for our level three heading,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.160
which is the text of your guess.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.450
This will also be replaced later on to be a message to the user.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:50.060
All we're going to do for our level three heading is to set the font size to 2rems.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.445
Next we have our number input.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:57.040
This is the only input which we'll have on the screen,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.255
so we don't need to be more specific about selecting the type.

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:06.190
All we're going to do is to set the border to be one pixel.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.775
A solid line, which is going to be light gray.

00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:15.085
We'll make it blend in with the rest of the background by setting this to be transparent.

00:11:15.085 --> 00:11:19.690
Margins give some space in outside of our elements of

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.100
2rems on the top and bottom and then zero on the left and right.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.805
Padding for some internal spacing of 1rem,

00:11:27.805 --> 00:11:29.785
this is the top and bottom,

00:11:29.785 --> 00:11:32.690
and then zero on the left and right.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.950
Your width, 16rems.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.280
Then we can also set the text align to be in the center.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.180
This is going to be the text which the user enters inside of this field.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.885
This will push this into the center of our elements.

00:11:49.885 --> 00:11:52.240
Below this we have our range section,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.135
which is the wrapper, down at the bottom here,

00:11:55.135 --> 00:11:57.685
which contains our three spans.

00:11:57.685 --> 00:12:01.450
We're not going to do a lot with these span elements in the CSS.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.070
We'll leave these until the JavaScript section later on, but for now though,

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:11.480
we can set the range section to have a certain height and also the background color.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:20.080
This was an ID. The display type is going to be the flexbox.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.160
These will appear across the page in a row by default.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.560
The background, to begin,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.570
this will be a full green color.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.645
We can make use of our green variable.

00:12:31.645 --> 00:12:34.855
A height of 50 pixels,

00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:37.600
a padding value of zero,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.075
and then also some margin.

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:44.875
I'm just going to set the margin to be zero on the top and right,

00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:47.110
4rems on the very bottom,

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.760
and zero on the left.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.980
This is just to give us some bottom margin.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.995
It's this basis from the start section just below.

00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:58.510
Next, we're going to make the text of 1-100 a little larger.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.760
This section has the ID,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.590
which is going to be range output.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.000
The font size, 1.6rems,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.225
and this is all we currently need to do for this range section.

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:18.685
We'll do the rest over in our JavaScript.

00:13:18.685 --> 00:13:23.545
Down below this, we have our stats section and this has the class of stats.

00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:25.675
This is for our wrapper.

00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:30.025
All we're going to do inside here is to set the text-align to be on the left,

00:13:30.025 --> 00:13:33.235
and then we can take care of our two sections inside.

00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:35.815
Inside of our index or html,

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.995
we gave both of these sections a class of info.

00:13:38.995 --> 00:13:42.309
This is so we can make use of the CSS flexbox,

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:44.335
just like on the final version,

00:13:44.335 --> 00:13:47.365
where we'll place both of these items alongside each other.

00:13:47.365 --> 00:13:52.430
We'll add some spacing in between and make sure these are lined across the page.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:59.590
Our info, the display type of flex.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:04.645
We can then use justify content to add the space between.

00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:08.365
Currently, these are not lined up correctly across the page.

00:14:08.365 --> 00:14:10.600
We see that this is a little higher.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:17.125
To fix this, we'll align our items on the cross axis into the center.

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:23.920
Both this value of zero and also the dash were contained inside of these span elements.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.380
To fix this, we can tag our info section and then any span which is inside.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.230
The font size, we're going to go for 1.6rems.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.560
We're almost done for our styling for this project.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.905
Just before we finish off, let's target this button just here,

00:14:41.905 --> 00:14:45.205
which is going to only appear at the end of the game.

00:14:45.205 --> 00:14:48.740
This has the ID of new game button.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.595
All we're going to do is to reset the border-radius to zero.

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:59.050
Then finally, we can add a media query for the larger sizes.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:06.205
Our media, the minimum screen width of 800 pixels.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:11.860
The only thing I'm going to do here is to restrict the body width when this gets larger.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.320
On the larger screens, I'm just going to set

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.175
the maximum width to be 60 percent of the viewport width,

00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:21.130
just so it doesn't look too overstretched.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:27.200
The body section, we can set the width to be 60vw.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.830
That's it now for our styling.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.245
You can of course change things if you want to.

00:15:32.245 --> 00:15:33.790
Next, we're going to move on to

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:38.930
our JavaScript section and begin to handle the functionality for our game.
