00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.920
Let's now move on to logging the users number of attempts.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.275
Now the reason we're doing this is because we have a

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.410
easy and the hard mode to begin our game.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.650
Once the user reaches either five attempts or 10,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.065
this is how we know the game is over.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.325
We can also log this number of attempts just here too,

00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:22.305
so you can also see how far into the game you are.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:28.575
To do this, let's go and create a variable up at the top of our script call it attempts,

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:31.650
and initially set this to be zero.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.680
After this, we'll then need to increase this value by

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.925
one each time the user has entered something into the input field.

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.715
Down to our compareGuess function,

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:45.150
go to set this just for our if statements.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.965
We need to increment this attempts variable by one each some the user has made a guess.

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:53.570
We can do this with attempts++,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.975
and this will increment the current value by one.

00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:02.885
Currently this is value zero and for each guess it will go to one and then two and so on.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:04.955
We then need to update the DOM,

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:07.370
which is our section just here.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.615
If we go to our index page and then scroll down,

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:15.185
we need to update the span with the ID of attempts.

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:18.360
Let's grab this by the ID

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.065
and then set the inner HTML to be equal to our variable which is attempts.

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:32.340
Okay, let's give this a try, if we go to easy mode to begin,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.690
we have 10 attempts to this,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.470
so we can add any numbers inside here here.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.900
This is increased with each guess.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.590
We will make sure that the player can not go over

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.140
the maximum number of attempts very soon.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.040
But for now though, we're just going to simply update the message to the user.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.515
Inside the else section just here,

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:54.100
this is when they get their guess correct.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.450
We can also add to this section and let

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.375
the user know how many attempts they got it correct in.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:01.910
We can say you got it in,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.250
and then add our attempts variable,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.100
and then also add to the end a string of attempts.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.550
For example, this would say you got it in four attempts and so on.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.340
Let's give this a go, let's try

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.585
the easy setting and see if we can get is correct, so we're too high,

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:29.624
30, 10, 20, 15,

00:02:29.624 --> 00:02:33.650
12, and there we go.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.880
The correct number was 14 and we've got this in eighth attempts.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.235
Good. With this now all working.

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:45.360
Let's now move on to adding our difficulty settings in the next video.
