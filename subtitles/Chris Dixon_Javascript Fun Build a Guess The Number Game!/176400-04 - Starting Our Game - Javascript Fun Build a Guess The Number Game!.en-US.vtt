00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.395
It's now time to add our JavaScript to our project.

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:06.945
Over in our text editor,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:12.975
let's create a new file in the root of our project, called the "script.js".

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.785
We can go over to our index page and link this at the bottom,

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:19.900
just above the closing body tag.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.645
So the script and the source is going to be equal to our "script.js".

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:33.470
The first thing we want to do when the game loads is to generate a random number,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.535
which is between one and 100.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:40.290
We can trigger a function as soon as the browser loads up

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.435
these documents by adding a onload event handler to the body tag.

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:47.540
As soon as the page has loaded,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.840
we can trigger a function and I'm going to call this "init".

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.450
This is effectively initializing our game as soon as the browser loads.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.710
Over to our script.js,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.975
we can now create a variable to store this value inside.

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:05.395
I'm going to call this the "computerGuess".

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:08.209
I've declared this outside of a function,

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.225
so it's available to use in any other function.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:14.180
If we were to declare this inside of a function,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.030
this variable would be scoped to that particular function.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.715
Meaning, we couldn't access it in any other parts of our program.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:24.425
Let's create our function,

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:27.185
which is going to be our init function.

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:29.885
This doesn't take in any parameters.

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:35.545
Then we need to set our computerGuess to be equal to our random number.

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.530
We can do this by selecting the Math.random,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.645
which will select a number between zero and one.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:44.885
We want this to be between one and 100.

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.695
Therefore, we can multiply this by 100.

00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:49.730
This will now leave us with a random number,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.245
which begins with a zero,

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:53.660
all the way through to 99.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.690
However, we want this to be between one and 100,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.015
so we can add up one onto the end.

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:00.935
We also need this to be rounded,

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.475
so we can round this with Math.floor.

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:06.860
Let's put this into place and we can make use of the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.805
Math.floor method and then pass in our number.

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:16.880
This will round down each one of our numbers so we have a number between one and 100.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.590
Let's test if this is working.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:28.210
We can log the computerGuess and this should load up each time the browser begins.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.450
We've got an error. So inits,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.300
we need to make sure this is spelled correctly.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.880
Now, each time we reload the browser,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.375
we get a random number.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:47.450
We can see this inside the console.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.225
This is a good start for our project.

00:02:52.225 --> 00:02:56.315
The next thing we need to do is to show and hide some elements on the screen.

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:58.830
When this page first loads up,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.510
we don't need to see the new game button,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.520
it is just going to be there at the very end of our game. So let's remove this.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.460
Select our document by the ID,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.945
and the ID which we want to select is the "newGameButton",

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.060
which we can see just here.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.440
I'm going to move this by setting the CSS style property of

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.070
display to be equal to a string value of "none".

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.260
So our button is now removed as soon as the game loads

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.740
up and we also want to remove this game area too.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.735
So let's duplicate this.

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:43.730
But this time the ID which we want to select is going to be equal to this game area.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.050
You may be thinking,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.000
why not just hide the game area,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.065
which also includes the button?

00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:52.540
Well, this is because later on in the game once it's finished,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.165
we still need to keep this game area in place,

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:58.100
but we are going to reinstate the button.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.365
The ID which you want to select is the "gameArea",

00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:07.685
which now leaves us with the start screen.

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.150
Good, we've now got a random number.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.980
We're now hiding the game area.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.970
Next, we need to create a function to actually start the game.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.440
This is going to involve hiding this welcome screen.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.285
Then showing the game area which we just removed,

00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:25.180
which will effectively give us two screens.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.110
To do this, we'll create a function and want to call this the "startGameView".

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.305
Once the game has started, we want to remove or hide this area.

00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:40.420
If we go back to our index page,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.735
this area has the ID of "welcomeScreen".

00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:47.915
So document.getElementById.

00:04:47.915 --> 00:04:51.820
We want to select the welcome screen.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.320
Just like a [inaudible] make use of

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.470
the style property of display and set this equal to "none".

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.305
Duplicate this line and the next thing we need to do is to reinstate the game area,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.465
which we've had just above.

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:11.890
So changes to the game area and to make this appear on the screen,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.875
we need to change the display type to be "block".

00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:19.285
Next, we need a way to actually call this function once the game starts.

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:23.860
Well, the way we're going to do this is by using our easy and the hard buttons.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.550
For now, both of these buttons, we're just simply going to call the same function,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.960
but we'll change it later on so the user only has five or 10 attempts.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.200
Let's create our functions.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.410
Our first function is going to be for the easy mode.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.220
Then our second function is going to be for the hard mode.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.920
All these will do is just call our "startGameView" function.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.055
So we can add these into both of these functions.

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:55.840
Now to call these functions,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.835
we do this in our index page.

00:05:57.835 --> 00:06:02.755
Let's go to our buttons and we'll add it on click event handler.

00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:08.810
A function which we want to call once the button has been clicked is easy mode.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.780
The second button is going to trigger the hard mode function.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.550
We should now be able to play this game inside the browser.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.350
Let's click on easy.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.370
This now hides the welcome screen and shows the game area.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.085
Reload this by the hard button.

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:30.020
This also takes us to the game section 2.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.545
Now, we have a way to begin our game.

00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:34.930
In the next video, we're going to move on to capturing

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.680
the user's input and also comparing this with our random number.
