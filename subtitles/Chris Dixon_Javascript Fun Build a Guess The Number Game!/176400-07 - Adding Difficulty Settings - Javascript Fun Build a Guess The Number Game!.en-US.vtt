00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.840
Onto our easy and our hardball buttons.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.240
We are now going to restrict the number of guesses the user can

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.075
make to be either 10 or five.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.480
First of all, let's go up to the top of our script,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.720
and we're going to create a variable to start us in.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.600
I am going to call this the maxGuesses,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
and this is going to be initially not set to any particular value.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.140
It's simply because we want this to be either set to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.445
five or 10 depending on which button the user will press.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:34.170
We can do this one when we start either the easy or the hard mode function.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.340
The easy mode, we're going to set the maximum guesses to be equal to 10,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.830
and then in the hard mode, we'll set this to be five.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.070
Now we have all of the information we need.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.545
We have this attempts variable just here,

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:54.530
which is the number of attempts the player has had.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.745
We also have the maximum variable.

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:59.990
We can now compare these to check if the user can carry on,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.020
or whether the game is over. Let's do this.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.400
Let's go down to our function where I'll put the message to the user.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.320
This is compareGuess, and we only want to go ahead and run

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.260
this section if the number of attempts is less than the maximum number of guesses.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.365
Let's put this all in place,

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:21.545
and we create a new if statement,

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:27.490
which is going to check if the attempts is less than the number of all maxGuesses.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.190
Inside the curly braces,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.665
we can now paste in the section.

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:36.335
This if section will only run if they have not reached the maximum number of guesses.

00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:38.255
If they have reached the maximum,

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:40.735
this is therefore the last attempt.

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:44.715
To handle this, we can create an else section just after this.

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:47.760
This else section is the very last attempt,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.990
so this could be the 10th attempt or the fifth attempt on hard mode.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.785
Even though this is the very last attempt,

00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:58.750
we still want to decide if the players got the number correct or not.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.745
We can do this by grabbing this same section as above,

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:04.135
and we can just alter the messages.

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:07.860
Make sure you grab everything inside of the if section,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.305
so the else, else if,

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:13.665
on the if section. Let's copy this.

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:17.220
Add this into our new else section.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.375
Since this is the last go,

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.635
if the user's guess is too high,

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:24.695
we're going to change this message which is displayed.

00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:27.170
We're going to say you lose.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.965
You can then add a break tag to add this to the next line,

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:33.890
the text of the number was,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.830
then we let the computer guess variable onto

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.830
the end to let the user know what the number was.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.190
We don't need to reset the input box since this is the last guess.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.990
We can also remove this from the else if

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.060
section and then change the message inside of here too.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.955
This else if section is when the user guess is too low,

00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:58.205
meaning they've also lost the game.

00:02:58.205 --> 00:03:01.565
We can grab this exact same message from above,

00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:04.760
and then replace this one just inside of here.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.570
The third condition is when the player has got the correct number,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.010
so we can leave this message as it is.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.235
Let's give this a trial. Let's go for the hard mode to begin.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.200
We have five attempts.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.090
Fifty, too low, 80, too high,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.210
87, 85, and we've lost the game in five attempts.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.880
Reset and go back to the easy mode.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.220
Let's try this out, too high.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.020
Once we get to 10 attempts,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.090
this game is also over too.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.690
This now loses with a fully-functioning easy, and hard mode.
