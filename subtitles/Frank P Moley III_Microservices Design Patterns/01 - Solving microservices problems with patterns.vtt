00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Frank] Microservices architectural styles

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.003
are definitely taking the world by storm,

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.006
and have been for some time.

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.000
As you venture into the world of microservices,

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.006
one thing becomes very clear.

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.009
The problems that you encounter in building,

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.006
converting, and operating microservices,

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.002
are not unique just to you.

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:22.009
As with all software engineering,

10
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.008
we as a collective create design patterns

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.002
so we can fix the problem once,

12
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:32.002
and reuse that pattern every time we encounter it.

13
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.007
Using these patterns save you time and energy,

14
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.009
and allows you to move to your business needs

15
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.008
that after all, most of us find to be

16
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.008
the most interesting part of our jobs anyway.

17
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.008
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

18
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:48.004
I'm a cloud native developer and architect.

19
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.003
I have helped convert large scale enterprise systems

20
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:55.002
into modern distributed cloud native architectures

21
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.007
built with microservices.

22
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.000
I've also helped build large scale,

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.008
globally distributed systems from scratch

24
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:06.002
using microservices architecture patterns.

25
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:10.003
In this course, we will focus on common problems encountered

26
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.000
when building microservices as a whole

27
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.008
and common solutions to those problems.

28
00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:19.003
The goal, ultimately is to arm you

29
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.008
with some basic knowledge with these patterns

30
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.000
so you can make them part of your tool belt.
