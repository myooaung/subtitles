00:00.180 --> 00:01.920
This is a job that we will build.

00:02.310 --> 00:03.630
This is the homepage.

00:03.990 --> 00:07.320
This is the login page and this is the register page.

00:07.710 --> 00:09.900
Let's try to register a user now.

00:10.470 --> 00:11.820
So create this user.

00:11.850 --> 00:15.030
When I submit, I will get redirected to the login page.

00:15.480 --> 00:22.080
Now I have two options when I try to log in, so I will try the first one.

00:25.120 --> 00:32.020
No, it is asking us to put the authenticator code so we will use two factor authentication in this

00:32.020 --> 00:32.470
course.

00:33.880 --> 00:42.160
I scanned it with my phone and now I will put the correct value and know I am logged in.

00:42.970 --> 00:46.640
We will log in via access and refresh tokens.

00:46.660 --> 00:54.190
If I check the application console, we will see here refresh token, which is a step only.

00:54.580 --> 00:59.980
And if I refresh, we will see that we are requesting the user.

00:59.980 --> 01:01.720
We are not getting the first time.

01:01.720 --> 01:08.320
We are using the refresh endpoint to refresh our access token and we are getting the authenticated user.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.670
So we are using also access and refresh tokens.

01:13.540 --> 01:21.760
We can log out and we will log in again, but this time we will log in with our Google account and that's

01:21.760 --> 01:22.060
it.

01:22.060 --> 01:29.080
I'm logged in with my own account, so the name and surname is different and that's it.

01:29.080 --> 01:33.190
We will log in via two factor authentication.

01:33.550 --> 01:40.420
We will logging via our Google account end in case you want to change your password and it also forgot

01:40.570 --> 01:42.010
password functionality.

01:42.010 --> 01:45.760
So I'll change the password of this user that I created.

01:46.450 --> 01:53.500
I'll submit and we will send an email and we will open the software to receive emails.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.080
And as we can see we received an email here.

01:56.860 --> 02:03.490
I'll click this email and I'll click this button to reset our password and we will get redirected to

02:03.490 --> 02:06.310
a new page where we can reset our password.

02:06.850 --> 02:12.610
I will put a one character password and submit and it is successful.

02:12.610 --> 02:21.340
Now when I login with my previous user, I will use this one character password and it is successful.

02:21.610 --> 02:27.340
Not that the second time that you are logging in, we are two factor authentication.

02:27.340 --> 02:32.710
We will not display the QR code because it is already stored in your phone.

02:32.980 --> 02:35.110
So I'll put the correct code here.

02:35.410 --> 02:41.350
643914 and I'm successfully logged in.

02:41.350 --> 02:44.860
So this is the app that we will build.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.760
If you are interested in building this up, consider taking this course.

02:48.940 --> 02:49.390
Thank you.
