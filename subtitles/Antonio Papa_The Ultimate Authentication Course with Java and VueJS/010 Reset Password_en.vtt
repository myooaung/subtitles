WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:05.610
So we successfully completed the forgot component and we actually got the passwords.

00:05.850 --> 00:10.530
And now what is left is to create the component to reset our password.

00:10.530 --> 00:11.670
So let's do it.

00:12.930 --> 00:22.290
We'll create a view component reset and this will be all copy the code from register.

00:24.860 --> 00:32.230
And I will sit here and we will keep only the password and the password config inputs.

00:32.930 --> 00:47.480
This will be please insert your password or please reset your password and let other variables know

00:48.590 --> 00:49.400
all that.

00:49.400 --> 00:49.790
Here.

00:49.910 --> 00:50.450
Set up.

00:54.110 --> 01:04.400
And we will create data is equal to reactive and we will add the password.

01:05.360 --> 01:15.290
Default is zero and the password confirm which is also empty and let's return the data.

01:17.210 --> 01:29.480
So we added the these values we need also to add the function submit which is equal to an empty function.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.510
Let's return the function here submit.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.830
And this is also added.

01:37.850 --> 01:39.860
Let's also console.log here.

01:43.450 --> 01:46.590
And let's add this component to the outer.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.650
So go here, all duplicate this and also this.

01:51.220 --> 01:53.320
And the path will be reset.

01:53.410 --> 02:03.310
But this time we will also add a token here because that is the uh, root is the reset slash and the

02:03.640 --> 02:09.130
token that we will use, the component will be reset.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.310
So that's it.

02:13.800 --> 02:21.710
Now, if we click this link, we will go to the reset page where we can reset our password.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.170
So let's make it work.

02:26.270 --> 02:28.040
Let's import access here.

02:28.070 --> 02:33.290
Let's make this synchronous and let's also import active.

02:37.330 --> 02:44.590
And we will await Axios will post to reset.

02:44.980 --> 02:48.330
And we will send this information.

02:48.340 --> 02:52.720
So first we'll send the response in the buzzard confirm.

02:53.560 --> 03:02.470
But we will send it like this because we need also to send the token from the path here.

03:04.130 --> 03:09.650
So when you need to send password, password confirm and the token will get it from the crowd.

03:10.130 --> 03:11.630
Don't confuse the crowd with the.

03:12.140 --> 03:13.430
There are different things.

03:13.490 --> 03:17.300
So this is equal to use out.

03:19.770 --> 03:23.790
And we need to import it from viewers out there.

03:24.330 --> 03:29.910
And the road is for the parameters in our URL.

03:30.630 --> 03:37.170
The token will be equal to road that params.

03:38.830 --> 03:42.290
That token like this.

03:43.270 --> 03:44.770
And that should be it.

03:44.860 --> 03:51.760
So we will send you the new password in the password confirmation along with the token which is in our

03:51.760 --> 03:52.270
Ural.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.060
And then we will reset our password.

03:55.450 --> 03:58.540
In the end, we will then direct to login.

03:58.750 --> 04:06.460
So to redirect we have to use the rather which is equal to use or alter.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.040
So these are different functions.

04:11.070 --> 04:18.150
One is used for the URL params and the second one is used to redirect to different pages.

04:18.160 --> 04:27.990
So we will wait around the bush to log in and that should be it.

04:28.350 --> 04:31.110
Now let's try to reset our password.

04:31.380 --> 04:32.740
Old type of the new password.

04:32.760 --> 04:33.810
One, two, three, four.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.890
One, two, three, four.

04:35.460 --> 04:36.060
Submit.

04:37.260 --> 04:40.490
And we got redirected to the login page.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.970
So this means that we successfully changed the password.

04:44.980 --> 04:50.400
So let's throw it out be it b dot com and if we use a password beep.

04:51.980 --> 04:56.600
We will not redirect to the home because that was the old path.

04:56.600 --> 05:02.480
Or if we put one, two, three, four, then we will redirect and we successfully logged in.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.090
So the password is changed.

05:05.420 --> 05:08.780
So this was how to reset passwords.
