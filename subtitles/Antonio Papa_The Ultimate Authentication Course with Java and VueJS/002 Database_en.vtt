WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:02.100
We have the application ready or not.

00:02.110 --> 00:03.720
Ed, it's time to start working.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.020
We're going to start by model.

00:06.450 --> 00:13.410
We're going to build the database structure that we need to support the indication of all users.

00:14.100 --> 00:21.660
We are going to use a feature of Spring GDC that allows us to create from the Java code the database

00:21.660 --> 00:31.770
structure that we want to do that going to these resources folder here in source main resources.

00:32.140 --> 00:33.690
I'm going to create a new file.

00:34.020 --> 00:37.760
This file will be called Schema Dot Haskell.

00:39.690 --> 00:42.030
This name, this fine, lame.

00:44.020 --> 00:52.720
He's going to it's going to be detected by spring and it's going to be executed when we launch the application

00:52.720 --> 00:56.410
and create the schema that's that we want and that we need.

00:57.620 --> 00:57.880
Okay.

00:58.120 --> 01:01.210
So to start, I'm going to create the user table.

01:01.850 --> 01:05.650
Create table, if not exists.

01:08.120 --> 01:08.540
User.

01:12.210 --> 01:13.900
And he's stable with an I.D..

01:15.620 --> 01:16.790
Of type identity.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.720
And in this case, not.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.020
No.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.700
It's going to have first name.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.450
This will be a string.

01:30.510 --> 01:37.830
So in school terms, he's a worker of, say, 255.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.930
Also not know it's going to have a last name.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.990
Also a strong so worker 255.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.560
Also not know all of these files are mandatory.

01:57.880 --> 01:58.740
You have an email?

02:01.640 --> 02:03.200
Our car to 55.

02:03.710 --> 02:05.450
Also not know.

02:09.020 --> 02:13.250
And buzzwords that are going to use to lock in.

02:14.810 --> 02:17.510
Worker 255 Also.

02:18.540 --> 02:18.770
Not?

02:18.780 --> 02:18.990
No.

02:25.120 --> 02:25.930
So it's a bit.

02:27.340 --> 02:28.080
Too much forward.

02:28.090 --> 02:30.040
So let's fix the indent.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.840
Going to use four spaces in then.

02:33.860 --> 02:36.980
So one, two, three, four, five, six.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.530
That's correct.

02:41.530 --> 02:41.700
It.

02:56.890 --> 02:57.730
So like this.

03:07.030 --> 03:10.600
Now that the table definition is finished and missing.

03:12.210 --> 03:22.380
Yes, we can go to our application properties file and we need to define the properties that we're going

03:22.380 --> 03:23.940
to use to.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.140
Connects to the database.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.060
I'm going to launch presentation mode to make it more visible.

03:31.600 --> 03:38.770
So first property that I'm going to define is called Spring Data Source URL.

03:39.160 --> 03:39.420
Okay.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.960
And this is the link to our database.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.510
Doesn't matter which database it is.

03:46.510 --> 03:52.060
If it's my school, if it's a school server, if it's H2, we have to set up the URL to our database.

03:53.230 --> 03:57.340
In this case I will use the one for my database.

03:57.340 --> 04:02.260
So gdb c h2 file and locational file.

04:02.260 --> 04:03.490
I will be finding it as well.

04:03.880 --> 04:08.320
It's going to be it's going to be called of db to be on the root folder.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.780
And this is specific to H2.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.100
I would add some connection properties.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.810
They depend from vendor to vendor, but they also belong here in this property.

04:18.830 --> 04:21.920
In my case, I'm going to use to be close on exit.

04:23.660 --> 04:24.060
False.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.340
This is that database is persistent.

04:27.350 --> 04:32.090
If I run the application multiple times, auto reconnect.

04:34.390 --> 04:36.970
It's going to be true if there is an issue.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.880
It will connect again.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.620
And then these last one.

04:42.600 --> 04:47.580
Now two server equals to this is to.

04:49.070 --> 04:50.030
Facilitate.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.430
Capital letters out server.

04:53.030 --> 04:56.360
This is to facilitate using the database.

04:56.780 --> 04:58.530
In this case, it.

04:58.770 --> 05:05.450
It means that, uh, if I'm connecting to the database to, uh, in order to, to see the contents of

05:05.450 --> 05:09.890
the database where the application is running, I will not have any, any issue.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.230
The other property that you're going to need spring.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.760
Spring dot data source.

05:20.260 --> 05:23.560
Driver class name in this case is the driver name that we use.

05:23.650 --> 05:25.510
These guys are not H2 driver.

05:27.340 --> 05:32.890
Spring data source is the name we're going to use fourth and spring at the source password.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.870
We are also going to use all.

05:37.310 --> 05:42.140
Next, we are going to define two properties still related with school.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.610
So spring has school in IT mode.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.090
We are going to be fine always.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.350
This property tells spring to always run the schema.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.520
That Haskell file.

05:53.700 --> 05:54.030
Okay.

05:55.910 --> 05:57.050
And the other one?

05:57.890 --> 05:59.350
Spring squirrel.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.310
You need a platform.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.500
It's going to be H2O as well.

06:05.780 --> 06:09.830
Finally not related with the database, but we are already doing it.

06:10.430 --> 06:15.470
I'm going to define server port 8000 instead of 88.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.370
Just personal choice.

06:19.850 --> 06:27.330
If it's production environment in a lot of situation, these port 80, it's by default is 8080.

06:27.350 --> 06:34.400
But uh, depends on, on the application use case we are defining on weed value 8000.

06:36.510 --> 06:37.230
And the other one.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.400
Server error include message.

06:40.410 --> 06:41.550
I'm going to say always.

06:43.650 --> 06:48.840
Recently spring would changed the way they handle errors and the message with the description of the

06:48.840 --> 06:50.100
error is no longer displayed.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.370
In this case, I want it to be displayed.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.670
We are going to define some custom message and I want it to be displayed.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.250
So I add this here as well.

07:03.210 --> 07:05.760
So now the application is here.

07:06.450 --> 07:10.230
I'm going to copy the connection string.

07:10.830 --> 07:11.130
Okay.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.680
You can choose any tool to connect to the database.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.630
I'm going to use two built in from Intel.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.060
You can also use the beaver.

07:20.510 --> 07:27.230
So I'm going to choose H2 at the base, going to paste the URL.

07:29.580 --> 07:34.770
And in this case, I don't need this, uh, dip close on exit force.

07:36.120 --> 07:36.600
I can.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.350
I can leave it.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.610
No worries.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.620
Uh, and you're going to use author and author for this to.

07:46.820 --> 07:48.080
And I can click.

07:48.530 --> 07:48.890
Okay.

07:50.410 --> 07:51.370
This will return an error.

07:54.070 --> 07:56.890
Databases are not created yet, but he will create.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.390
So I received the warning that the two files were created now.

08:02.590 --> 08:07.050
In this case they were created when I connected with the database two.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.240
But if I launched the application, they will also be generated.

08:11.260 --> 08:14.440
So to show it, I will delete.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.470
I will launch my application.

08:28.420 --> 08:33.520
And in a little bit the files would be detected by the.

08:35.610 --> 08:40.110
By and large, they will be there now if we connect.

08:41.330 --> 08:41.630
Here.

08:42.760 --> 08:49.960
So if I refresh this also DB tables, I have here my user table.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.460
And they can open a table and see the contents.

08:56.470 --> 09:01.030
For the moment we don't have anything, but the table is already created.

09:07.290 --> 09:09.210
We'll close this.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.690
You as that's.

09:13.860 --> 09:14.340
You know.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.160
Stop the application.

09:19.120 --> 09:24.940
One last thing that I will do is that I will add files to to get.

09:26.020 --> 09:27.100
So in this case.

09:28.390 --> 09:33.820
I was go to get and as file it's not mandatory.

09:34.150 --> 09:38.890
But usually when you're working you should use some kind of versioning.

09:39.220 --> 09:43.450
I'm using it, which means that at every step I will commit to changes they do.

09:43.780 --> 09:49.180
This makes it easier, especially when following courses like this, because if you have a mistake and

09:49.180 --> 09:58.150
you need to go back, you can just right click go to get and do rollback and you rollback to the place

09:58.150 --> 10:00.750
that you were in the beginning of the studio of Lessons.

10:00.750 --> 10:07.870
So I always recommend to do the same and commit the messages as we go.

10:08.860 --> 10:12.030
In this case, I don't want this file.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.530
I click it out of this file to show.

10:14.530 --> 10:22.310
I don't want this file to be added to it because my database contains the data, so I'm going to take

10:22.330 --> 10:25.350
it in your file, and that's the exclusion here.

10:27.190 --> 10:28.060
Image file.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.460
They want to ignore.

10:31.930 --> 10:32.380
Health.

10:35.010 --> 10:35.330
Maybe.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.460
So like this.

10:41.060 --> 10:41.730
Uh.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.010
Gaetz Not yet.

10:44.540 --> 10:47.060
So, like, this is just in the getting your file.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.790
So now if I commit.

10:53.790 --> 10:56.400
I will put my comet message.

10:58.140 --> 10:59.040
So in this case.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.560
And at the base.

11:01.950 --> 11:02.370
Ready?

11:04.710 --> 11:07.450
We're going don't want to commit it for.

11:14.610 --> 11:16.360
So I can close my project.

11:16.380 --> 11:18.840
And now I'm ready for the next step.
