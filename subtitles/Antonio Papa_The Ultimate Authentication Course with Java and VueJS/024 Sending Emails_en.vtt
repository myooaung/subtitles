00:00.030 --> 00:06.330
Next step for application is to implement an email service to send emails when you forget or password.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.720
This is what we're going to implement next.

00:10.050 --> 00:12.310
So start by creating a new email service.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.550
New service class here.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.130
I will call it mail service.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.330
I'll create a class.

00:21.350 --> 00:24.530
This is a service class for spring.

00:25.850 --> 00:26.330
Indeed.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.800
I need to add to.

00:27.980 --> 00:28.520
Um.

00:29.420 --> 00:29.930
Attributes.

00:31.040 --> 00:31.460
Private.

00:31.460 --> 00:32.030
Final.

00:32.510 --> 00:32.870
Java.

00:32.870 --> 00:33.050
Mail.

00:33.050 --> 00:33.530
Sender.

00:34.550 --> 00:34.910
Java.

00:34.910 --> 00:35.090
Mel.

00:35.090 --> 00:37.790
Sender and private.

00:38.090 --> 00:39.800
Final string.

00:40.730 --> 00:41.480
Default.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.330
Uh, front end.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.220
I want these two properties.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.330
I will add as constructor parameters here.

00:54.170 --> 01:00.610
And this one as we did for every other configuration before we will use.

01:00.650 --> 01:07.400
Um, we inject from configuration properties so value into be.

01:10.010 --> 01:10.880
No sign.

01:12.830 --> 01:16.670
You see the strings like this implication.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.060
And.

01:23.720 --> 01:28.970
If you gave this application tens.

01:33.170 --> 01:36.610
He faults you?

01:38.100 --> 01:39.590
Okay, I want to call it like this.

01:41.210 --> 01:48.290
So if I zoom out, I starting with my Java emails and my default front end tomorrow.

01:49.790 --> 02:00.410
So in here we need to add the default variable and we are using we starting with we reading list in

02:00.410 --> 02:00.890
this case.

02:01.550 --> 02:11.600
So we see that this property is used here and then we need to look into the methods that that we are

02:11.600 --> 02:21.980
going to need to do to have this email service working, which is also important, and it's very important

02:21.980 --> 02:23.840
and essential for the next step on an application.

02:25.340 --> 02:30.020
So my constructor is here and we'll just need a method.

02:30.800 --> 02:35.540
Public Void Send for growth message.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.220
Message and I will needs an email.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.380
I will need a token.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.700
There will need to be zero.

02:58.500 --> 02:58.710
Okay.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.160
So it can coinbase u.

03:03.170 --> 03:03.470
R l.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.430
So how will this work?

03:09.990 --> 03:12.540
I will take my URL.

03:15.290 --> 03:18.970
If I don't have a basic URL in the method called, I will, uh.

03:19.160 --> 03:19.940
It will be new.

03:20.210 --> 03:20.530
Okay.

03:20.540 --> 03:21.860
So my basic URL.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.650
If it's not?

03:26.740 --> 03:27.130
No,

03:30.070 --> 03:31.810
then it would be zero.

03:33.860 --> 03:37.540
Or else it would be default front on the euro.

03:39.290 --> 03:40.730
Okay, that's my logic.

03:41.030 --> 03:42.950
Then I will send a simple mail message.

03:46.790 --> 04:01.400
New simple my message and I will in the message I will set from so in this case set from I will as an

04:01.400 --> 04:06.980
imaginary email address here like this.

04:10.870 --> 04:11.340
Okay.

04:11.350 --> 04:22.630
So my imaginary email is your message said to me to be the email that I just provided in here.

04:22.690 --> 04:29.920
So the one the one in the argument of the method, I will set the subject.

04:34.210 --> 04:35.020
Subject will be.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.190
Reset your password.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.620
It must be said subject not to get subject.

04:46.730 --> 04:49.250
And finally said text.

04:51.990 --> 04:55.890
Set texts and then we left my text string here.

04:56.990 --> 05:01.680
I will look to be a clickable um h html.

05:02.160 --> 05:08.520
So Kido will do string format and then I will write.

05:12.110 --> 05:12.530
Big.

05:15.000 --> 05:15.600
Here.

05:19.090 --> 05:24.880
To reset, synch your passwords like this.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.540
And then these here it'll be.

05:31.170 --> 05:32.070
It's stress.

05:33.810 --> 05:36.060
He calls backslash.

05:39.140 --> 05:40.490
Percentage as.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.060
Here.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.310
And then here I need.

05:54.380 --> 05:55.260
Too close.

05:57.420 --> 06:00.240
And here I will let you know.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.840
And Stoke and they actually have an error here.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.670
I just put one, but they need two.

06:10.540 --> 06:19.390
So what they want is to send this and then to have reset and then to have my token.

06:19.930 --> 06:20.230
Okay.

06:20.230 --> 06:25.180
And we didn't build yet this and we didn't build this yet.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.830
So it's a bit confusing because you don't know the structure of the endpoint, but basically it would

06:29.830 --> 06:40.390
be a slush API slash reset slash token number and this is what we are going to get in these information.

06:42.190 --> 06:49.060
So Java Mail sender sends email message message.

06:49.060 --> 06:54.520
Okay, sent this and my service should be complete.

06:57.570 --> 07:07.650
Then the only other thing that we have to do is to to change or else service a $0.02 to two, $0.02

07:08.580 --> 07:13.830
to the message when we have to add the forward as well.

07:14.490 --> 07:16.620
So we implemented a forgot here.

07:17.160 --> 07:17.830
We will do.

07:17.850 --> 07:19.830
Forgot forgot email.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.690
I need to to inject it first on top.

07:30.010 --> 07:36.610
So in this case, an email service.

07:38.540 --> 07:39.260
Service.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.320
I need to add it to my constructor.

07:46.210 --> 07:46.940
It's here.

07:48.520 --> 07:54.010
So in my here, I can just do my own service, send for God's message.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.360
So I have my email here.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.420
I have my token here.

07:58.870 --> 08:01.990
And I have my original URL that I had prepared already.

08:05.060 --> 08:06.350
So this should be it.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.500
Now, how can we test this?

08:10.460 --> 08:13.670
We're going to go over email.

08:13.670 --> 08:17.660
Sender is not found.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.130
He's.

08:21.140 --> 08:22.310
What am I missing?

08:38.420 --> 08:38.870
Mm hmm.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.390
And it's configuration properties.

08:41.390 --> 08:41.630
Yes.

08:41.810 --> 08:43.010
I forgot was.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.160
So here we need also.

08:49.340 --> 08:53.420
Server, not server spring.

08:58.070 --> 08:58.700
Spring.

08:58.910 --> 09:07.130
Male Host And I will specify the host as this one and spring.

09:08.480 --> 09:08.990
Male.

09:10.740 --> 09:13.860
Fought to be one 0 to 5.

09:14.940 --> 09:15.630
What is this?

09:15.870 --> 09:17.490
So to test this, I.

09:17.490 --> 09:20.540
I'm going to run a software called Mail Hog, okay?

09:21.090 --> 09:33.840
It's a piece of software that runs and works as an email server where you can you can send emails.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.130
So in this case, I will run it.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.660
I have a path here to go.

09:42.180 --> 09:50.490
And as you can see, there is a SMTP address running in 0.0.0.0 1025.

09:51.630 --> 10:02.190
So this is a configuration that I are hit 0.0.00 1025 and I just go to this to the link.

10:02.610 --> 10:06.060
So I have my inbox, my faking box here.

10:07.590 --> 10:09.360
I received my application runs now.

10:10.860 --> 10:11.010
Okay.

10:11.460 --> 10:12.030
No, he's fine.

10:12.060 --> 10:16.080
So I was able to instantiate only just two arguments were missing.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.380
And then I would send the same forgot.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.550
And we will see that first of all, in the database.

10:23.550 --> 10:25.440
We will have two attempts.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.860
We had one before and we have one now.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.690
And in my email server, I have one email here.

10:34.620 --> 10:40.410
Sync Reset your click here to reset your password.

10:43.690 --> 10:49.150
So I'll be able to click here and reset the password.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.800
That's that I need.
