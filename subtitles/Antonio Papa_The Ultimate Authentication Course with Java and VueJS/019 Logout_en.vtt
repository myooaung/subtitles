00:00.180 --> 00:03.870
Next step on this course is to implement the logout.

00:04.980 --> 00:05.460
Endpoint.

00:06.930 --> 00:10.470
This one will be very simple to build.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.400
It's a post mapping.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.350
I will call it logout.

00:19.230 --> 00:19.710
Public.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.610
Log out response.

00:25.770 --> 00:26.310
Follow.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.590
Always the same structure.

00:30.750 --> 00:30.840
No.

00:30.900 --> 00:31.770
God response.

00:32.340 --> 00:33.030
Look out.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.060
And we build the methods we need to.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.460
The producer of the record.

00:42.910 --> 00:43.880
Look out.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.460
Response.

00:45.970 --> 00:49.060
In this case, it will be just a string message.

00:52.460 --> 00:55.340
And we need to inject the cookie.

00:58.100 --> 00:58.880
Cookie value.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.170
Refresh Toucan.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.070
String refresh token.

01:14.570 --> 01:20.690
And they are going to need HTP servlet response out.

01:20.690 --> 01:21.980
We log out from the application.

01:22.340 --> 01:28.640
At the moment, the only thing that we have is a cookie that says that that contains my token.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.650
So what we are going to do is to delete the cookie.

01:34.070 --> 01:35.390
It's as simple as that.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.450
How do we delete a cookie java?

01:38.660 --> 01:40.970
That is the complicated part.

01:41.780 --> 01:44.630
So we're going to build a new.

01:46.210 --> 01:48.490
Cookie with the same name.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.010
Okay.

01:51.370 --> 01:54.180
And the same refresh token cookie.

02:00.140 --> 02:00.860
With very new.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.250
Cookie sets max age.

02:13.810 --> 02:14.260
Two zero.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.220
And as before said, it's the only true.

02:24.540 --> 02:25.230
Response.

02:32.410 --> 02:32.770
Okay.

02:33.370 --> 02:33.940
Missing here.

02:33.940 --> 02:34.870
Quick response.

02:34.870 --> 02:35.590
Response.

02:36.930 --> 02:37.510
Cookie.

02:37.530 --> 02:37.950
Cookie.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.930
And in fact, we don't need this.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.510
So just return.

02:51.140 --> 02:53.780
A new, uh, lockout response.

02:59.140 --> 03:01.420
What about response success?

03:07.460 --> 03:08.390
We run the application.

03:10.780 --> 03:12.790
We call the logging user.

03:13.030 --> 03:15.130
So we are logged in and we have a cookie.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.560
We called the log out user.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.490
We have success and we no longer have the cookie.

03:20.500 --> 03:26.740
So if we try to refresh the token, no, we cannot because the refresh token cookie was deleted.

03:28.600 --> 03:33.490
This is how we will implement the log out mechanism for the moment.

03:34.870 --> 03:38.260
It's very simple in nature.

03:38.260 --> 03:45.910
So it's just using again the cookie, creating exactly the same cookie with no value, setting the max

03:46.540 --> 03:57.460
age zero set max age to zero to say that's to have no age and HTP only still true because it was true

03:57.460 --> 03:58.630
in the refresh token as well.

03:58.630 --> 04:01.100
We added to response and we just see success.

04:01.120 --> 04:07.270
So it's very simple in in this case, it's a bit trickier because you don't have a method to delete.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.090
You always need to create a new with no value.

04:10.660 --> 04:13.930
But other than that, it's straightforward to do.
