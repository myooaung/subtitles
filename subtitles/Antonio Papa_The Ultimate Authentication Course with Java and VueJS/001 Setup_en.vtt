00:00.510 --> 00:05.750
It's time to create the View project and we will created using the view your life.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.010

00:14.400 --> 00:16.800
I already did it in my machine.

00:16.890 --> 00:22.950
So now I will open the terminal and I will run, review, create and all.

00:22.950 --> 00:26.370
Call the project view out.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.330
Now we will have some options.

00:30.720 --> 00:41.460
I will manually select the features I want to select TypeScript or outer in the view X and I'll go further

00:41.490 --> 00:42.900
or select the version three.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.760
Oh, the type.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.510
No, here.

00:47.710 --> 00:56.830
Then all the other values I will select the default value and now our project is being created.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.390
Let's wait till it's completed.

00:59.500 --> 01:03.850
So the project was created and I will open it with my idea.

01:04.330 --> 01:10.390
So now over there and PM and serve so we can see it on the browser.

01:11.950 --> 01:15.310
It will serve on localhost port 8880.

01:17.590 --> 01:21.490
Or copy this URL and the old open it on the browser.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.890
We can see this is our view up.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.140
No, let's make some changes.

01:26.260 --> 01:36.460
So it will go to the source directory and I will remove the boat and home view old remove also the hello

01:36.460 --> 01:39.370
world here I'll go to the router.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.740
All the removal are out here

01:44.530 --> 01:46.780
in the in the store.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.790
I won't change anything old.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.840
Remove the assets.

01:50.880 --> 01:53.040
And in awe of that view.

01:53.040 --> 01:57.300
I will remove all the styles here and all the email here.

01:58.260 --> 01:59.310
We need some.

01:59.310 --> 02:00.840
Is the mill here also?

02:01.320 --> 02:03.330
So I will go to bootstrap.

02:03.930 --> 02:10.890
Go to get bootstrap dot com click get started and copy the thesis link here.

02:11.670 --> 02:14.190
Go to public index.

02:14.190 --> 02:19.020
That is the email here and paste the bootstrap link.

02:20.610 --> 02:24.990
So we out of the bootstrap link, we still need to order the template.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.010
So go to examples and we will go to the signing template here.

02:31.170 --> 02:40.920
Let's view the P source and copy this each the email, the main div here and let's go to our update

02:40.920 --> 02:42.840
view and all pasted here.

02:44.690 --> 02:47.150
A note or up will look like this.

02:47.180 --> 02:49.070
Still, we need to make some changes.

02:50.060 --> 02:51.980
First, we'll remove the image.

02:52.220 --> 02:55.160
This is police training, so everything is correct.

02:55.880 --> 03:00.980
Old removal for this remember me button in this paragraph in the end.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.880
And I'll keep this simple.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.790
Still, we need some other stuff.

03:08.300 --> 03:13.490
So if we see here we are referencing assigning the thesis file.

03:14.120 --> 03:14.750
Click here.

03:15.350 --> 03:17.720
And we need also these styles here.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.080
But I won't copy all of them.

03:20.090 --> 03:27.320
I'll copy just the form signing styles and all of them in the end.

03:27.380 --> 03:32.960
So a lot here style and old paste with styles.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.430
All save them.

03:35.060 --> 03:38.600
And we can see now the please signing form.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.860
And it looks correct.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.490
Now in the next tutorial, let's add more forms.
