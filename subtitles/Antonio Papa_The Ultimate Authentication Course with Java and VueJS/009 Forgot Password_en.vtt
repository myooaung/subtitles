00:00.150 --> 00:02.430
Now it's time to reset our passwords.

00:02.460 --> 00:04.160
So I open the mail hook here.

00:04.170 --> 00:10.560
So we are listening from emails from the back end and the first change that we will do is to wait here

00:10.860 --> 00:14.100
and link to point to the forgot component.

00:14.520 --> 00:26.670
So let's go to the login and here I will add a div with a class of margin bottom three margin top three.

00:27.690 --> 00:40.080
And the link will be a router link to forgot and the here old safe forgot password.

00:40.740 --> 00:41.550
Question mark.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.710
And that should be it.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.310
So I guess it should be merging both on three.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.830
So that is the case.

00:50.430 --> 00:54.360
So we added the link, but we need to add also the component.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.850
Now let's create another view component.

00:57.780 --> 00:58.380
Forgot.

01:00.270 --> 01:03.780
And this component will be similar to the log in.

01:04.350 --> 01:06.270
Old copy the template here.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.230
I'll go to the forgot and I'll change this to submit.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.910
Please insert.

01:18.060 --> 01:29.070
Your passport, your email three here and this will be just an email field and all four will remove

01:29.070 --> 01:30.750
this forgot password link.

01:32.070 --> 01:35.700
And let's add the now the variables.

01:35.850 --> 01:37.260
Let's all set up here.

01:40.220 --> 01:48.830
And we will create only an email here which I will use it with the ref function.

01:48.830 --> 01:57.950
So we need to import ref from view and we have to return the email and we do don't need the data now

01:57.950 --> 02:00.800
we can simply use the email.

02:01.550 --> 02:04.340
Then we need to add the submit function.

02:04.340 --> 02:06.170
So let's add the submit function.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.460
Let's return it here.

02:15.090 --> 02:19.770
And we will use it here and that's it.

02:19.800 --> 02:25.590
So let's add the console.log here so it doesn't throw in there.

02:25.590 --> 02:30.630
And let's see the forgot component we need to audit also in the router.

02:31.140 --> 02:36.480
So this is forgot and the component is.

02:38.240 --> 02:38.870
Forgot.

02:40.730 --> 02:41.750
Like this.

02:42.740 --> 02:43.910
We are everything.

02:43.940 --> 02:52.910
Now let's click this button and we will go to this page where we require just an email address.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.230
Let's add the class here.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.620
Well, I would love it here.

03:00.490 --> 03:01.990
Margin top three.

03:03.810 --> 03:05.610
So now it looks better.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.940
Now let's send this email to the backend.

03:09.030 --> 03:11.100
So we need to import access.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.850
Let's make this asynchronous.

03:13.860 --> 03:23.340
And here we will await actuals both for let's import also access.

03:24.630 --> 03:30.380
Two forgot, and the data that we will send is the email.

03:30.390 --> 03:40.080
But as we said, the ref here which I forgot to initialize it with empty or needs to be emailed that

03:40.140 --> 03:40.890
value.

03:41.670 --> 03:42.600
So that's it.

03:42.750 --> 03:47.300
This is the request and let's try it out now.

03:47.310 --> 03:52.770
So I'll send an email to be it B dot com.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.670
Let's submit.

03:54.570 --> 03:59.490
And if we see mail hook here, we can see that we successfully got an email.

03:59.910 --> 04:06.600
So we will use this email later on the next tutorial to reset our password.

04:07.050 --> 04:15.000
But still we need to make a change here because we have to get notified or something when we submit

04:15.000 --> 04:19.530
here because we are not sure if we got the email or not.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.290
For that we need to add here first.

04:23.290 --> 04:24.600
So create another variable.

04:25.770 --> 04:27.510
I'll call it notify.

04:29.400 --> 04:38.940
And this notify variable is equal to reactive because it will contain multiple variables inside.

04:39.090 --> 04:42.240
So the first value is class.

04:42.510 --> 04:44.700
So I'll put health.

04:45.630 --> 04:48.150
In the second value is message.

04:49.530 --> 04:52.440
So how will we use this variable?

04:52.910 --> 04:57.960
So when we submit here, all are up this with the three catch.

05:03.350 --> 05:18.080
And in case it is successful, we will set to notify that Glass is equal to success and notify that

05:18.080 --> 05:20.390
the message is equal.

05:21.830 --> 05:24.590
Email was sent.

05:27.490 --> 05:28.780
If I forgot equal here.

05:31.020 --> 05:39.060
And in case we get an error, notify that cloth is equal to danger.

05:40.410 --> 05:46.560
And the notify that message is equal to email.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.380
Does.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.040
Not exists.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.230
And that's it.

05:57.290 --> 06:04.040
Let's return the notify here variable and we will use it here on top.

06:04.520 --> 06:14.280
So after the main div, I will add another div here with a vif.

06:14.330 --> 06:24.480
So if not, if that class is set, then we will set the class like this.

06:24.500 --> 06:30.140
So if we pass the column in front, it means that we can use variables.

06:30.470 --> 06:46.520
So I will use here a string like this and the class will be alert and alert minus the notify that class

06:46.820 --> 06:47.690
like these.

06:47.720 --> 06:51.890
So as you can see, we are constructing our self.

06:52.190 --> 06:57.260
The class and the role will be, uh, alert here.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.310
And that's it.

06:59.090 --> 07:04.430
In the end, we will set the notify message here.

07:06.530 --> 07:10.820
And with this, we will notify every time we submit.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.590
So let's test it.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.260
I'll put the same email now.

07:16.340 --> 07:24.500
And as you can see, we are notified that the email was sent and as we can see, we got another email

07:24.500 --> 07:30.710
here and in case A will stop, no mail hook in case an error happens.

07:31.460 --> 07:41.820
If we submit, we probably there should not be email does not exist but the error occurred but the the

07:41.990 --> 07:49.550
idea is this that we are notifying every time we have an error or a success message.

07:49.880 --> 07:54.410
So in the next tutorial, let's actually reset the password.
