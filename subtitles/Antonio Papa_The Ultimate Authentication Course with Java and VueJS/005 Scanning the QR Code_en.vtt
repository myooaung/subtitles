00:00.520 --> 00:03.730
So now we need to insert the authenticator code.

00:03.730 --> 00:11.890
But before that, if the user hasn't stored the QR code yet, we need to show a QR code here.

00:12.370 --> 00:14.110
So let's do that.

00:14.170 --> 00:24.720
For that, we need to install a package NPM, install QR code and we need to install it as a dev dependency

00:24.730 --> 00:25.330
also.

00:25.840 --> 00:31.360
Let's also install and be installed as a dependency types.

00:33.040 --> 00:37.630
Your code and let's use it.

00:37.630 --> 00:43.420
So when we go to the authenticator form, we will probably have.

00:45.160 --> 00:55.150
This of value OTP of the URL and the if we go the value, then we need to show a QR code.

00:55.570 --> 01:07.180
So let's do it now or create a variable here image which is a reference to an empty string or null.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.370
Also now and I'll return the image here.

01:14.710 --> 01:19.690
And that image will be after the forum here.

01:19.690 --> 01:30.430
So image and the know I will do this I will check if perhaps.

01:31.990 --> 01:35.820
That logging data that the this value which I will copy.

01:38.020 --> 01:38.680
He said.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.400
Then if it is said, then we will do it like this.

01:42.430 --> 01:45.400
QR code lets import your code here.

01:46.150 --> 01:49.900
Import your code from QR code.

01:53.090 --> 01:54.770
Then we will use it here.

01:55.790 --> 01:58.280
Your code to data your URL.

01:58.430 --> 02:02.060
The value is props in data.

02:03.570 --> 02:10.800
OTP both your URL and then will be a function for the function.

02:10.950 --> 02:18.480
The first parameter is an error and the second parameter are the data that will render our cure code.

02:19.380 --> 02:29.600
So now when we get the data, our image that the value will be equal to data.

02:30.690 --> 02:32.960
So I think I made the mistake here.

02:32.970 --> 02:34.230
So what is the problem?

02:36.270 --> 02:36.780
So.

02:37.830 --> 02:39.120
For the image here.

02:40.110 --> 02:54.630
I will use an image with an s r c to the image and probably later the class of width 100.

02:58.140 --> 03:03.530
And we have a problem with that type of this image.

03:03.540 --> 03:05.820
So we should probably add it here.

03:06.570 --> 03:12.040
This is a riff that contains I think it's a string or no.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.570
Like this for sure.

03:15.580 --> 03:22.860
We will not have problems and I will do a vive here if the image is set.

03:24.380 --> 03:25.460
And that's it.

03:25.700 --> 03:26.280
Let's see.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.450
Now, let's log in with this user.

03:29.460 --> 03:33.500
And as you can see, we have a QR code showing here.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.320
Old scan it now with my phone.

03:37.310 --> 03:41.990
So I did scan it now and I'll put now the value from my phone.

03:41.990 --> 03:44.930
So 838994.

03:45.830 --> 03:46.430
Submit.

03:48.250 --> 03:51.130
And it's not working, probably.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.100
Actually, this is successful.

03:58.710 --> 03:59.970
Everything is successful.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.290
I just forgot to redirect.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.560
After we submit successfully.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.850
So let's do that.

04:06.750 --> 04:10.050
We need to wait here when they meet.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.470
And this will be a success case.

04:14.280 --> 04:19.240
So if the form is successful, then we have the props here.

04:19.350 --> 04:26.430
We need to add also here the context, which is a type of set up context.

04:27.420 --> 04:28.920
Don't forget also to import it.

04:29.460 --> 04:34.200
And if it is successful, we will use context here.

04:35.530 --> 04:39.570
Amit, success like this.

04:40.110 --> 04:40.830
But the.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.010
I will not hear the status.

04:45.490 --> 04:47.440
So I'll make the condition.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.690
If the status is 200, then we will admit success.

04:56.020 --> 04:56.780
And that's it?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.110
No, let's use it to our lodging.

04:59.650 --> 05:05.200
And this will omit the event that is successful.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.830
Let's add the function success.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.820
And we will return it here.

05:19.030 --> 05:23.080
And when is successful we will call the success function.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.330
Now this success function.

05:26.370 --> 05:28.420
We will finally use this router.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.980
So we will wait.

05:30.010 --> 05:31.530
So let's make this synchronous.

05:32.900 --> 05:42.860
With active access, not so remote but or outer push to the main beach.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.750
And we also needed to use a little more.

05:47.750 --> 06:00.110
We don't all feel the store is equal to use store because if it is successful we will also await store

06:00.680 --> 06:04.670
dispatch set of two.

06:04.670 --> 06:10.610
True, because we will be authenticated and that should be it.

06:10.910 --> 06:13.280
So let's try it out again.

06:13.280 --> 06:25.460
Now a dot com eight and this time we want see a QR code because when we scanned it at our phone and

06:25.460 --> 06:30.410
when we successfully logged in, we will not show a QR code again.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.110
We have store it in our phone.

06:34.040 --> 06:45.260
Now the QR code is 155530 submit and I successfully redirected and I'm logged in now.

06:45.590 --> 06:47.900
So this is how it works.

06:48.020 --> 06:52.640
This is how we logging using two factor authentication.
