00:00.390 --> 00:07.470
Now that we have our model created, we need to create or repository to interact with that model and

00:07.470 --> 00:09.390
to interact with the database.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.610
I'm going to create a new file here.

00:12.710 --> 00:13.220
Called.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.330
User repo.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.760
And it's going to be an interface.

00:21.270 --> 00:22.770
I'm going to add it to it.

00:26.370 --> 00:32.400
So the first thing I'm going to do is to annotate this class with repository.

00:32.850 --> 00:42.420
These two let's string know that these are a special class that is handles the communication with the

00:42.620 --> 00:53.790
database and it's going to extends crude repository and this crude repository to lambda users.

00:54.690 --> 00:56.910
It will be indexed by along.

00:58.440 --> 01:06.910
What I'm saying here is that this is the main entity that the group repository will return and probably

01:07.260 --> 01:09.540
the primary key of user is the long.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.030
We define it here as the long.

01:12.450 --> 01:16.320
That's why we put long there.

01:17.850 --> 01:24.750
And as far as the repository is, um, is concerned, it's.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.300
Pretty much.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.330
It's the only other thing that we have to do.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.290
In Spring.

01:33.510 --> 01:39.420
Uh, in my ELF application in the main class that we have from the beginning, I am going to ask the

01:39.420 --> 01:42.180
invitation enable JDK repositories.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.240
This is only because we are using GBC.

01:49.680 --> 01:54.240
So because we are using GDC, we need to ask this invitation here.

01:54.930 --> 01:56.370
Then I will run my application.

01:58.900 --> 01:59.860
And everything works.

02:00.820 --> 02:04.840
So I can commit the changes and go to the next step.
