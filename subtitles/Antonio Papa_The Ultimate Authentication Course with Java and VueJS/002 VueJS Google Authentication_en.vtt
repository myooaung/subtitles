WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:03.990
No, we will add the Google authentication in the frontend.

00:04.140 --> 00:06.600
So let's start by adding a button here.

00:07.290 --> 00:10.860
Let's go to the login form and we will add a new button.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.320
I'll make it an anchor link.

00:15.330 --> 00:21.300
Log in with Google and each of you will be.

00:23.050 --> 00:23.860
JavaScript.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.580
Avoid zero.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.540
So when we click the button, nothing will happen.

00:32.290 --> 00:33.880
And let's add some classes.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.360
So this will be a class button.

00:38.410 --> 00:43.390
Button outline danger.

00:44.810 --> 00:51.380
Text Center margin top three and width 100.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.210
So the button will look like these.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.460
And when we click, nothing will happen.

00:59.210 --> 01:02.300
So let's add the authentication part now.

01:02.690 --> 01:05.360
So first we need to install a package.

01:05.450 --> 01:12.740
So let's install a package called NPM, install v3 google.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.030
Oh.

01:16.080 --> 01:16.910
And the.

01:18.140 --> 01:21.380
Not sure if this has type, but the.

01:22.760 --> 01:23.690
Let me try it.

01:23.720 --> 01:31.730
AMPM installed is a div dependency types view three Google Oath.

01:33.570 --> 01:35.360
And let's go to our main that.

01:35.380 --> 01:35.780
Yes.

01:35.790 --> 01:41.460
So it does not have that type dependency here.

01:41.730 --> 01:43.920
We will add the variable.

01:43.950 --> 01:46.350
So first, let's import geode.

01:48.430 --> 01:48.820
From.

01:49.870 --> 01:50.560
View three.

01:51.990 --> 01:52.500
Google.

01:55.140 --> 02:03.810
Now there is a problem with this which we need to suppress this warning with, uh, deus ignore.

02:04.830 --> 02:10.110
But this will also cause another problem because I think in our Yes.

02:10.110 --> 02:16.740
Linked, uh, also this ignore is also a problem.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.370
So we have to suppress this again.

02:19.380 --> 02:22.380
So a lot of suppressing here.

02:23.020 --> 02:28.470
Uh, just to import to this package, which has not the type cube version.

02:29.190 --> 02:33.630
So you can either add these comments or you can change, change your is linked.

02:33.750 --> 02:39.510
I will use just this comment in the now, uh, let's create a variable.

02:40.110 --> 02:44.250
Growth is equal to growth.

02:46.220 --> 02:51.140
Create g of like this.

02:52.310 --> 02:56.300
And inside we need to add only one thing which is our client.

02:57.880 --> 02:58.360
Idea.

03:00.160 --> 03:07.990
And we can get that client ID if we go to our Google Cloud, click our app and this is the client ideal.

03:07.990 --> 03:08.590
Copy this.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.390
Your URL here.

03:12.110 --> 03:13.880
And the opposite here.

03:14.540 --> 03:16.880
So what is the client idea?

03:17.390 --> 03:18.740
In the end, we will use.

03:20.610 --> 03:21.740
Visigoth.

03:23.910 --> 03:24.990
So we added it here.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.870
Now let's go to our locator form and the here we need to import import the same thing.

03:30.870 --> 03:38.400
So we need to import this part along with the comments and I'll pass it here.

03:39.990 --> 03:43.760
So we have the import and now all create a variable g.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.180
All is equal to lower growth.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.520
You've g.

03:51.450 --> 03:51.770
O.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.780
So it is like this.

03:57.650 --> 04:00.830
And for the moment, let's console.log this value.

04:01.470 --> 04:01.990
Joe.

04:04.690 --> 04:10.390
And when we inspect, hear and see, the console will see growth here.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.520
And we have a lot of functions.

04:13.090 --> 04:17.790
What we need is this signing when we click this button.

04:17.800 --> 04:22.120
So let's do it now let's add the non click here.

04:24.400 --> 04:31.450
Click and the create the function here Google Earth.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.720
Let's return to Google Earth.

04:39.880 --> 04:46.780
And when we click, we will call the Google Earth function inside the Google Earth function.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.880
We will call this a geode.

04:51.590 --> 04:56.660
And will get the Google user is equal to g of.

04:59.290 --> 04:59.500
In.

05:03.490 --> 05:05.350
I think I made some mistakes.

05:05.350 --> 05:10.480
So this should be a synchronous and this list should be weighed here.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.180
And signing is with capital I.

05:14.560 --> 05:19.390
And in the end I will console.log to the Google user.

05:19.930 --> 05:20.950
So let's try this.

05:22.220 --> 05:22.580
Click.

05:23.180 --> 05:24.290
Log in with Google.

05:25.620 --> 05:28.770
And as we can see, it's supporting our account.

05:29.040 --> 05:38.250
And when I click one of my accounts, this is the result will get this response.

05:38.730 --> 05:43.920
And what do I need in this response is just this I token.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.410
So that is the only thing that I need.

05:46.770 --> 05:52.110
So let's send that that value to the backend and let's complete the authentication.

05:52.110 --> 06:03.120
So we will get a response here or I will get it directly like this, status and data are equal to it.

06:04.660 --> 06:16.780
Actually we will post to the PIC and Google Authentication and we will send only one token which we

06:16.780 --> 06:19.230
get it from Google user.

06:20.270 --> 06:20.880
W.

06:21.320 --> 06:21.710
C.

06:23.170 --> 06:33.610
I.D. an escort token four with a value year wac i d underscore token and of course this is a logging

06:33.610 --> 06:43.330
so we need to add with credentials to through as well because we will get the access and refresh token

06:43.870 --> 06:44.110
soon.

06:44.150 --> 06:48.340
So it is a logging we need to use also this part.

06:51.990 --> 07:00.010
Because we will get the the access token, which we need to use it to our headers and the status.

07:00.030 --> 07:08.610
We need it because if it is successful, if the status is 200 actually old, copy this code as well.

07:11.040 --> 07:15.330
If thought of is 200, we will admit success.

07:15.330 --> 07:24.180
So we need to add the new immediate success and the let's go to our log in so.

07:25.550 --> 07:33.180
Now looking for will have also the successor function here, which I will copy and paste it here.

07:34.250 --> 07:38.840
So uh, in the log in form, we can log in via Google.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.050
That's why we omitted success in the authenticator form.

07:42.320 --> 07:48.860
If we put the authenticate and authenticate their value, then we omit success and that should be it.

07:49.280 --> 07:57.200
Let's try now to login with my Google account or select my user and it is successful.

07:57.350 --> 08:01.640
As you can see, this is my name on Google and now it's appearing.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.630
Look out here and everything is working as it should.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.880
Also, we got a refresh token.

08:08.630 --> 08:09.680
Uh, it seems so.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.340
We got old for more information regarding Google, but we want to use that.

08:13.340 --> 08:17.270
We will use the refresh token and the access token.

08:19.550 --> 08:22.310
That we get from our beckoned.

08:22.700 --> 08:23.480
So that's it.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.190
This is how we log in via Google.

08:26.210 --> 08:29.030
And this was also our course.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.350
Thank you for watching.

08:30.380 --> 08:31.330
Until now.

08:31.340 --> 08:34.070
And let me know if you have anything.

08:34.100 --> 08:34.550
Thank you.
