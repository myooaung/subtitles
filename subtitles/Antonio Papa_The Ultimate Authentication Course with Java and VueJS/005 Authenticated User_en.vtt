00:00.530 --> 00:03.010
So we got the axis refresh token.

00:03.020 --> 00:06.020
Now let's get the authenticated user.

00:06.020 --> 00:13.160
Let's go to the home and let's adhere to a setup in the here.

00:13.430 --> 00:20.870
Let's create a message which this message will be displayed here in the helo.

00:21.770 --> 00:25.130
And instead of reactive, we will use ref.

00:26.450 --> 00:29.540
So let's import the ref from view.

00:30.080 --> 00:37.280
And the difference between reactive and ref is that the ref can be used on one variable and reactive

00:37.280 --> 00:39.560
can be used on multiple variables.

00:40.490 --> 00:52.220
So the message well, the default message here is you are not logged in and I will return this message.

00:54.380 --> 00:57.230
In the end, I will display it here.

01:00.130 --> 01:06.250
And if we sit here, uh, I forgot, uh, to add another one.

01:06.250 --> 01:09.640
So double, double curly braces.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.050
And it's saying you are not logged in.

01:14.740 --> 01:20.100
Uh, but when we get the authenticated user, this message should change.

01:20.110 --> 01:25.660
And for that, we need to send the request to the back in together authenticated user.

01:26.050 --> 01:27.970
But we won't do it directly here.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.880
We need another function which is on mounted.

01:31.720 --> 01:37.330
So when this component has mounted, let's import on mounted also from view.

01:39.160 --> 01:45.100
We need to call the back and uh, this is in a synchronous function.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.570
And here we will call active.

01:48.580 --> 01:53.380
So we'll get the response is equal to it.

01:53.860 --> 01:54.580
Axis.

01:56.390 --> 02:08.270
Import taxes that get its p localhost port it thousands less API slash user and we don't need anything

02:08.300 --> 02:16.850
else because we will send the bird token directly in the header and that's it.

02:17.030 --> 02:22.460
In the end we will change the message and the message.

02:23.270 --> 02:32.150
It won't be like this message is equal to new message because when we use the ref we have to use message

02:32.150 --> 02:36.020
that value if we want to change the value here.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.600
So that is the difference.

02:38.600 --> 02:45.500
And now the message that value is equal to response, that the data is the user.

02:45.520 --> 02:55.340
So what I will do right now is this all deconstruct the response and I want directly the data here in

02:55.340 --> 02:57.860
the message that value will be equal to.

02:59.330 --> 02:59.780
Hi.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.410
Data.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.210
That first name here.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.860
Another space in the data.

03:08.950 --> 03:10.900
That last name.

03:12.590 --> 03:20.930
So with this we will get to the authenticated user, but still we are not authenticated as we can see.

03:21.410 --> 03:22.610
Why is that happening?

03:22.790 --> 03:30.350
Because probably the token expired, so we have to log in again and we can see.

03:30.360 --> 03:30.710
Hi.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.930
So it's working.

03:33.950 --> 03:41.540
We are getting the authenticated user, but still as we can see, in 30 seconds this will expire.

03:41.540 --> 03:44.450
And if I refresh, we are not logged in.

03:45.230 --> 03:50.330
To prevent that, we have to use the refresh token in the next tutorial.
