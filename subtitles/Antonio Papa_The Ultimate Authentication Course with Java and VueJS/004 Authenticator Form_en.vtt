00:00.390 --> 00:08.560
So we got the information from the logging firm and now we want to create the authenticator for them.

00:08.580 --> 00:09.510
So let's do it.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.490
Authenticator.

00:13.850 --> 00:17.120
Form and the form will be similar.

00:17.210 --> 00:19.340
I will copy it from forgot.

00:21.290 --> 00:24.710
And place it in the authenticator form.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.800
We don't need these classes in the.

00:29.090 --> 00:31.160
We need just an input here.

00:34.020 --> 00:35.370
Please insert.

00:38.820 --> 00:40.740
Your health indicator

00:43.440 --> 00:43.890
called.

00:45.530 --> 00:47.460
They input these type texts.

00:47.460 --> 00:48.680
So I will remove this.

00:49.700 --> 00:56.810
The placeholder will be six digits called and this is.

00:58.160 --> 01:04.890
Six digits called and the we need the the variable.

01:04.910 --> 01:13.220
So let's add you set up and we will get the code is equal to ref.

01:16.030 --> 01:19.750
It's imported from view and let's return the code.

01:20.260 --> 01:26.540
So the code will be this value here when you go for the submit function.

01:26.560 --> 01:35.500
So let's create a function submit and this will be an empty function for the moment and let's return

01:35.500 --> 01:36.010
it here.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.150
So that's it.

01:41.450 --> 01:50.720
And, uh, no, uh, we want to redirect to this component when we get the data from the logging forum.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.970
So a lot here.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.640
Also the authenticator form.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.760
Don't forget also to import, uh, this, uh, component.

02:01.570 --> 02:01.910
No.

02:02.320 --> 02:02.590
Oh.

02:02.590 --> 02:08.680
Create also a variable log in data, which is equal to.

02:09.900 --> 02:18.510
Uh, reactive, and by default, I'll set the I.D. to zero.

02:20.370 --> 02:24.370
So, uh, we need to remove these log in data here.

02:25.560 --> 02:30.550
And the way that we will use this variable now is like this.

02:30.570 --> 02:34.650
So we will set the the logging data directly is equal to the event.

02:35.730 --> 02:39.300
So this is similar by default, right?

02:39.300 --> 02:44.900
You will be zero because every time we logging, we will get every time an idea.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.550
And the other values are optional.

02:48.060 --> 02:54.000
Now we will show the logging form if we if here.

02:55.060 --> 02:59.560
The login data that ID is equal to zero.

03:00.340 --> 03:09.400
The other case is a when we show the authenticator form in the login data that it should not be equal

03:09.400 --> 03:10.380
to zero.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.610
So this is how it will work.

03:13.330 --> 03:21.160
When we submit the form, we will change the login data and when we change this will probably change

03:21.160 --> 03:26.590
and we will show the other form, but we will keep the data here.

03:27.460 --> 03:31.420
We need to pass that data now to the authenticator form.

03:31.750 --> 03:36.430
So to do that, let's go to the authenticator form and we need to wait here.

03:37.090 --> 03:46.000
Props and the props will be login data that we will send in those props.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.220
We will get it from the set up here.

03:48.220 --> 03:58.060
Props is a and it can be like this or we can set the login data as any.

04:00.450 --> 04:06.510
Uh, also, let's, uh, change the language to TypeScript.

04:07.290 --> 04:16.530
So the props has, uh, our log in data and we will use the data to submit the alt indicator form.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.840
So let's do it now.

04:19.110 --> 04:24.570
Let's import actions from actors.

04:25.230 --> 04:28.440
And here let's make the function a synchronous.

04:32.110 --> 04:34.960
And we will get a response.

04:36.220 --> 04:39.780
It will be equal to a tweet Axios post.

04:41.470 --> 04:43.930
Two, two factor.

04:44.830 --> 04:51.850
And the data that we will send are the log in data that we get from the props, the props that log in

04:51.850 --> 04:55.690
data along with the code.

04:55.870 --> 05:03.880
So the code by default will be empty and this will be code is equal to code that value because we are

05:03.880 --> 05:07.300
using Earth and that should be it.

05:07.450 --> 05:16.900
So now I forgot also another thing that this request needs with credentials to throw

05:19.540 --> 05:25.810
into the log in form probably does not need now with credentials to true because we will not get the

05:25.810 --> 05:26.560
cookie there.

05:27.070 --> 05:30.100
So that is something that I forgot to change.

05:30.700 --> 05:36.760
So this request is like this and this will get the the cookie.

05:36.760 --> 05:43.540
And also in the response we will get the data that we will set it to access.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.120
So I'll copy the code here.

05:47.990 --> 05:51.080
And the old pasted to the authenticator forms.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.070
So axis defaults header score is equal to.

05:56.200 --> 05:56.800
Data.

05:57.340 --> 05:58.340
That token.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.390
And that should be it.

06:01.780 --> 06:04.420
But we are still not finished yet.

06:04.570 --> 06:09.670
Let's just test the part that we are a direct to the other form.

06:10.270 --> 06:16.630
So I'll use the B2B dot com or I will use this user ID a dot com a.

06:19.180 --> 06:19.810
Signing.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.840
And we still don't get the form.

06:24.620 --> 06:27.200
So very the request is successful.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.400
So not sure why this is happening.

06:31.430 --> 06:38.360
I guess this is not the right way or of using a reactive variable.

06:38.780 --> 06:42.380
So I will recreate the function again.

06:43.370 --> 06:57.110
So set logging data and we'll get the data here and we will all return it here.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.710
And we will set login data here.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.380
So when we set the data.

07:05.450 --> 07:12.980
First we will set the ID log in data that ID is equal to the data that I do.

07:14.460 --> 07:27.540
And if there were other values are set, which in this case is the data that the secret is set, then

07:27.630 --> 07:34.800
we will set the log in data that the secret is equal to data.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.550
That's secret.

07:37.710 --> 07:40.230
And the other value, which is.

07:42.780 --> 07:48.060
This value which I copied so ought to be a health URL.

07:49.380 --> 07:52.920
So these values are optional.

07:52.980 --> 08:00.720
We are not actually, uh, started with but the they may be or they may be not.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.900
So I think this is the key.

08:03.930 --> 08:07.530
So, uh, that it will work?

08:07.530 --> 08:07.920
No.

08:08.310 --> 08:10.110
And also, I forgot something else.

08:10.110 --> 08:15.840
We have to pass this logging data to the authenticator form, which we didn't.

08:15.960 --> 08:22.920
So if we go back, we will add the logging data is equal to this logging data.

08:23.550 --> 08:30.960
So the difference here is that we receive events here and we set these two values here.

08:31.980 --> 08:32.760
I'll save it.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.320
Let's try again.

08:34.320 --> 08:44.220
Now A that column A and we are redirected now it is expecting us to put the authenticator code which

08:44.220 --> 08:46.170
we will do it in the next tutorial.
