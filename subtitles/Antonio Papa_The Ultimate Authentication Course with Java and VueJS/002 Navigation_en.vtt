WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:05.610
So we had the signing form and now we want to have the head there for this up.

00:05.610 --> 00:11.370
So let's go to bootstrap again, go to examples and let's select Heather here.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.530
I will inspect.

00:14.730 --> 00:21.820
The Black Heather here and the old copy the is the email directly all copied.

00:22.230 --> 00:28.950
I'll go to update view and the old piece to this header on top here.

00:30.130 --> 00:33.370
And it will look like this older move bootstrap.

00:33.370 --> 00:35.320
No, because we don't need it anymore.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.900
Let's make some changes here.

00:39.400 --> 00:44.800
The first change that I will make is not in the in the email here.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.350
Actually, I will create a new component.

00:49.330 --> 00:53.590
A view component, I'll call it now in the here.

00:54.460 --> 01:06.190
I will cut this estimate and I will move it to the NAV component and this component will be added here

01:06.310 --> 01:09.580
instead of adding a lot of each the MLA.

01:09.580 --> 01:12.730
So now like this.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.060
Also, don't forget to import that component.

01:16.060 --> 01:18.880
I'll cut this code old movie here.

01:20.500 --> 01:28.570
And the first thing that we need is to import the component from this symbol stands for the source folder.

01:29.110 --> 01:35.620
Slash components less now and we need to use it here in the components.

01:35.860 --> 01:43.930
When we export this, we can use a component like this and we can see our up is working the same.

01:44.380 --> 01:47.050
Now let's go to the nav component.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.580
Let's remove what we don't need.

01:50.590 --> 02:00.040
We don't need this bootstrap building here, and I'll remove all the, uh, list items here except for

02:00.040 --> 02:02.580
the features and the features.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.090
Older name it to home.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.410
So that's it.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.630
We have the home component which we will create later.

02:11.650 --> 02:21.190
I will remove the form and we have login sign up or rename thing with the register and I'll put the

02:21.190 --> 02:25.660
same classes because I don't like the button with that color.

02:28.090 --> 02:29.560
And that should be it.

02:30.580 --> 02:38.170
So we had the header and now let's order the home and the register component or not add them.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.090
Here are all added interviews.

02:40.090 --> 02:43.030
So let's add the first.

02:43.150 --> 02:54.760
We will add the the login view and here for the template, I'll cut the code for this form.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.120
And I'll put it here.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.210
And if I add the log in here.

03:07.050 --> 03:10.740
It will work the same so we can see the log in form here.

03:11.160 --> 03:20.040
But still we need to add more components like the register component, etc. and we don't need to change

03:20.040 --> 03:22.110
every time the component here manually.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.190
So instead we will use URL to view.

03:26.850 --> 03:30.080
So this will remove the log in component.

03:30.090 --> 03:39.840
Now this will render components based on the path in the URL here on top.

03:40.350 --> 03:45.330
And for that, we need to add also that component in there, out there.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.840
So here, let's get the component.

03:51.840 --> 04:00.840
We need the path which will be slash logging and for the component, we need the logging component.

04:01.890 --> 04:12.360
So let me import the logging component in import logging from it stands for the source folder components

04:12.420 --> 04:22.410
slash not component sorry views logging that view and that's it.

04:22.530 --> 04:26.850
So I added this component and now it's not appearing.

04:26.850 --> 04:31.350
But if we go to slash logging, we can see that component here.

04:31.860 --> 04:34.110
Let's do the same note for the register.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.230
So I'll copy this.

04:37.230 --> 04:40.860
Log into the view all pasted here and all the names to register.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.530
The register form will be almost the same.

04:46.530 --> 04:47.940
But we need more fields.

04:47.940 --> 04:52.640
So old copy this in the PC two times older.

04:52.980 --> 04:54.900
Remove this ID here.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.860
And the type email.

05:01.470 --> 05:04.710
This will be the first name.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.220
First name.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.770
Same for this type email here.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.970
And this is the last name.

05:19.510 --> 05:26.810
Well then move this also and I'll do the same with the email or remove this and this.

05:28.340 --> 05:31.070
And for the buzzard I'll do the same.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.130
We need another password.

05:34.130 --> 05:35.050
Confusion field.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.170
Although remove this.

05:37.740 --> 05:38.700
And this part.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.220
Same for the password confusion.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.770
And this is password confusion.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.930
But to confirm.

05:52.780 --> 05:57.400
Now let's call it also in the rotor, so I'll duplicate this.

05:58.590 --> 06:04.680
The path this time is register and the component will be registered.

06:06.380 --> 06:10.730
Register here that view and register here.

06:13.080 --> 06:18.900
And if we go now to slash register, we will see the form.

06:19.290 --> 06:24.390
Now let's also make these links work so we can go to the right component.

06:24.810 --> 06:36.300
Four, go to the nav component and I'll change these buttons to a router link and this will link to

06:36.990 --> 06:38.280
slash login.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.600
Same for the register button.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.290
So I wrote the link to.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.500
Register like this.

06:55.850 --> 07:02.000
And if we click log in, we'll go to a logging component and if we click the register, we will go to

07:02.000 --> 07:03.200
the register component.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.580
So we are working fine.

07:05.150 --> 07:09.090
Now let's add the last component, which is the home component.

07:11.120 --> 07:25.760
Here I will add a div with a class of container margin top five in the text center and inside all will

07:25.940 --> 07:36.110
the needs three and inside all three just hello for the moment old remove this and the left side it

07:36.110 --> 07:37.280
also to the outer.

07:38.510 --> 07:39.530
All this.

07:39.530 --> 07:44.960
And this is the home birth and the component will be home.

07:48.020 --> 07:52.380
And this is home as well and that's it.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.850
We need also to add the rotary link here.

07:56.270 --> 08:06.880
So I'll remove this and this is rotary link to just slash and let's do it now on the browser.

08:06.890 --> 08:08.840
When we click home, we will see.

08:08.870 --> 08:09.590
Hello here.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.080
So that's it.

08:11.090 --> 08:18.620
We added the navigation and now in the next tutorial let's try to register and I will change this to

08:18.650 --> 08:19.820
just register.

08:25.190 --> 08:26.570
And this is submit.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.370
So let's try to register in the next tutorial.
