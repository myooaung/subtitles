00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.225
Well done for reaching this stage of the course.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:04.875
We've covered a lot so far,

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:06.480
and I hope it makes sense.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.355
If you're still struggling to understand certain parts, don't worry too much.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.050
As you keep going on with this course,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.495
you'll get lots more chance to practice.

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:20.190
You've already covered most of the core concepts of UGS already.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.785
In this video, we're going to download and display the image onto the card.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:33.310
Already, we've been passed the image name finally display image prop, which is just here.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.070
Inside of our image, our profile.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.245
We can setup a watch property to detect changes caused when the user uploads a new image.

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:49.780
Scrolling down, I'm just going to add this just below the props.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.730
I'm going to add the watch property.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.420
We're going to watch this display image property. Add that inside there.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.575
Inside here we want to communicate with Firebase to download the image.

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:21.800
First we need to import Firebase into this file.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.535
Just underneath the opening script tag,

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:31.190
going to import Firebase from Firebase.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.760
Then next we need to add a storage reference,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.420
just like we did inside the image input components.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.740
Go over to the image upload.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.590
If you remember, inside this upload file section,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.895
we added a storage reference which pushes the name of the file up to Firebase.

00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:59.480
I'm going to copy this line of code and then go back over to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.400
the image outputs and add this inside of the watch property.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.890
This is going to create a variable called storage reference,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.490
which refers to a file inside the database.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.120
This time instead of pushing this top file,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.035
we want to refer to it with this dot display image,

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:27.570
which is a name of the image which we passed.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.160
We can then use the storage reference with

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.445
the get download URL method to fetch the URL for this file.

00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:45.880
Just below, we're going to access the storage reference which we just

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.290
created and then dot get download URL.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.490
Again, this is a method provided by Firebase.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.555
This problem is resolved successfully.

00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:06.860
Then we assign a callback function to run.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.560
We also need to pass in the URL into the parenthesis which we have just downloaded.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.205
Now we have the image's URL.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.445
We can add the code to set the image source.

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:32.675
Remember we don't have a image source just above.

00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:38.500
We can access this image via its id of output image.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.100
Inside of this body,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.200
will we create our variable of image and set this to

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.490
the image id with document.getElementById.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.980
The image Id was output image.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.660
Then we can set the image dot source to be equal to this URL, which will be in past.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.075
Give that a save. This is a pretty simple example to download the image.

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:21.760
We can go even further by adding error handling

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.890
too but I don't want to go too deep into Firebase for now.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:33.140
Save that and start up the development server and we can check this is working okay.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.030
Go to the projects choose a file.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.920
Great. Now, we see the image has been successfully downloaded from Firebase.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.895
This means our code is all well confined.

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:55.380
There is a small problem however and

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.385
if you can't see the image displayed on the right-hand side,

00:04:58.385 --> 00:05:00.995
you may have already experienced this.

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:05.245
If you've uploaded an image for the first time,

00:05:05.245 --> 00:05:08.925
you may not see this appearing inside the card.

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:11.325
Let's take a look at the problem.

00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:19.040
If we go over to choose new file and have a new image on the desktop,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.025
which is not yet being pushed to Firebase.

00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:27.685
If we select this, we see that this doesn't work.

00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:34.030
When we select an image file to use VUGS passages filename to the parents.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.850
This filename is passed to the child component,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.645
which then tries to download the image much in this file name.

00:05:40.645 --> 00:05:44.560
The problem is, this happens a lot faster than the time it

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.895
takes to actually upload the image to the Firebase server.

00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:51.400
This means [inaudible] we are trying to download

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.300
an image before it's even been uploaded to Firebase.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.135
If we've already uploaded a certain image like the beach image from before,

00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:06.835
it will not cause a problem because the image is already available inside the Firebase.

00:06:06.835 --> 00:06:09.880
This is a problem which we can fix pretty easily.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.920
We'll take a look at doing this in the next video.
