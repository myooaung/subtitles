00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.865
During this section, we've used CSS to create animations and transitions in our app.

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:10.495
Vgs also provides us with JavaScript hooks,

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:14.335
which we can use during certain phases of the transition.

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.945
If you remember from earlier in the course,

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:21.835
we looked at how we could use Hook's during various lifecycle stages.

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:25.555
Well, transition Hook's work like this too.

00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:29.770
By using these hooks, we have access to all the features which

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.910
JavaScript officers not limited to just apply in CSS.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.665
He can see the various hooks which we can use.

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:40.640
Just like the transition classes.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.470
We have a enter and leave in phase,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.720
both with four hooks each.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.885
Below these self-explanatory.

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:50.540
But will begin with before enter.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.185
As it sounds, this hook is called on the beginning before the enter phase begins.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:01:01.915
We then have enter which runs wants to transition has begun the interface.

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:05.810
The final hook of the interphase is after enter,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.660
and this is called 1C elements or components,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.595
has finished the transition in.

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:14.200
The final enter hook is called Enter canceled.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.025
This is useful to have if the transmission gets canceled while in progress.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:21.860
For example, if VCO becomes false,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.090
before the transition has had a chance to complete,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.150
here we can do some cleanup work or restore the transition back to its original state.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.600
We also have the same on the leaf phase but before leave,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.295
leave, after leave, and then also leave canceled.

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:43.640
Applying this is an easier is relatively easy to do.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.520
All we need to do is add whichever hooks you want to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.195
use as an attribute to the transition elements.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:55.285
For example, here we have the enter and leave hooks as our attributes.

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:58.550
So these are the hooks we have available to use.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.640
Now let's go back to the project and see them in action.
