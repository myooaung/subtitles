00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
In this section, we're going to continue with our app and allow

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.395
users to upload images to display on the card.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:10.500
These images need somewhere to be stored.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.065
For this, I'm going to be using Firebase,

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:15.360
which is part of Google.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.575
We'll use one of the Firebase features, which is storage.

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:21.420
Although it can be used for much more,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.415
including databases and authentication for platforms such as iOS, Android, and web.

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:35.740
If you head over to the web browser and head over to Google,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.960
let's do a search for Firebase.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.230
Current access Firebase at firebase.google.com,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.970
which is the top result.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.670
Firebase is free to use and has generous usage limits to test with.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.800
There are pricing plans to,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.865
but you'll only need these if you app grows to require these.

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.790
If you want to find out more about Firebase,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.475
feel free to look over this website,

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:14.620
and then I'm going to begin by going over to the console.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.170
You may need to sign in to Google first to get to this stage,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.650
so I've signed in with your Google account.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.720
If you have one, if not,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.550
it's straightforward to set one up.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.165
Just follow along with the instructions,

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:31.320
and then click on Go to console.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.710
So then once you're taken to the screen,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.385
we can click on Add projects,

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:38.445
and then add a project name,

00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:41.620
I'm going to call mine Creative Cards App,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.450
and then select your country, click Create Project,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.660
and just give them a moment to set up.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.975
Then we're taken to a welcome screen,

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:08.020
and just as a side note,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.300
websites like these have a habit of changing layouts over time,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.015
so if your version looks a little bit different to mine, don't worry,

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:20.155
it just usually means a button or menu link has been moved,

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:22.855
both things generally work the same.

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:27.145
Then to get started, we can either add our project to iOS,

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:33.470
Android, or web, so we're going to click on Add Firebase to your web app.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.590
We kind of copy the full set of code, but I'm not going to,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.535
because this includes a script tag for Firebase,

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:48.210
and I'm going to be adding Firebase as an npm package,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.295
so we don't need this section.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:55.730
All we need is the initialized section from within the second script,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.220
so we copy this section without the script tags,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.890
and then if we go back over to our app.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.320
We're going to create a new file inside our projects,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.505
and this file will contain all this Firebase setup code.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:16.085
I'm going to call this firebase Config,

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:20.170
and this is going to be created in the root of our source.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.990
So open up a new file called firebaseConfig.js,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.260
inside it's empty file we can paste in the initialization

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.680
that we just copied from Firebase and save that.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.750
So these are the sections that we need to use Firebase,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.675
it contains our unique API key.

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:48.215
So Firebase knows who is accessing the information,

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:52.350
along with links to the location of our projects.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.050
Then we need to add the Firebase package to our project with the Node Package Manager.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.135
If you open up the terminal,

00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:05.810
make sure you're in the project folder if using a separate console.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.910
If using Visual Studio Code,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.230
just head down to the bottom,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.455
and make sure that the server is closed by pressing Control C,

00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:22.250
then we can install Firebase by using npm install dash, dash, save,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.575
to save is as a dependency,

00:04:24.575 --> 00:04:30.840
and the name of the package is simply Firebase, and hit Enter.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.750
Then just give that a few moments to install,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.770
it shouldn't take too long.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.870
Once it's done, we can go over to the package.json file,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.810
and we now see within the dependencies object,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.415
we have Firebase alongside view.

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:54.890
So the first thing we now need to do is to import

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.760
Firebase inside the firebase.config file.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.820
So at the top,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.780
we can import Firebase from Firebase,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.710
and remember, we don't need to add the full file path

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.355
to Firebase when it's a Node module.

00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:20.545
I like to use a capital letter for the module name,

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:25.065
so I'm going to change this one just at the bottom to match.

00:05:25.065 --> 00:05:27.770
Now we have our settings file also,

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.020
open it to add this to the root of our project, which is App.vue.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.025
Scroll down to the script tags,

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:39.750
and then we can import this section,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.250
so import FirebaseConfig,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.600
so this is./firebaseConfig.js.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.405
To make sure everything is set-up okay,

00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:08.930
it'll probably make sense now to start up the service,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.580
so go down to the terminal and run npm, run dev.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.914
Then we can go into the project,

00:06:18.914 --> 00:06:22.120
and we can open up the console.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.620
So right-click and inspect.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.925
If you go into the console and you have no red arrows,

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:35.410
this is a good sign that everything is working okay,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.610
if you do have any red arrows,

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.940
make sure you go back and fix those before moving on.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.720
This is all we need now to add Firebase to our app.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.840
It doesn't do anything at the moment, but in the next video,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.460
we'll look at creating the image,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.970
upload components to push images back to Firebase.
