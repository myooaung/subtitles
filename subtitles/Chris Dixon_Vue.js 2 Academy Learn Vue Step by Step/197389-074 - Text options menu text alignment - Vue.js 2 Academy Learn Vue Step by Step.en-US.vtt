00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.515
Our menu is now appearing when we the hover over the text,

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:10.150
and we have also successfully added a select input to change the font size.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.435
Now we can continue with the menu and add some more options.

00:00:14.435 --> 00:00:18.880
Specifically free buttons to set the text alignment.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.575
It will follow a similar process to the select box but this time we'll use radio buttons.

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.210
If you feel confident, I would encourage you to go ahead and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.005
give this a go on your own before following along with me.

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:40.480
If not, I'm going to go ahead now and do this over inside the text output.vue file.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.410
Back up to the templates at the top.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.820
If we look for the closing select option,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.920
let's create some space and make sure this is still within the form.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.520
I'm going to begin by adding a div,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.455
then we're going to add some bootstrap classes to make this look a little nicer.

00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:13.180
The first one is going to be form check then also form check in line.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:26.800
Then we can ask the label also the bootstrap class of the form check label.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.390
Then within this, in fact,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.570
we can add our input between the label.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.940
The input is going to be the type of radio.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.650
Some classes for styling or form

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:58.085
check inputs and then finally you can add a value.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:01.410
The first one I'm going to set to left,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.605
so this is for the left alignment.

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:11.940
I'm going to copy this full div section and paste in two more times.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.280
The middle one is going to be to align the text into the center and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.640
the last one is going to be for the left alignment and just after the input,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.440
we're going to add the text.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.000
The first one is left,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.280
center, and then right.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.280
Then just like we did with the select box,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.850
we can also set up a data property to pass the selected value to.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.635
Back down to the script,

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:52.665
just underneath set font size,

00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:54.320
that we used in the last video,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.155
we're going to do the same here but this time set the text line.

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:07.280
This is going to be an empty string to begin with and too will pass some data to this.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.070
Now we have our data property we can set up two-way data binding using V model,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.830
so back up to the inputs.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.820
First of all, we're going to add V-model as an attribute to the left section.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.200
V-model this is going to be sets text-align.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.480
This will be the same for all three of these inputs,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.030
so we can add this as an attribute to

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.860
the center and also to the right.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.150
Make sure that the two-way data binding is all set to the same dates property.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.440
This sets up, set text align with the value from our radio bone,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.340
which you've added here, which you can then pass into our style objects.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.565
Scrolling down, let's take a look for the style object inside of the computed section.

00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:19.630
We'll do the same as we did before with the font size by setting

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.080
the text-align and this is going to be this.set text-align.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.460
This is all we need to do, so we can go over to the browser and check it's all working.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:50.005
Add some texts into here and then hover over center, right, and left.

00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:52.550
Well done if you've managed to do this on your own,

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.485
if not, it's completely fine.

00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:58.100
This is all now working so can now move on to the next video and

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.000
complete this menu section by adding the bold and italic options.
