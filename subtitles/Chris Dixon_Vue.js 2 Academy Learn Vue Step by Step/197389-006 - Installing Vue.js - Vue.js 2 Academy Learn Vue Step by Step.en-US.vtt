00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.730
In the last video, we should have downloaded the project starter,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.120
which I've placed on my desktop for easy access.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.825
You should also have a text editor ready to use.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.155
In my case, I'm using Visual Studio Code.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.320
In this video we're going to show you a few examples of

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.325
how we can get started with installing Vue.js.

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:26.220
I'm going to go over to my web browser

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.280
and I'm going to be using Chrome for the rest of this course.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.404
Then we're going to go over to Vue.js.org,

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:36.985
which is the official website for Vue.js.

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:42.075
If you click on the guide on the top right-hand corner,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.015
and then once it loads up,

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:47.035
you should see a navigation menu on the left.

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:51.005
To begin, we need to go on to the installation menu,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:55.910
and he will provide you with some options of how to get started.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.615
The first one is how to include Vue.js Within script tags,

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:06.820
so we can click on either the development version or the production version.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.450
The development version has the debug mode and also the warnings.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.810
The production version doesn't have these and it's minified.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.090
All we need to do is click on one of these buttons and then we get the download,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.290
then we can save these files inside of

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.785
our application and link to them using script tags.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:30.295
This technique is just the same as including any of your scripts such as j-query.

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:32.955
Another option is to use the CDN link,

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:35.220
we shall be using for this project.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.185
This is a link where the Vue.js library is hosted externally.

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:43.275
If we click on the recommended link there,

00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:46.830
wouldn't taken to a hosted version of Vue.js,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.180
and this is the latest version.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.800
Will come back to this just in a moments.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.260
The next option is using NPM or the Node Package Manager.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.520
We will be using NPM In the next project,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.620
but for now I just want to keep things simple,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.720
we'll focus on Vue.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.380
js and then in the basics.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.080
There's also the Vue.cli,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.960
which is an easy way to scaffold out Vue.js projects.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.925
Again, we'll use this later on,

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:20.010
but for now I'm just going to go up to the CDN link and then click on the link,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.290
and then we need it copy this URL link.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.690
Then if we go back over to your text editor and then open up the projects.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.785
If we go over to the index.html,

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:37.700
when it go to the head section just below the title,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.960
and then add in the script tags,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.070
and then we can add the source attributes and then paste in the link to the Vue.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.045
js library, and then save that.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:54.580
That's how quick and easy is to add Vue.js as a CDN link.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.840
With Vue.js now added to our app,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.010
we'll now move on to the next video where we'll take a look at adding the Vue.instance.
