Congratulations on getting to the end of this section.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.710
I hope you've enjoyed learning all about how

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.780
we can add transitions and animations to our projects.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.300
Hopefully can now see that even just by adding some small effects to our apps,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.180
it can really finish them off and make them look and feel a lot nicer for the user.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.180
This is another great feature of the Vue.js

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.390
framework and I hope you've really enjoyed this section.
