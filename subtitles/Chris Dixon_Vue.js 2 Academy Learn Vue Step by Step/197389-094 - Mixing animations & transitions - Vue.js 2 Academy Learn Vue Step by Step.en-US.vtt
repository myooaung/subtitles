00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
We have looked at using both transitions and animations independently so far.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.020
Both of these can also be mixed to work together too.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.370
To do this, we do need to remove the don't call mark from the app.vue file.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.490
Let's go and do that now inside the app.vue and down inside the method,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.100
we can remove the done,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.270
second arguments, and then also the call to it at the end of our method.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.550
Give us save. We remove this because it stops VGS from detecting the CSS transitions,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.500
which we will be using.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.425
So let us begin by going over to the imageoutputs.vue file.

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:48.080
I'm first going to cut the styles from here and then move

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.225
them to the main app.js file within the style tags.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:56.160
So let's start by cutting the scale.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.860
Scale enter-active right down to the keyframes.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.340
So cut those outside of the image output,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.735
save that and then head over to the app.vue.

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:16.740
Down in style we can add these below the fake classes. So paste that in there.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.065
With these styles now available globally,

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.135
we can use them throughout the app.

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:28.025
As an example, we can mix in scale animation with the existing fade.

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:32.805
So what I'm going to do first is splits up the fade-enter-active,

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:37.515
and also the fade-leave-active onto their own lines.

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:40.635
This is how we can use them independently.

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:47.000
So I'm going to cut and paste this in action with the fade enter and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.600
the second one and also remove the fade-leave from the first one.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.194
We can now mixing the scale in and scale out animations,

00:01:59.194 --> 00:02:01.385
but change the durations to be longer.

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:03.775
Let's say two seconds.

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:07.245
So inside the fade-enter-active,

00:02:07.245 --> 00:02:12.105
going to keep the transition of the opacity for this time,

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:15.355
we're going to mix it with animation.

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:19.409
Let's add the animation of scaling.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.350
This time over a duration of two seconds.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.850
Rapidly scaling animation, we set with the keyframes below.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.380
Start this one here. When fading now as well,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.850
we can also use scale out.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.100
Let's do this inside the fade-leave-active.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.055
We can an animation,

00:02:44.055 --> 00:02:49.570
use the scale keyframes over a duration of two seconds.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.840
Now let's save that and go over to the browser and see how this is looking.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.640
So make it a little bit smaller so we can see it coming in and out.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.950
Great. So it doesn't look pretty,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.480
but you can see as a demonstration,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.825
how the animation and transition, both work together.

00:03:13.825 --> 00:03:16.820
Now have an animation and transition,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.340
but both flowing for different durations,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.640
things can be a little bit messed up.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.310
We do need tell VGS if we want the animation,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.185
all the transition be a priority for time in.

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:35.075
We do this inside of the transition elements by setting the transition type.

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:39.020
So let's go back over to the editor and find the transition

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.055
wrapper which you've been using. Just here.

00:03:44.055 --> 00:03:46.085
Just after the JavaScript hook,

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:48.300
we can add a type.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.370
Let's set the priority for animation and see how let's look in.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.620
So therefore the animation is a priority.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.140
Let's change this to transition and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.240
then save and now we can see it does look a little bit different.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.470
It doesn't quite work for our application,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.605
but it does show you how we can set the type or the priority for the transition.

00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:26.600
I am going to remove this type as we don't need it.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.055
This is because I'm also going to remove the animation from the CSS.

00:04:31.055 --> 00:04:35.340
Let's remove the type and then down to the styles,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.460
let's remove the animations that we just added because you don't need these for our use.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.820
So give us save and hopefully it should return back to normal.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.930
Great. This is how we can set if we want a transition or

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.560
an animation to take priority when mixing both types
