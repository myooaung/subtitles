00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.310
We're making good progress with our knowledge of how components work.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.870
In this video, I want to create the additional card components.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.840
We already have the card from components,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.975
but we still need to create the CardInsideLeft,

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:19.530
inside right, and also the CardBack files.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.795
If you feel confident doing this,

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:26.875
feel free to go ahead and create these single file components by yourself.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:32.585
For now the content just needs to be the same as the CardFront.vue file.

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:35.930
You can copy this over to get started with.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.415
Also, you will need to import these into the App.vue file,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:44.015
and then also register them as components.

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:46.925
Make sure when we register the components,

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:49.700
we name them the same as we have given them in

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.020
the menu navigation or in the Header.vue file.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.055
Otherwise, they won't link to the correct page.

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:05.450
To get started, I'm going to go over to the CardFront.vue file,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.580
select all, and then copy,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.390
and then if we go over to our menu,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.820
on the left, and then inside the card folder,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.620
I'm going to create a new file,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.950
and this one is going to be called CardInsideLeft,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.210
with the dot vue extension,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.200
and then paste it in the contents here, save that.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.840
We don't need to worry too much about the content for now,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.505
we'll build these up with child components as we need to,

00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:42.260
just so we can see which page was selected.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.230
I'm just going to add some text inside the first section just saying CardInsideLeft,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.955
and this is so we know which section we run when we click on the dynamic components.

00:01:55.955 --> 00:02:02.765
Now, we can import the components inside the App.vue and then register it.

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:05.700
If you go down to the script,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.010
and then we can import the CardInsideLeft,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.210
and then we pull this from the components folder.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.970
Inside here, we have a card folder and the file name is CardInsideLeft,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.265
and then of course down in the component section,

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.200
separated by a comma,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.140
we add the CardInsideLeft

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.020
and set this to the same name that we've called it here, of CardInsideLeft.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.525
Remember we don't need to add these elements inside of the template,

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.610
like we've done with the nav header.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.865
Because this component is going to switch between

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:06.700
all these pages follows when we select them inside of the menu.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.970
Now, all we need to do is repeat the same process and create

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.950
two more sections or two more single file components.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.945
I'm going to begin with the CardInsideRight component.

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:24.520
Inside the card folder we'll create CardInsideRight,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.995
again with the dot vue extension.

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:33.020
This can also have the same contents of the inside left,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.595
so let's select all,

00:03:34.595 --> 00:03:38.680
copy, and then paste it in the contents.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.590
Just so you can tell the difference,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.950
I'm going to change the text to inside right and then save that,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.850
and then finally we also have the CardBack, which we need to add.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.650
CardBack.vue, and then paste

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.850
in the same contents and change the text to CardBack.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.575
Back over to the App.vue,

00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:20.795
and I'm just going to copy this import statement and then paste this in twice.

00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:24.730
The second one is inside right.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.540
Changing inside the name and also inside the file path,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.790
and then finally we have CardBack,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.090
and then down inside of the instance we can

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.330
add inside the component section our new components.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.780
CardInsideRight,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.850
and then finally the CardBack components.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.435
That should be is now done.

00:05:15.435 --> 00:05:18.600
With the four card components now in place,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.680
we can make sure our dev server is running,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.085
and then go over to the browser.

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:26.450
If everything is working correctly,

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.270
we should now be able to click on each one of

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.845
the menu links and see our new components displayed.

00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:39.600
We can see this is working with the texts that we added inside of each.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.990
Great, so now with that in place,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.130
we're making good progress with our application.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.360
Now, it's time to move on and begin creating the text input components.
