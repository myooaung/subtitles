00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
Welcome to this new section.

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:07.245
We will begin to take a deeper look into what Vue.js has to offer.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.070
We'll continue to build our guest list up by

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.060
adding new features and learning more about Vue.js,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.460
such as computed properties, watches, and filters.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.800
By the end of this section,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.400
you will have a good understanding of a lot of the Vue.js

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.450
essentials and how it all fits together after completing your first project.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.190
