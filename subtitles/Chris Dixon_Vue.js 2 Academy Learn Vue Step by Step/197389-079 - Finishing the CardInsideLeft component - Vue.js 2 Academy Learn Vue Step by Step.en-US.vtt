00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.535
The card transaction we've been working on so far is now completed.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:09.510
We can now reuse a text and image components to put

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.175
together the different sides of the card beginning with the inside left.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:18.510
The inside left is a simple section which has a text inputs and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.825
a full height text output so the user can add

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:26.655
a block of text in the card inside left file.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:29.200
Inside the current section,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.275
all we have so far is the containers and some classes.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:37.710
Because we're using the text input and output components,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.930
we can begin by importing them so we can use them inside this file.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.370
Down in the script, we can add our import.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:57.370
The first one is the text inputs and file puff is./TextInputs.vue.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.470
We can also do the same for the text outputs.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.870
Import the text output.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.560
The component elements are the same as

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.160
card front so we can copy and paste this into our inside left hand plates.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.420
Head over to the card front and then up to the templates.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.780
First of all, I'm going to select

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.740
the cc-text-inputs and then bring this over to the card inside left.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.240
We can now remove the text from the top and then paste in the cc-text-inputs.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.855
We can also do the same with the text output,

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:01.120
so copy this from the card front.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.430
I'm going to copy this first one and then add this inside the card display side.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.520
The output components will be the height of the card,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.000
which is 800 pixels.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.725
I'm going to set the container height of this to be 750.

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:28.000
This is all can allow for some podium.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.735
Now there is the data to add for our text box values.

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:41.490
We only have one text input so the only data property we need to add is text box value 1.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.150
Just blow the imports, we can set up our data.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.150
Let's add the export default and then our data.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.720
We're going to return the text box value 1.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.790
Just like we've done previously,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.890
we'll set this to an initial value of an empty string.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.525
Then finally, we also need to register

00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:18.760
our components to make them available in this file,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.255
so just below the data,

00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:24.820
add comma and then we can add our components.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.170
We need to add the cc text inputs,

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.110
then add a comma.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.490
We can also do the same for

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.380
the cc text outputs,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.600
and save that.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.645
Let's now open this up in the browser and see how it's looking.

00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:02.560
If we go over to the inside left,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.145
we can see we have our text components on the left,

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:10.510
and we can see we've got the dotted border for the outputs on the right.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.470
Some of the stylings are missing so we may need to go over to the card front

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.810
and then go down to the styles and remove the scope section.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.310
This then applies to all the current sections but inside left.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.240
Now we can see we've got the same styles as the front.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.905
This looks like it's all working okay,

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:39.020
we just need to type in some texts.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.790
We can see all appearing on the output section.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.630
If yours looks like this,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.110
we are now ready to move on to the inside right section.
