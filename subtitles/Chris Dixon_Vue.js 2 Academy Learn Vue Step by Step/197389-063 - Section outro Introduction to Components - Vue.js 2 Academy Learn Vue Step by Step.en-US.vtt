00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.025
Hi. It is Chris again.

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:05.565
I just want to take a quick breather at this stage.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:11.595
We've already covered a lot of grounds and learned a lot about components,

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.745
and how they can communicate with each other.

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:18.900
Our project is also coming along nicely now, too,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.120
but we still have lots of features and improvements to add in the next section,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.450
such as using Firebase to store our images,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.650
and also allowing users to set the style of the text.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.535
I will see you in the next section, where by the end,

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:41.109
you will have a completed fully-functional greeting card application.
