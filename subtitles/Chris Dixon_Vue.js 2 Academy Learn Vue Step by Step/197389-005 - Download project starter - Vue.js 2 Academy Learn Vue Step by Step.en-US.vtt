00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.870
Attached this video is a starter project

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.260
which we're going to use to jump straight into vue js.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.610
I want to download mine and place it onto the desktop for easy access.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.920
But you can place yours anywhere.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.650
Just as long as it's convenient for you.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.235
Now you should already have your text editor all set up.

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:25.200
I'm going to open Visual Studio Code and then once it opens,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.490
I'm going to drag the project starter over into the text editor.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.195
Then let's take a little look at what's included.

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:38.430
If we open up the index.html,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.760
it's just a basic HMO's data.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.845
In head section we just have some basic meta tags, the title.

00:00:46.845 --> 00:00:49.830
We also have some links to bootstrap.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.875
We are just going to use this for some basic styling and layout.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.140
The body of the project starts with a main div,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.895
which has an id of app.

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:01.910
This is going to be the main container and we'll take

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.620
a look at this in more detail when we look at the view instance.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.915
Well then, you just have some basic rows and

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:12.170
containers and some information about the guest list.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.530
If we open up the project folder and then if we double-click on index.html.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.365
You can then see the basic structure of what we have.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:29.135
We have a row which has some information about the events,

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:30.800
such as the event date,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.565
the event title and a description.

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:36.500
We also have a text input where the user can add

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.055
their name and then submit it to add it to the guest list.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.940
Then below that we have another row and then an overall below this,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.315
which is going to be the place where all the names are added to.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:50.165
At the moment it says no names added yet.

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:54.545
But we'll add the functionality throughout this section to make this work.

00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:56.840
Over in the app.css we just have

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.265
some basic styling just to make it look a little bit nicer.

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:03.090
The app.js is empty for now.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.760
But this is the place where we'll add

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.345
the view JS functionality as we go through this section.

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:14.440
This is just a basic overview of what's included with the project as a start-up package.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.080
This will become a lot more familiar as you go through this section.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.550
Next up we'll look at how to install vue js and how to add it to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.955
the starter projects and then we'll begin working

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:30.870
inside this app.js by taking a look at the view instance.
