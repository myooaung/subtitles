00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.170
During this section, we'll be setting up our

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.515
next up in a slightly different way to last time.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.670
We'll be using a tool called the View CLI.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.870
We'll look at the view CLI and what it can do for us in the next video.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.010
But for now we need to install Node JS and NPM,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.985
which we both required for the view CLIT to run.

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:27.390
I'm going to go over to my web browser.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.810
Then I'm going to go over to nodejs.org,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.505
and it will take you to the node J-s homepage.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.320
Node JS basically allows us to use JavaScript on

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.275
the server rather than only inside of the browser where it has been historically used.

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:51.380
It can be used to create a web server photos,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.235
but instead will blend in the view CLI handles this photos.

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:58.790
Node JS download also includes NPM.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.000
NPM is a Node package manager.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.040
We'll go over to npmjs.org.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.950
This is the website for the NPM package manager.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.490
This allows us to have access to thousands of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.725
JavaScript packages of code which we can add to our project.

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:27.215
Among the what's due in this project will be using packages such as web pack and bubble,

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:30.250
which we'll look at in more detail soon.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.740
Also we using Firebase for our photo storage,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.860
which has an NPM package to install.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.150
Even view itself is installed as a package.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.210
First let's go back over to Node JS,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.800
I'll begin the installation.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.320
I'm going to go over to the Downloads,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.840
and then if you choose a download for your particular system,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.085
if you're not sure which one to go for,

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:05.470
the homepage will usually automatically detect which system you're using,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.180
so we should have the correct download available.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.435
I'm going to install the latest version.

00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:14.890
I'm going to click on Currents.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.810
It gives a few seconds to download.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.600
Once that's done and just open up and install in the usual way.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.005
I'm using a Mac but it might be slightly different on Windows.

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:35.010
But you shouldn't have any problems.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.720
I'm just going to continue through and agree the licensing and then hit Install.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.750
Just give them a moment to finish off the installation.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.290
Then we'll have Node and NPM installed on our machine.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.480
Lets check this has been successfully installed,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.860
I'm going to head over to the terminal.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.590
I'm using a Mac for this course but if you're using a Windows machine,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.815
you will also have access to a command line program,

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.215
such as the Windows PowerShell.

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:17.705
Head over to that if you're using a Windows machine.

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:22.600
All the commands which we use in this course should be applicable to both.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.745
Lets make that a little bit bigger,

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:27.655
and when we check we have Node and NPM installed,

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:29.900
with some simple commands.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.335
First I'm going to type in Node and then

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:39.470
-v. If you see the version number display just underneath,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.785
that means that Node a successfully installed,

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:44.810
the same with NPM.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.310
NPM -v currently it's 5.0.3.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.505
If like me you have the version numbers displayed like this,

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:57.620
you've successfully installed Node and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.010
NPM and you are now ready to move on to the next video,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.840
where we'll look at the view CLI and how to use it to setup our project.
