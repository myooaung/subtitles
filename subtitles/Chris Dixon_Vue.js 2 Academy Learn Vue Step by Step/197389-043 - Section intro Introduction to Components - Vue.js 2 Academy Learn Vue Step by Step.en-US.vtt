00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
As our apps grow larger and more complex,

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:07.710
a setup like our guest list app may not be ideal.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.600
Our single app dot view file can quickly grow and become bloated,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.035
making it difficult to maintain and test.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:19.885
Using a setup like we have now, using Webpack,

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:24.585
we can now break up our code into smaller modules or components.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.045
This makes our file smaller,

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.400
easier to maintain and test,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.020
and also allows us to reuse components more than once.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.825
We have a lot to cover in this section,

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:40.240
so let's jump straight in to learning components.
