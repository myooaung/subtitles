00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.605
Now we know how to create and display single file components.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.965
We can now move on and really get our project moving.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:11.580
I'm going to go over to our project and organize

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.470
the components folder by adding a sub-folder called card.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.150
Then inside of this card folder,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.870
I'm going to create a new file called CardFront with the view extension.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.640
If you remember from the slides at the start of this section,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.630
we're going to have a single file component for each side of the card.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.520
It'll be the CardFront,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.325
CardBack, and both the inside, left and right.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:46.130
These components will act like rappers where you can drop in

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.985
the text and image components wherever we want them.

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:55.445
They're also the sections which will swap to change views when a menu link is clicked.

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:58.310
But more on that in a few videos though.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.695
Just change the spelling there.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:04.085
If we go back over to the CardFront.vue,

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:08.420
this is setup just like before with a template,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.200
so the opening and closing tags there,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.250
and then followed by the script tags and then finally the style tags.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.775
Inside of the template,

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:29.350
remember we'll need a surrounding div.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.405
Let's add this inside there.

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:40.590
You can also make this div a bootstrap row by adding the class of row inside there.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.280
Then we need to add some bootstrap columns,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.585
six on the left and also six on the right.

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:53.250
We'll create the left section to begin with.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.075
We can add the bootstrap classes of col sm 6.

00:02:03.075 --> 00:02:06.060
This will be half the width of the page.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.680
We'll also add a bootstrap class of card,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.730
and then a custom CSS class of edits area.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.285
We'll use this in just a moment to style the sections.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:24.185
Copy this left div and then paste it just below,

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:27.060
but still would inside this row.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.020
All we need to do is add our custom class this time of card display.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.260
Once you have that in place,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.470
we can go down to the style tags and then again,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.735
change these custom styles.

00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:47.855
Begin with the edits area,

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.815
which is a left-hand side of the card.

00:02:50.815 --> 00:02:54.520
We're going to give this a background color,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.740
a custom color of d2f9f9,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.755
and then also some padding of 20 pixels.

00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:13.635
Then to give the card some height,

00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:18.520
we'll add the CSS high property of 800 pixels.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.175
That's the editory on the left.

00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:26.795
The right hand side is the card display section.

00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:29.910
Let's add some styles for this section.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.050
All we're going to do here is match the height of 800 pixels,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.390
and then also keep the padding consistent with 20 pixels there.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.445
As always, this component will not display just yet.

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:52.775
For this to work, we need to register and also

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:56.170
import it inside of the file which you want to use it in.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.655
All of our components who are the children of App.vue,

00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:03.155
so we register and import it inside of there,

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:05.550
just like we did with the header.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.040
If you feel confident giving this a go,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.530
go ahead and pause the video and give this a go yourself.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.890
If you need a clue, just follow along with the same steps as

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.030
we did to register the Header.vue file.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.035
Otherwise, don't worry, and follow along with me.

00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:27.810
Inside the app.vue, let's go ahead and add the import statements.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.630
This time, we need to import the CardFront.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.555
However, this is a name up to us,

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:39.735
but I'm going to call it CardFront to keep it descriptive.

00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:44.885
CardFront from and then the file path is dot slash,

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.030
goes to the components folder.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.290
Remember, this time, we have the cards folder inside of the components.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.035
Be sure to add that in there.

00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:59.960
The name of the file is CardFront.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.470
With that registered, we can now scroll down and then add this to our components section.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.400
I'm going to call it the cardFront.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.145
Remember, this name is also optional for the one on the right of

00:05:18.145 --> 00:05:23.810
CardFront must match the import statement above.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.305
The last thing to do is to add this file inside of our template,

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:32.660
so just underneath the nav header.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.120
Let's add the card front components.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:55.880
This means that App.vue is a parent of both the header and also the card from components.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.640
This is all we need to do now to go over to

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.090
the browser and hopefully see our component displayed.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.140
We have the edits area on the left-hand side with the blue backgrounds.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.615
We also have the card display section on the right-hand side.

00:06:13.615 --> 00:06:15.420
If you don't see this running,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.880
and you just have a blank page,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.110
you may have an error, so check inside the console.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.815
You also may need to restart the development server.

00:06:23.815 --> 00:06:27.640
If you need to do that, I'm going to press Control C to close it

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.630
down and then run npm run dev,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.730
and then it should be back up and running.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.535
Finally, just to finish this section off,

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:48.070
I have a few basic styles to apply to the app inside of the App.vue file.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.785
Head back over to App.vue and scroll down to the style section.

00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:58.100
The first thing we want to do is add some styles to the body.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.650
I'm going to change the font family

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:11.925
to be Verdana Geneva,

00:07:11.925 --> 00:07:19.330
and then finally, a generic sans-serif as the fall back.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:26.830
Add a text color to be the value of 333.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.095
Then if we refresh, we should now see that the custom fonts have now taken effect.

00:07:35.095 --> 00:07:39.230
Then finally, I want to change these menu items into links.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.495
If we go over to the header,

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:43.270
and then inside of the list item,

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.125
we can just add our a-tags inside of there,

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:50.990
with a bootstrap class of nav link,

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.655
and then close off the a-tag.

00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:59.655
I'm just going to copy this,

00:07:59.655 --> 00:08:02.680
and paste it in front of the second,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.250
third, and fourth item.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.880
Do the same for the closing tag,

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:19.750
paste those in and save, and then refresh.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.740
Then we can change the cursor to be a pointer as it hovers over.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.320
The final styles is for the a-tags.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.860
This is going to be the cursor,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:41.730
this is going to be the type of pointer, and then save that.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.250
Now, we see if we go over the nav links,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.825
we now have the pointer.

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:48.460
Now that looks a little bit better.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.535
Hopefully, now you should be getting the hang of adding components.

00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:56.430
If not, don't worry, we still have plenty more to create for is app.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.585
We got a lot more practice as you go through the course.

00:08:59.585 --> 00:09:06.030
Next up, we'll take a look at how we can pass data from a child to a parent component.
