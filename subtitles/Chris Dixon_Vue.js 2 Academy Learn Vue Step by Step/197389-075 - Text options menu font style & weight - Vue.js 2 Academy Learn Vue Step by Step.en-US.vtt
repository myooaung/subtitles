00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.140
Now it's time to finish off our hover menu by adding

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.475
options to change the text to be both bold and italic.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.975
We can use the radio buttons like we've done in the last video,

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:18.720
because we want to be able to select both the bold and italic at the same time.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.755
Radio bonds only allow one of these we selected.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:26.700
Instead we can achieve this by using check boxes.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.080
Let's head over to the TextOutput.vue file.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
We can add these just below the text alignment section,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.730
which is just above the closing form tag.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.180
Let's start by creating our div.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.290
Let's add some classes to this surrounding div.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.820
The first class is going to be all form-check, and also form-check-inline.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.180
We can also add our label.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.730
I'm just going to add some classes to this of form-check-label,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.780
I'm going to add our input.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.750
Remember this is going to be the type of check box,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:36.630
and we'll also add some classes to make it look nice of form-check-inputs,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.665
and these all Boucher surfaces.

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:47.430
Just after the input we are going to add the name of bolds.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.550
This is a text which will appear right next to the checkbox.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.050
This is one for bold,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.365
we also need one for italic.

00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:59.170
Copy this full div,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.400
and then pace it in just below.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.820
We can use the same classes,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.630
form-check-inline for the input.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.280
This is also a checkbox,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.110
but with name of Italic.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.565
Checkboxes work a little bit differently to radio bonds.

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:27.170
Before with radio bonds,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.120
we set our data property with a particular value such as left or right.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.010
Checkboxes will return a Boolean value of true or false when checked or unchecked.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.755
If we go to our text which has the style object binded, which is just here.

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:53.075
We can use this true or false value sets or on-site a CSS class, which will bind.

00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:58.130
First one setup the date properties for bold, italic.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.085
Both these initially will be set to false.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:04.435
The text is standard to begin.

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.990
Go down to the data, and let's add a comma.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.960
The first one is what we called setBold with an initial value of false.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.405
Then add a comma at the end, and we can set,

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:27.930
setItalic also to the initial value of false.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.980
Then we can use the model to link this data with the checkboxes.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.380
Back up to the checkboxes.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.290
Let's add vue model to the input to setup two-way data binding.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.360
This first one is going to be the setBold data.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.345
Then of course, the second inputs for italic,

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:56.430
we'll set this to be setItalic.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.560
We can check if this data is changed when being tracked

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.595
by outputting the value within the curly braces.

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:14.060
Just after the its italic text,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.255
I'm going to set up the double curly braces.

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:21.165
The second one is set italic.

00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:24.700
I will do the same for setBold.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.555
Now had over the browser,

00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:33.175
and if you hover over our menu,

00:04:33.175 --> 00:04:35.300
we see an extra bold and italic,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.700
we have the initial values of false.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.400
First let's check bold.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.270
Good start changes to true and then back false and also the italic work too.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.105
That means the data property is being updated with vue model.

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:57.590
We can now see the check boxes are setting our data correctly.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.940
Start to move curly braces first of all,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.920
some of the setBold, and also setItalic.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.315
Then we can use this Boolean value to bind to our classes.

00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:15.230
Just like I mentioned before,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.090
if we go down to the P text,

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.740
which currently has the style bindings,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.670
we can also add a second attributes to bind the class.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.710
This is also going to be a object.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.075
Inside this object, we're going to add the first property of bold.

00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:44.510
This is going to be our data property of setBold and separated by a comma.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.985
We will also do the same for italic.

00:05:46.985 --> 00:05:52.380
This is our set dates property inside there.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.565
When set bold is true,

00:05:59.565 --> 00:06:01.635
you will apply the bold class.

00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:04.170
When set italic is set to true,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.525
it will set the italic class.

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:09.920
Now, we just need to set our bold and italic classes

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.820
inside of the CSS and then we should be done.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.400
Scroll down to styles.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.590
We'll start with the bold class.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:32.070
I want to do here is set the font-weight to be bold,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.490
and also the same for a italic,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.560
was at the form style this time to be italic.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.945
Save and then head over to the browser,

00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:51.090
and then hover over the menu.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.525
In fact, first, we'll add some text.

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:57.180
You can see the styles applied.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.980
Hover over the menu,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.270
and let's start with bold.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:10.050
Good. We can see the text is toggling between bold and standard. Let's try italic.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.240
Good, the styles are now applying into the text.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.015
If you open up the div tools,

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:26.610
we right-click and inspect and then select the output text. Now if check bold.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.785
We can now see that the class of bold has been applied inside the Developer Tools.

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:35.865
Let's do the same for italic,

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:37.610
and then we see the class of

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:43.100
bold and italic applying and once he is added as an attributes,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.290
these bold and italic styles then take effect.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.680
All that's left to do is add a little bit more styling.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.765
Mainly to make sure that once you hover over the menu,

00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:58.380
it doesn't push down this text if.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.710
We wanted to actually appear over the text

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.530
if rather than push it down as it probably does.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.710
Back over to the styles.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.370
I'm going to with the form.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.720
We're going to set the position to be absolute.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:30.450
We'll add a border just on

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:37.330
the bottom and I want to set this to be one pixel dotted and a gray color.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:45.060
I'm going to add some margin to the top of 10 pixels.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:51.940
A little bit to the bottom of five pixels,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.290
and then also some Padian just on the bottom.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.195
Also five pixels.

00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:05.130
Just keep us away from the edge.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.745
Just to finish this off,

00:09:07.745 --> 00:09:12.080
I'm going to add just some styling to the select box.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.765
All want to do is set the height to be 40 percent,

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:22.510
just to make it fits a little bit better. Give that a save.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.670
Now, let's see how does it look in the browser?

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.845
Good. Now when I hover over the menu,

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:32.450
we see that the text container is no longer pushed down.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.570
The menu now sits nicely on top of the div.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.040
I'm going to see how let's look on with some texts.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.760
Good that obviously working fine.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.205
Our hover menu is now complete.

00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:55.800
We can now move on to adding some finishing touches to our image components.
