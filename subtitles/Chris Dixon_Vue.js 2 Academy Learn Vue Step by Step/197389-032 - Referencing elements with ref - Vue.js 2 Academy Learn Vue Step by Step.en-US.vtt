00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.620
In the last video, we looked at some properties and

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
methods which are available to us in the Vue instance.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.120
One of these properties which can see is called refs.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.930
We can use refs register a reference to an element.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.005
We can place a ref on any element we want.

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.995
I'm going to go over to the index to HTML page.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:25.515
If we look for the page title,

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:30.130
I'm going to begin by removing a double curly braces.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.080
Then simply replacing this with guest list.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.595
Then in h1 opening tag,

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.415
I'm going to add a ref attribute.

00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:44.290
Answer is to a name.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.300
This is not a standard HTML attribute,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.100
it's provided to us by Vue.js.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.085
We also free to choose any ref name which will like.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.145
Now have this reference to the elements.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.855
We can work with it in our Vue instance.

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:05.720
I'm going to add a click handler to this level on heading,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.920
which you can hook up to this reference. I'd add click.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.390
I'm going to set this to be a method name of change title.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.125
All this element is not important,

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.225
we can still retrigger this method when it's clicked.

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:26.740
Then let's add our method in app.js.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.715
We need to add this in vm2.

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:35.550
Let's add our methods and we use a name or change title.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.080
We then select the ref with this title assign refs.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.140
Then from before the all of the native view properties have the dollar sign prefix.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.480
Then we add the name.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.585
Then dot in a text which is just JavaScript.

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:03.765
This is not something provided by Vue.js.

00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:07.425
Hopefully you can now begin to see the Vue.js and

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:11.899
normal vanilla JavaScript works together almost seamlessly.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:17.015
We can mix in JavaScript with Vue properties and methods where we need to.

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:21.170
Now if we save that and we go over to the browser,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.850
if we click the title,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.195
we should see the title is now being changed.

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:29.795
Along with using dollar sign refs to set data,

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.480
we can also access data using it.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.010
If we add a console log to show this dot dollar sign refs,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.125
we can see what it returned.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:48.460
Inside the change title method at a console log and this dollar sign refs.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.350
Then go over to the browser.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.350
We can see that an object is returned.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.105
We can also see that it's a h1 we have selected.

00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:04.250
If we open up this objects,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.955
we have access to all the associated data within it.

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.190
We can see the inner HTML which you've

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.590
reset and also all the other properties which we can access.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.495
For example, if we look at hidden,

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:20.840
we see there is set to false by default.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.350
We can use dollar sign refs accesses and change it inside of our method.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.500
Inside the changeTitle method,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.405
we can select this dot refs, dot name.

00:03:33.405 --> 00:03:39.125
Inside the method we can remove the inner text and replace this with dot hidden.

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:41.845
That we can set this to be true.

00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:45.140
Now if we save this and go back to our app,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.760
if we click on the title.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.870
Hidden is set to true,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.429
so the elements disappears.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.215
This is how we can use the dollar sign refs property

00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:58.115
to reference and elements and the set or access data.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:00.380
It's worth mentioning too that we can use

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.690
this refs property both inside and outside of the view instance tool.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.050
There is something to be aware of though when using refs,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.040
that is refs and not reactive.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.155
They're not created on the initial render.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:18.800
They are created as a result of the render function.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.365
We are changing the element in the DOM,

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:23.975
but not in the Vue.js template.

00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:27.860
Therefore, we changing something which may be overridden by

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.715
Vue.js at a later day whenever there is a re-render,

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:34.180
such as something to be careful of.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.570
However, using refs can be useful at times and maybe best used to get

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.980
data rather than set data because of the lack of reactivity.
