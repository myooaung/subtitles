00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.365
In the last video we successfully installed node.js and the node package manager.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:14.970
In this video, we're going to use a tool called the Vue CLI to scaffold out our projects.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.200
CLI stands for command line interface and it allows us to create

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.645
a new project with most of the common setup already taken care for us.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:29.760
JavaScript projects can get pretty complex when setting up all these build tools

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.980
ourselves along with all the NPM packages we often see.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.020
Let's go over to Google and we are going to search for the Vue CLI

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.270
and we need the first one which is the GitHub link for the Vue CLI.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.140
Select this and then we're taken to the official GitHub page.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.770
If we scroll down, first of all we can see

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.460
the installation but we will go for that in just a moment.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.270
If we go down to the official templates,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.340
we can see the current available templates which include the most complex ones which is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.255
a fully featured webpack version which includes

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:34.055
all the hot reloading and testing that we will commonly need for projects.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.980
There is a more simple version of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.885
this webpack 1 and we'll be using this for these project.

00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:44.100
If you prefer browserify over webpack,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.620
there is also a standard and a simple version for these two too.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.000
But I'm going to stick with webpack for the rest of this course.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.350
There is also a simple version which is

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.040
just a single HTML file which is more

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.585
like the guest list application that we created before.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:05.675
These templates save us a lot of time when creating new projects because

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:10.120
otherwise we would have to install and configure everything we need manually.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.970
For the next project we'll be using

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.930
the webpack simple template as we don't

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.865
need the more complex webpack setup with the testing.

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.500
To install this, let's go back over to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.440
the terminal and then we install

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.460
the Vue CLI with the node package manager and this is done

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.560
with NPM install and then dash

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.000
G to install this package globally and then the name of

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.250
the package is the Vue CLI and then hit ''Enter.''

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.320
If you're on a Mac and this does not work you may have to use the pseudo keyword before.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.045
This installs with the administrator privileges and you also need to add a password.

00:02:56.045 --> 00:03:01.240
Add pseudo NPM install dash G Vue CLI.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.265
Alternatively, if you want to change your privileges without using pseudo,

00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:09.665
I will also add a link at the end of this section.

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:12.890
This will allow you to configure your machine as the administrator

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.605
without needing to type in pseudo every time you install a new package.

00:03:17.605 --> 00:03:20.790
This installs the Vue CLI globally,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.810
so we can can use it for all our projects rather than it

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.080
only being available for the project which we're currently creating.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.610
Once that's installed, the last thing I want to do is to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.540
navigate to the area where we want to create the project.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.920
I'm going to add mine to the desktop.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.360
To get back to the home directory,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.355
we type in CD.

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:48.690
We use LS to display the contents of the current directory.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.785
We can see we have the desktop available,

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:57.210
so to change into this we can use CD again, followed by desktop.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.375
Then we can see we're now inside the desktop.

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:06.720
Now, when we setup the project it will be installed in this location.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.040
Now let's initialize the project inside the terminal.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.170
To set up a new Vue CLI project,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.355
we use Vue in it followed by the name of the template we want to use.

00:04:21.355 --> 00:04:24.680
I'm going to be using webpack simple.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.165
Then we give the project a name,

00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:32.390
so this name of this project is going to be creative cards.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.765
Once that's done hit ''Enter."

00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:40.500
Then once that's installed and once the template is downloaded,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.890
we'll then have to answer some simple set of questions.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.590
The first one is the name of the project.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.165
It's currently set to creative cards which we've already typed.

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:55.730
So if we want this we could just hit ''Enter.''

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.415
We can also add a project description but I'm just going to enter on for this.

00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:04.790
Add the name of the author,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.090
so I add my name in there. Use SASS?

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.765
I'm not going to use any SASS for these projects,

00:05:12.765 --> 00:05:14.685
so I'm going to hit ''Enter.''

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:17.470
As you can see it's already set to no.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.715
Now it gives us a list of the steps we need to take just to finish this off.

00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:25.760
First of all, we need to CD to change

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.630
the directory into the creative cards project which we just setup.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.210
I will hit ''Enter.'' Once you've done that the next step is to run NPM

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:47.380
install and this downloads all of the NPM packages which are required.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.330
All these packages are listed inside of a file called the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.450
package.json and we will explore the contents of this file soon.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.110
This may take a little bit of time depending on how many NPM modules you have.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.750
The final step is NPM run dev and this

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.105
is to run the development server inside of the browser.

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:17.335
I'm not going to run this just yet because I'm going to

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.950
run this inside of Visual Studio code.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.340
Let's just close these Windows down and we should now see

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.460
that our creative cards project is now on the desktop.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.505
I'm going to open this up inside a Visual Studio,

00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:40.340
so let's open that and then drag over the creative cards projects into that.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.615
Then now if we go over to view and then go down to the integrated terminal,

00:06:48.615 --> 00:06:51.890
we can then start our development server.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.515
NPM run dev and then hit ''Enter.''

00:06:57.515 --> 00:07:07.150
Then hopefully this should open up in the browser and should take a moment to open up.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.240
If you see this then we're good to go.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.045
Our development server is now setup.

00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:18.975
Over in the terminal we can see where the project is running,

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:23.210
so we can see this is running at port 8080.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.940
You may need to copy this link and paste it in

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.700
the browser if it doesn't open up automatically.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:36.230
A development server is not always required but it makes sense to use one as it

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:42.250
allows us to create our app and testing conditions similar to a real server environment.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.490
It also has additional benefits such as live reloading.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:52.240
The browser will update changes without us needing to refresh the page.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.495
Now we have the project created and our web server up and running.

00:07:56.495 --> 00:08:03.000
Let's explore these files and folders which have been provided to us with the Vue CLI.
