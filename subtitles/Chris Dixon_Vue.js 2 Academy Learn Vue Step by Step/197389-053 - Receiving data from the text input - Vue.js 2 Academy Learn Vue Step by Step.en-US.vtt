00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.589
In the last video, we successfully created and registered our new text input components.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.900
Now we're going to continue by adding

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.115
this component to the front of the card two more times.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:22.140
Let's go over to the card front door view and here where we created the CC text inputs,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.210
let's copy this and paste it in two more times.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.170
You should be seeing a bit of a pattern in my [inaudible]

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.235
to display the components we add it like HTML elements.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.745
All we need to do is add this three times,

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:44.860
and then you can see we how they displayed three times inside the front of the card.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.035
Now we have our three components,

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:55.075
we also need to add the event listener which we added inside of the text input.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:01:00.740
We're currently emitting the event called Display Text Changed.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.140
From [inaudible] to this inside of the components using @ display text

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:15.080
changed and then we also need to add this to our second and third components.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.440
Just copy and paste those over.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.420
Here we have three components added which all listen for

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.695
the display text change event to be passed to it.

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:31.340
We now need to add free data properties to store

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.275
the text value received so that's one for each components.

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:40.930
Let's go down to our script and we can add our data property.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:50.550
The first one we want to add

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:01.080
is going to be a name of text-box value 1 which is going to be initially an empty string.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.550
Because you got three separate components,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.730
I'm also going to add the same for number 2 and 3.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.165
Text-box value 2, again set to be

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:21.300
an empty string for now and then text-box value 3.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.370
With this now in place, we can now update them with

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.750
the value of the events passed from the [inaudible] components.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.345
We'll do this just as we looked at previously inside of the event listener.

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:41.510
We can begin by adding text-box value

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.785
1 into the first component and certainly is equal to

00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:49.900
the value of the event

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.730
and then we do exactly the same for the second and third components.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.590
Text-box value 2 and then text-box 3.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.280
With this now in place,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.280
all we need to do is check if the data is being received from each of our components,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.880
is to simply output values using the text interpolation.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:25.060
Let's begin by outputting a text-box value 1 and then text-box value 2,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.020
then the same for value 3, save that.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.590
Make sure that the development server is up and

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.900
running and then if we go over to the browser.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.275
Now if we start by adding some text into the first one,

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:46.770
we can see that the text is displayed down at the bottom,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.730
that's our text area 2.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.850
Now we have text area 2 displayed also.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.035
Let's try the third one.

00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:04.755
Text area 3 is also appearing there too.

00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:11.500
We can now see that we've got three of the same components displayed on the screen.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.475
Now we'll reuse our component three times.

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:17.685
However, the data is stored independently

00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:22.645
so each when we type in has their own corresponding data value.

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:26.525
If you manage to get this all working, congratulations.

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:28.340
You should be getting the hang of components

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.895
now and you are now ready to move on to the next video.

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:35.670
We'll begin to create the text output areas.
