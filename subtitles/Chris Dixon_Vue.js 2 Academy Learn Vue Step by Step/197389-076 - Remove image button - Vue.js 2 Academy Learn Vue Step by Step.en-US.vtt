00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
In the next few videos,

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:06.975
I'm going to add some extra functionality to finish off our image components.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.990
To begin, I want to add a button which appears when the user

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.980
hovers over the image to allow the image to be removed.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.590
Once you move this, we'll set a default placeholder image onto the card.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.820
Go over to the image output.vue file.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.355
We can add a button with some bootstrap styling.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:33.070
Just after the initial opening div,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.920
I'm going to add a button inside of here with the text of remove image.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.000
Then inside the opening button tag,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.219
going to add some attributes,

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.250
will begin with the type and set this will be button.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.355
Then some bootstrap classes to apply some styling.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:05.950
First of all, BTN then BTN outline

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.320
danger and this adds a red border to the button.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.715
Then finally BTN-SM, to make the button a little bit smaller.

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:22.765
Also, just like the text options,

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:25.340
I'm going to add visual,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.780
to only show the menu on hover.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.155
Inside here, I'm going to create a date option called

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:42.740
show options and then let's go down to our view instance and create this.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.640
Just underneath the props,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.680
we can add our data section.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.910
Don't forget to add the coma just afterwards.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.715
Then we can return our data.

00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:02.275
The data property we created was called

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:09.560
show options and that's initially sets show options to be false.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.700
Then we can set this to true once the user hovers over the image.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.820
We do this by adding some mouse events.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.155
Let's go back up to the template and add a mouseover,

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:25.280
a mouse leave events.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.945
I am going to add this in the opening div,

00:02:27.945 --> 00:02:35.920
just after the binded style object.. We'll begin with mouseover.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.745
When the user adds the mouse over the surrounding image, div,

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:44.920
we'll then set show options to be

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.840
true and this will then trigger V Show and enable button to display.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.410
We'll then add mouse leave through the opposite

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.710
once the mouse is moved away from the image container.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.550
This time the show options is set to false.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.840
So say that and we can test this works okay in the browser.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.990
Now move the mouse over the image section and we see the button has displayed.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.725
Then if we move the mouse away,

00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:25.910
the button is unremoved.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.065
Finally, to make sure that the button sits on top of the image rather than behind it.

00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:35.390
We can also set up some CSS.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.155
So back over to the image upper file.

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:43.340
We can do this down in the style section at the bottom.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.680
We can add some styles to the button.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.645
First of all, we'll set the position to be

00:03:52.645 --> 00:04:02.050
absolute and then the Z index to be a value of one,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.330
to enable the button to sit on top of the image.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.035
Same, lets just check this in the browser.

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:15.875
That still looks okay. With our button now in place,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:19.700
we can use it in the next video to remove the image.
