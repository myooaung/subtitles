1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,390
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:09,450
So in this series of learning how to make projects in Java today, we are going to learn how to make

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,320
a download manager that in Java.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,910
So on your screens you can see the title of the project and an image attached to it.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,990
So the title of this project says My Download Manager.

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:36,660
So by holding that title, I hope you have gained a like overview about what actually we are going to

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,620
make today.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:47,790
So we are going to make our download manager by writing code in our IDE and the download manager is

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:55,620
going to be based upon Java language and no other frameworks we are going to use while making this.

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,870
The download manager is going to be made simply in core Java.

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,320
So the image on your screen screens?

12
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,790
Yes.

13
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:14,160
So this is the interface which is going to like open when you paste any link and click on the download

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,820
button.

15
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,910
Initially there will be nothing here.

16
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,460
Currently we are having two links pasted and the download is taking place.

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,890
But initially there will be nothing.

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,230
Just you have to like paste.

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,120
This is the input text field.

20
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:39,030
You have to like paste the link off like step controlling should be pasted in this input text field

21
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,870
and then you have to click on the download button in order to make the download start.

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:53,580
So this is the frame which is made using frameworks, toolkits of Java.

23
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:03,000
We call it a w t string and we are going to use that to frameworks only while making this project.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,200
So this is the title of the frame like this title says Fine.

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,990
So this is the title bar of the frame there.

26
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:22,380
In the second part, we are having our input text field and a button also in the main table for we have

27
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,230
basically a table format which is having several rows and columns.

28
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:36,780
The rules are going to contain the links which we are like wishing to download and the columns contains

29
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:44,790
details about the download which is taking place like the details of each specific link.

30
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,930
The details says like This is the one l column, this is the size column.

31
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,500
The size is going to be displayed in megabytes.

32
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,850
We call it MVP.

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,940
So the size is going to be displayed of that file in megabytes.

34
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:14,160
So we have currently two files, one with with 13.8 MP and the second one is 44.39 and so on.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,010
And these so the third column is like important column.

36
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:29,520
We can see that it is showing that how much the download is completed like we have a progress but which

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,100
is showing the progress in percentage.

38
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:43,530
So once the download is started, the progress bar started from the 0% and upon the time when the download

39
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,900
is completed, it shows 100% like completed status.

40
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,230
So basically these all columns are linked in a way.

41
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:04,800
Suppose that the size is going to remain the same and you are going to remain same, but all the columns

42
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,970
are going to like vary depending upon each other.

43
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:16,380
So the progress, if increases then the status will like.

44
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,480
When the download started, the status bar will show that downloading.

45
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:30,180
Once the download is completed, the status bar will show completed or if any error like arrives.

46
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:37,890
So it is going to show that status like status of this download is showing some error.

47
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,460
So error will be displayed in this status bar.

48
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,890
Also, yes, we have pause and resume option.

49
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:56,040
We are like having separate buttons for pausing, resuming, cancelling and clearing us like individual

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,700
columns.

51
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,940
We have to select that column and then.

52
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:07,920
In order to play pause, cancel the download or clear the like row from the table.

53
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,110
So we are having buttons for that also.

54
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,670
Now I was talking about that these are linked.

55
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:24,280
So suppose that initially the download started from 0%, then the remaining time is going to be like

56
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,800
suppose it is taking 2 minutes.

57
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,750
So that time will be like displayed here that 2 minutes and elapsed time is going to like display zero.

58
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,230
Like initially we have no elapsed time.

59
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,360
Just the remaining time will be shown.

60
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,710
Once the progress bar increases its percent, then elapsed time is going to increase and remaining time

61
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,800
is going to like decrease and they are like a link to each other.

62
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:01,600
The elapsed time will increase exponentially and the remaining time will decrease in that manner only

63
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,550
also the average speed.

64
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,130
So it is totally dependent upon your bandwidth of your network.

65
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:19,330
Like suppose you are having a good bandwidth like so the average speed will be shown good and if the

66
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:27,610
network is like the bandwidth will be low and the speed speed is showing here in kilobytes.

67
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,490
Also we have our speed column and the average speed column.

68
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:44,320
So speed column is the speed at that point of time and the average speed is the speed like the total

69
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,940
progress divided by the total time elapsed.

70
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,710
So speed is like the total size divided by the time.

71
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,410
So what is the average speed till now is this block showing?

72
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:08,020
So this column is for average speed calculation and this is for the speed calculation of that instant

73
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,590
only.

74
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,120
So OC.

75
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,440
So in the next part.

76
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:21,230
Okay, so in this we have a complete download like this link is pasted and the download is completed.

77
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:31,410
So these buttons are automatically like disabled themselves as we have no selected columns and the download

78
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,750
is completed so there is no point of pausing resuming the download.

79
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,120
Okay.

80
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:46,590
So here we have pasted the link and the add download button highlights up on clicking this add download

81
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,280
button.

82
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,860
This download is going to start so we have this download completed.

83
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,600
The size was five MP.

84
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:01,260
The progress bar is showing hundred percent complete, so the status is showing so the remaining time

85
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,820
is zero.

86
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,560
Like we have no remaining time.

87
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,630
The download is already completed and the elapsed time is 16 seconds.

88
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:15,930
So now you can also like here like calculate what is the total time.

89
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,650
So in this download so everything it is a complete package.

90
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,630
So this download manager is a complete package of everything.

91
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,880
We have a progress bar, we have a speed, we have average speed.

92
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,560
We have elapsed and remaining time and the status of course.

93
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:47,430
So yes, this is the like us another window of the download manager which is showing our complete download.

94
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,860
Now in the next part we are going to like discuss the specifications.

95
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:02,460
So the specifications of this project is this is basically a download manager and we are creating this

96
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,690
with the help of Java.

97
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,540
So it is a software tool that is managing downloading files from internet.

98
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,480
So we are like taking links from somewhere and then pasting it to her.

99
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,030
So the everything is on the web.

100
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:25,140
We are just like taking the link and pasting it and then the download is starting.

101
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:34,560
So okay, so this download manager is just a tool of downloading things from the web to your specific

102
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,400
system on which the download manager is running now.

103
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,460
For after the download you can then share those files and things become portable.

104
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:50,760
When you download, then you can share anything with external drives also.

105
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,030
So that download size could be anything.

106
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:02,940
This is going to download everything and it is using its connection for downloading files.

107
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,750
So the step like the links containing as database connection, are to be pasted here in order to download

108
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,620
the files.

109
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:21,760
So the features of this download manager, we have already discussed that we can pause the downloads,

110
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,200
resume the downloads according to our convenience.

111
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,370
Like suppose that we want to pause the download at present.

112
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,740
We have to like go somewhere.

113
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:38,700
Then we can pause and then again come back and resume that download according to our convenience.

114
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,190
Also we can cancel then download in the middle of the program process.

115
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:52,230
Suppose that we have mistakenly started downloading the wrong side, so it is not like necessary to

116
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,210
wait for the download to complete.

117
00:10:54,210 --> 00:11:04,410
We can cancel it any time in order to stop the download and this is of course a graphical user interface

118
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,570
application made in Java.

119
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,970
So it is a text window interface application.

120
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,690
You can run this application on your desktops by creating a separate icon.

121
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,340
It is simply going to act like any other download manager.

122
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,830
You can open this download manager, trace the link and then start the download of your files.

123
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,230
And we are creating this user interface with the swing controls.

124
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,360
So swing is a framework of Java that we are going to study about.

125
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:46,740
So in the next part we will be discussing that what are actually the concepts we are going to learn

126
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,510
while making this project?

127
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,640
Before making any project?

128
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,870
It comes in our minds that what actually I am going to learn after the successful completion of this

129
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,530
project.

130
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:08,010
So after this successful completion of the project, we will be having a good grasp on object oriented

131
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,040
programming in Java as we are going to.

132
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,460
I can use the object oriented programming very deeply in this project.

133
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,170
Everything will be around classes and objects and methods.

134
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:29,450
We will be like declaring classes or declaring functions, accessing methods and objects with keywords

135
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,730
and so on.

136
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:39,640
And also we are going to use the string and frameworks of Java in a very extensive manner.

137
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:47,840
So everything is going to be like a conveyor with the help of string and frameworks.

138
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:58,530
So we are going to use components of swing and AWP framework such as the GE Frame, Japan, GM, Menubar

139
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:07,470
Item, Jay Button, and so many more like components of swing library we are going to use while making

140
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,520
this project.

141
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,700
Also, this application is made in core Java.

142
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,950
We have not used any complex like built tools instead of core Java.

143
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:26,830
So yes, this is going to be a core Java application made from scratch on yourself.

144
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,670
So functionalities of a download Managing App.

145
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:38,940
We are also going to learn how each of the functionality works, how we can play, how we can pause

146
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:48,240
the downloading, how we can clear the specific column, how we can like cancel our specific download

147
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,350
from the middle, how the connection works.

148
00:13:52,680 --> 00:14:00,210
Like everything we are going to learn about this download Managing Application and of course Class and

149
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,750
object are a part of object oriented programming in Java.

150
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:09,450
So obviously we are going to learn handling classes and objects in Java.

151
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:16,600
So I hope you all must be excited about making this project on your own.

152
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:25,060
