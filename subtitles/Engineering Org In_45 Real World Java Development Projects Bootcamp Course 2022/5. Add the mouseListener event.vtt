00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.010
Look at the previous video.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.700
We have done one wrong thing here.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.670
I have put the I and here I so change it to the one and simply run our program

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.410
and I'm here.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.510
We are getting no error, simply getting this output.

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.040
So now go to the class and not here.

7
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.600
What we have to do, we have to get component.

8
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.890
From G panels.

9
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.270
The component which we have created, the component one and the component to.

10
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.050
Go to the.

11
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.300
Good to hear.

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.790
In constructor and dried component one will do cheap panel.

13
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.420
No, you panel do not get components.

14
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.970
Component two equals two

15
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.690
g panel.

16
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.800
Dubai to get components.

17
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.210
So here we get our components.

18
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.290
Know what we have to do.

19
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.770
We have to function.

20
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.680
And so the next thing which we have created a function to add action to G labels when we click.

21
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.820
So we have to write the body and we need that component here.

22
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.210
So what we will do, we need a for loop.

23
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.700
And here we write.

24
00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.870
We will use the for each loop so we will light popcorn colon one.

25
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.710
We check if an instance of.

26
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.150
Julie.

27
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.900
Note this condition.

28
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.870
We have to.

29
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.690
Okay.

30
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.480
So we will write her.

31
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.480
She will.

32
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.440
Drilling boom boom to

33
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.720
level one right here and done.

34
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.000
And then we don't.

35
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.830
And we need the mouse listener here.

36
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.650
So we need a mouse listener.

37
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.510
And right new.

38
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.570
We need all.

39
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.500
In the abstract we know toolkit.

40
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.540
So what we have to write.

41
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.160
We need even.

42
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.840
He went to a platform.

43
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:27.220
Okay, so what do you have to write even though we need the mouse adapter?

44
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.300
Okay, so we need this mouse adapter

45
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.600
here.

46
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.800
We will write.

47
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.690
Who will write

48
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.380
me the mouse click.

49
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.440
Clint, who even tried.

50
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.350
Gentlemen, don't distract me.

51
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.210
And we need the mouse even here.

52
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.090
I need to see

53
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.870
that body.

54
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.830
We?

55
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.770
Right.

56
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.910
Thank.

57
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.910
Okay.

58
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.660
So tell me how to set up color.

59
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.400
So what we will do, we will try it.

60
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:38.240
We will load, set the background and set the color to my default.

61
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.580
Set it to the right here.

62
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.060
And then.

63
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.200
Know what we have to do before this.

64
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.470
We have done the chip.

65
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.560
No, we have done.

66
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.400
We have done the cheap one part here.

67
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.370
No.

68
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.440
This one is the cheap to.

69
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.730
Okay.

70
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:17.270
So simply what we have to do, we have to do this thing for a living.

71
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.780
And again, for another panel here.

72
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:29.150
So this is for the G panel to simply copy this.

73
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.280
Simply paste this.

74
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.580
And here we would like to panel three.

75
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.860
And simply what we need to do.

76
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.070
We have to change.

77
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.880
Key.

78
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.400
Listen.

79
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.720
We are waiting to hear.

80
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.870
This part is done here.

81
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.030
And we have function this election.

82
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:14.480
And so here everything is done after our nominee checks.

83
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.410
What do we have to do next?

84
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.000
We have to add action to the labels.

85
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.890
So addiction to labels.

86
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.030
So.

87
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.800
And action simply done.

88
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.150
So here, the part of action is done.
