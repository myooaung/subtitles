1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,750
And see.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,120
We have checked.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,360
We have checked that.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,720
And also, if you did not put or give the input to the text field, so we have to show a message.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,970
So here we have, right?

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,800
You must like both countries and must input amount and it will be an error message.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,940
So here we have tried the text first country and get the text if it is null and the text second country

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,380
read also done.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,400
So we will show the message dialog here and simply what we will do.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,440
We will check this thing and run the our program here.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,890
So here if the user select Brazil and suppose you but do not give any input here so simply click on

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,790
convert here we get our error message information message.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,400
You must like both countries and must out.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,010
So what we will do, we will try 23 and simply write convert.

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,250
We started.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,910
They shouldn't even be on Syria.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,340
So we should remove this.

18
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,130
We simply run this.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,790
So.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,240
Notice we look at it and simply no input.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,540
So you must select an input.

22
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:43,310
So here we will write 34 and convert and record our answer and simply click Reset.

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,870
All things are reset here.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,720
Suppose let's choose India to Nigeria.

25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,900
We write 45 and we call our answer convert and simply click on exit.

26
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,090
So this is all our project.
