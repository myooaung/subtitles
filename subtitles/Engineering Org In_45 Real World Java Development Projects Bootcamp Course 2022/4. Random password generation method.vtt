1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:09.480
So in the previous part, what we learned is about creating constructor and creating two methods.

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.420
We created already two methods generating said department.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.860
Now.

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.350
Let us see what we are going to move further.

5
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.940
So for this, I'm going to explain.

6
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.020
Oh.

7
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.400
We can create random password here to generate.

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.690
Random password.

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.590
Mitt.

10
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.260
I'm going to put your name as like that.

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.060
Then again, Private.

12
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.570
Or I'm considering your string only.

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.780
Generate.

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.800
Password.

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.730
No.

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.760
What I'm going to do.

17
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:04.950
I'm going to put here some parameter integer length, because I want to specify the length of that password.

18
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.150
Lend.

19
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.640
Then I will create one exciting material.

20
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.560
It is random.

21
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.240
So if you know there is one in Java until there is a class called random, which I already know, it

22
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.630
will be helpful to create some random thing inside Java.

23
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.270
You can print any random number using this or you can generate any random string.

24
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.500
So first I'm going to put your string.

25
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.360
Capital characters can be.

26
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.790
Capital characters because we want to create some set of capital characters here.

27
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.100
So A to Z, capital A to Z, A, B, C like that.

28
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.670
So that's it.

29
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.640
We are done with capital letters.

30
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.570
No.

31
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.760
Or we will put similarly small letters.

32
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.980
So I'm pressing your control.

33
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.230
Just control the output.

34
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.760
Copy that part.

35
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.010
And small characters.

36
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.350
And I'm going to put all small.

37
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.950
So we are done with small characters.

38
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.580
Now I want to put numbers because there are numbers also in passwords, phone numbers.

39
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.860
Is equal to.

40
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.020
029.

41
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.030
Now some symbols.

42
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.550
So what I'm doing, I'm creating some sets, as you can see, of the strings.

43
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.520
Like these are strings only, but for symbolic set capital letters, characters, small character sets

44
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.480
for the symbols.

45
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.970
I'm considering all the symbols.

46
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.910
Like explanation added hashtag then dollar symbol per cent and symbol.

47
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.350
And again, question mark.

48
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.020
Question mark is also the question mark.

49
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.750
Then value.

50
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.930
Value is basically just what is the what we can say syntax of over this.

51
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.850
So what it will be considering here is all capital characters plus all small characters.

52
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.420
It's small characters.

53
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.340
Small birds.

54
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.370
Loss numbers, loss symbols.

55
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.150
So we are done with what is the syntax of our.

56
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.280
It will include capital, small characters, numbers, symbols.

57
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.910
These are the four of the system default passwords.

58
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.980
These for system default password.

59
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.210
Now let's move with further how we can generate some random.

60
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.130
First, create string for password.

61
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.200
Would you return to the null?

62
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.880
Because first time it is null.

63
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.250
Then it will append some password here.

64
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.810
Then for for use for loop integer i instant variable again to loop it.

65
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.080
I slash length length.

66
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.220
I use your length.

67
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.270
I plus plus simple for loop now.

68
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.920
Use this password is equal to password.

69
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.240
What it will do.

70
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.220
It will put that values characters at.

71
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.490
Index.

72
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.540
Then.

73
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.680
Ah, now remember, what is the ah ah is for that random method it will choose any random thing from

74
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.360
that all the sets and it will put inside this so random dot next int, next int.

75
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.620
Because for this it will choose next int then.

76
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.560
Or inside this next st values dot.

77
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.470
Lent because it will stop at that length, but also.

78
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.060
And it includes return.

79
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.820
Password.

80
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.310
So what it will be do the significance of this is this will take this from.

81
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:06.510
This all sets now password will assign with password plus what is at that values character at correct

82
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.690
which character is one random next?

83
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.640
It will choose random from this.

84
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.160
Also the random position of that password values dot length.

85
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.810
In that length it will put that password.

86
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:27.300
So now I'm not giving the fixed length for this, but for that purpose it will choose the simple length

87
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.720
here.

88
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.650
As I mentioned here, we will see in the next part.

89
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.180
So this is for the random password generating random password method.

90
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.910
Now I want to create the specific which is change password method.

91
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.160
Change password method.

92
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.700
Now in changed password method.

93
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.410
I want to set it to public now.

94
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.890
Why will you tell that it should be public?

95
00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.380
You are all creating that private part and this is only public.

96
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.030
While so change password is for user, not for the system.

97
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.100
User will change that password.

98
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:13.580
Again, I'm going to use some private strings here, but it should be public for the user.

99
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.860
Significance.

100
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.210
So set password again.

101
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:23.670
This is I'm going to set to the void return type word because it will return nothing.

102
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.800
It will just print.

103
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.260
Now I want to create some loop here.

104
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:38.130
The thing is, before like set password, you know, do you want to choose or change your password and

105
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.640
press y?

106
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.000
And then similarly like that I want to create your condition.

107
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.800
Boolean leg.

108
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.180
Is equal to false.

109
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.790
Similarly we created for that same department similarly for this also.

110
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.370
Then do loop your Dubai loop system.

111
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.070
Lord in.

112
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.500
Do you want to?

113
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.220
Change your password.

114
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.700
That part.

115
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.760
Why Slash and why Slash and.

116
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.390
So much in.

117
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.130
So it will ask for a user.

118
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.100
Now let us see.

119
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.930
What is we can do is care.

120
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:31.960
Joycelyn.

121
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.510
I'm creating character here.

122
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.790
Remember, this is.

123
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.130
These are the end for that department.

124
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:37.800
It isn't.

125
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.510
Now I'm creating for the character.

126
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.690
Character choice is equal to is not.

127
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.300
Next for the character is for that scan.

128
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.560
The room scanner is dot next.

129
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:57.070
Now what it will do if a user is putting yes or something like that, then it will return some error

130
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.630
to avoid that error.

131
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.630
What I can do.

132
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.360
Just choose the first character.

133
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.710
So what I can do is.

134
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:08.820
Is dot next dot character at zero zero index without index in.

135
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.370
We all know about a restaurant form zero.

136
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.110
Similarly, that character starts ordering start from zero.

137
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.610
So character at zero.

138
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.180
Then if.

139
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.710
Choice.

140
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.940
Choice is equal to is equal to Y.

141
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.800
Or I can say if choice.

142
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.590
Is equal to is equal to small white.

143
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.310
Our condition.

144
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.990
I just put our condition here.

145
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.160
Small way.

146
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.500
What it will be do is it's like it's true once flag is true.

147
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.230
It will stop that part.

148
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.860
Also do y.

149
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.620
So I'm just putting flags equal to two here.

150
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.860
Enter current password, so it shouldn't be asked for current password.

151
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.880
Also, it will not match.

152
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.190
It will do the that new password and all things.

153
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.190
So enter current password.

154
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:31.660
So this is one of the what we can say is most our biggest part of our project Safe Password.

155
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.550
Then string.

156
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.680
I'm going to create some temporary variable.

157
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.850
To assign that and bring.

158
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.300
That part and pudding next for the user.

159
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.480
Again, if if it's equal to that that password.

160
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.810
Theme.

161
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.030
Dot.

162
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.810
Sorry.

163
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.290
Yes.

164
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.550
Dot equals.

165
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.000
This not password.

166
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.590
Or it will be us.

167
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.940
It will ask about a new password system.

168
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.850
Not don't bring talent.

169
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.630
Under New.

170
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:19.430
Password.

171
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.070
And once this is entered.

172
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.240
What it can do is this distort.

173
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.760
Password.

174
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.420
It will just append to this.

175
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.810
It's not next.

176
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.490
It will happen to that part.

177
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.330
And it will bring sunscreen, dot, dot, Ritalin.

178
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.240
Password.

179
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.610
Changed.

180
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.040
The 50.

181
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.290
We will change the password successfully.

182
00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.190
Password change?

183
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:06.130
Now, if password is wrong, if your password is wrong, this is wrong.

184
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.080
So else.

185
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.400
Or it will be put.

186
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.210
Incorrect password.

187
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.150
Steam dot dot.

188
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.290
Printed in.

189
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.210
Incorrect.

190
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:19.610
Fast forward.

191
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:33.040
Now, if what if the choice is not this or that purpose, I'm going to create another thing.

192
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:38.110
ElseIf You know that LC is another in the letter.

193
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.440
Like that I will create.

194
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.190
You're also.

195
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.340
Wait a minute.

196
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.840
Where is that?

197
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.290
Okay.

198
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.750
Okay, okay.

199
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.010
Okay.

200
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:53.960
So what is wrong?

201
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.790
Thing is I did is ls it will should start from own.

202
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.220
ElseIf.

203
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.930
Choice.

204
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.180
Is equal to is equal to.

205
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.330
And our.

206
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.980
Chance.

207
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.540
Is equal to, is equal to and small in.

208
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.690
You just like is equal to.

209
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.210
Or through.

210
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.800
To remove from that loop part.

211
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.310
I will bring in dot dot intel and.

212
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.400
Password.

213
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.350
And.

214
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.150
Option.

215
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.780
Cancel.

216
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.690
That's it.

217
00:13:59.160 --> 00:13:59.910
No.

218
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.210
I will create some default thing here like else.

219
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.310
Enter system.

220
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.640
Dot.

221
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.870
Dot, dot.

222
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.650
Println.

223
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.810
Like interview choice or something.

224
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.660
And after this, I will end with similar condition like flag.

225
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:31.980
And that's it.

226
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.200
Now we are done with our set person.

227
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.950
This is the biggest part, as you know, in this.

228
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.480
So what I did is.

229
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.940
I created here.

230
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.830
Password method.

231
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.520
Public void said password.

232
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.600
Boolean flag is equal to false with the do by loop.

233
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.930
I first put that.

234
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.550
Do you want to change your password?

235
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:57.540
Yes or no?

236
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.360
Then I will enter from the user.

237
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.760
I will ask for user to press wire.

238
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.460
And if the user presses y.

239
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:12.690
It will change that password, but before that it will ask for a current password.

240
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:20.920
If that current password matches with that old password like you are putting, it will proceed with

241
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.640
the new password.

242
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.840
If not, it will give the incorrect.

243
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.130
And if you are pressing in, then it will.

244
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.570
That option will be cancelled.

245
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:34.870
Or else if you are putting some different like y other than y or in or something, it will ask for enter

246
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.610
validators.

247
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.430
And then I'm executing that loop, exiting that loop.

248
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:46.450
So similarly for that, I'm going to create some set about mailbox capacity, then for alternate mail,

249
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.690
then displaying the information of the user, then store the file and every method.

250
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.000
So that's it.
