00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.830
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:09.060
So I hope that you all have went through the introduction video and the working of the application video

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:17.670
part pretty well and must be excited about how to start the coding execution of the application in the

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.480
compiler.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.960
So this is the welcome window of our favorite compiler, Visual Studio code.

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.310
And inside the welcome page of our IDE, we have to like start creating a new project from scratch.

7
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:40.170
So in order to do so, we will be like initializing our project by selecting our location for the folder

8
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
and then making classes inside the for us folder.

9
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.950
We will like see what happens.

10
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.500
Let us first create a new project.

11
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.690
So in order to do so, we have to click on this Explorer button on the sidebar of the welcome page.

12
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.170
So on clicking this like option tabs or pens asking for what actually we want to do.

13
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.600
So we have to create a Java project, so we have to click on this create Java project option from the

14
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.700
sidebar or like on Clicking Explorer, then click create our project like a dialog box thing appears

15
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.650
asking for which will be required for making this project.

16
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:34.830
There are several build tools in Java such as Maven, Springboard Micro Profile, but in this project

17
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.180
we are like directly going to work with the source code without any external attachment of build tools.

18
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.260
We are like making this project from scratch and we have already discussed this in the introduction

19
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.760
part that this is a core Java application tutorial.

20
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.070
So yes, we are going to make this project with core Java.

21
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.710
No external build tools like know any template kind of things we are going to use.

22
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.320
So yes, on clicking no build tools are like a file chooser off your system opens asking for a project

23
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.540
location where you want to keep your like story or project in your system.

24
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.220
So choose a location where you want to store.

25
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.700
I am choosing this desktop folder as the project location for my application, so this is like a dialog

26
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.390
box asking for input java project name.

27
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:46.950
So we have to choose our like good name for our project which signifies that what actually this like

28
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.090
a project does.

29
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.190
So I am naming it as my download manager.

30
00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.990
So this is going to be the name of the folder which is going to be created inside which there will be

31
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.370
some inbuilt folders.

32
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.510
We will see that.

33
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.880
So after like selecting the name, you can choose any name of your choice, but choose our name wisely,

34
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.610
which signifies that what actually is the consequence of that specific project?

35
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:27.120
So yes, my download manager on hitting Enter, we will end up in the welcome page of our this project

36
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.780
folder.

37
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.400
So I have already told you that it is going to contain some inbuilt folder.

38
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.540
So dot disk and dot vs code are the inbuilt folders due to the mercy of our compiler.

39
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.500
They are completely of no use in our project.

40
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.910
So ignoring these to invert folders like focusing on what actually is important for our project.

41
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.610
So this Z folder is the body of our project.

42
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.200
Inside this part of the project are going to be consistent.

43
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.610
So suppose that SA is the body and the body parts are going to be the classes which we have discussed

44
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.520
in the introduction and the working part.

45
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.090
Basically in the working part we have discussed that what are the required classes we have to make in

46
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.430
order to make this project function?

47
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:30.090
So yes, inside the Z folder we are going to create classes in order to make our download manager functional.

48
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:40.050
So inside the folder I am going to create a new file and I will be calling it as like.

49
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.420
The first step in the prototype was to create the main class.

50
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.720
So I am going to create our main class.

51
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.010
So download manager dot java so on hitting enter I will end up in this file.

52
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.700
Download Manager dot java is the main class.

53
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.090
Also our project.

54
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.940
And inside this main class we will be like testing and running the app.

55
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.270
Main consistency of this application.

56
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:19.120
Now inside the Download Manager class, we have imported various packages which are going to be like

57
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.810
used in this application.

58
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.030
So the packages they have imported are Java a WP dot star.

59
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:35.050
So this dot star means that we are importing all the packages of our AWP.

60
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.970
AWP stands for Abstract Window Toolkit, so we are importing all the components of this package.

61
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.090
Similarly, that AWP event, we are going to import all the components of this package on similarly

62
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.940
dot net, dot util or Java X, string and string given.

63
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:05.770
So these are the requirements of the packages which are going to be used inside this project.

64
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.100
We will be calling the components of these packages in order to make things functional.

65
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.560
Okay.

66
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:23.160
So this is the main class, a public class download manager and we have extended it as a frame as being

67
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.060
required of frame inside which everything is going to be consistent.

68
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:34.690
So yes, this extents GE frame is responsible for like creating a frame.

69
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:43.540
Now inside this class we will be adding the like consistence the text field, the download button,

70
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.400
the table and everything.

71
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:53.710
So we are going to look up to it one by one, everything we are going to cover inside this like code

72
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.330
tutorial part.

73
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.800
So let us see.

74
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.240
Okay.

75
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.880
So we have like created the class.

76
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:09.280
Now inside the class we are going to like initialize our object for the text field.

77
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.590
So a text field.

78
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.540
We are going to declare for the text field and text field.

79
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:30.790
So, okay, so after the declaration of the text field, we have declared the table model on the J table

80
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:39.490
component of the swing light JavaScript library and the buttons for pausing and canceling and resuming

81
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.010
and clearing the specific row.

82
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.000
We have already discussed about it in the introduction part.

83
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.570
Okay.

84
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.250
So we have declared the text field, all of these four buttons.

85
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.100
That's our table model and what's left.

86
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.680
So yes, the table and the selected download.

87
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:09.040
So we are going to select a specific group which will highlight like this blue blue background highlight

88
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.570
is done after the selection of a specific row.

89
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:18.880
So yes, that is going to be like done private boolean clearing.

90
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:29.320
So this is basically a flag for clearing a specific selection like the selection is being cleared or

91
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:29.800
not.

92
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.690
So it is going to be boolean.

93
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:39.700
Like if a selection is clear, then the boolean will be set to true and otherwise it will remain like

94
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.920
false by default.

95
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:48.600
Now in the next step, we are going to create the constructor for this download manager.

96
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:58.300
So initializing this download manager object and this constructor is going to be like a consist all

97
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.800
the objects of this download manager constructor.

98
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.720
So we are going to like set a title.

99
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.730
So what is the title?

100
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:17.320
We have already looked at the title of this is Download Manager with a download tab icon.

101
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.690
So inside this constructor we are going to set the title.

102
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:29.290
And inside this title are string like input is to be fed.

103
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:39.540
So download manager is going to be the title for our frame or the window, which opens up.

104
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:46.830
The next step is to set the size so we are done with the title.

105
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.990
Now we are setting the size.

106
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:55.560
So our length and width is to be like set.

107
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:05.130
So suppose 640 by 40 is going to be the size of the window, which is going to be the download manager's

108
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.180
window.

109
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:12.960
Now in the next step we are going to like handle windows closing events.

110
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.770
So okay, so adding add window.

111
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.250
Listener.

112
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.420
And this is going to like close the window.

113
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.380
New window.

114
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.940
And a new window adapter.

115
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:42.600
So let us type and new window adapter and this new window adapter is going to like close the window.

116
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.710
So it is going to be a method.

117
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.360
And in this method.

118
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.150
So inside braces, we are going to like set exit action.

119
00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:01.870
So firstly, creating a function public void, window closing.

120
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.080
And window closing is going to be a name of the function.

121
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.500
So window closing and the argument inside is is going to be an event.

122
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:19.210
So when the event e is going to be the name for the event.

123
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:27.610
And this will be responsible for closing the window if the user want to do so.

124
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.060
Okay.

125
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:37.300
So public void window closing and window event e inside this we are going to call action exit, which

126
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.580
will be responsible for like escaping from the download manager's window.

127
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.380
So okay, here we are.

128
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:50.180
Now we are done with the like title size and everything.

129
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.270
In the next part, we are going to set up the file menu.

130
00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:00.070
Like we are going to have our title as file.

131
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.900
We have looked up to it like this is our menu by title.

132
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:12.850
So calling the menu bar item component of the string library.

133
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:22.030
So J menu bar and the name is going to be menu bar and this is going to create a new menu bar for us.

134
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.880
So the name inside this is going to be like.

135
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:28.910
Okay.

136
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.690
So let us try to like import it.

137
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.380
Okay.

138
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.070
So we are done with the setting up of fine menu.

139
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.920
We have called this as file inside this string argument.

140
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:50.720
And this is going to be responsible for the title, which is going to be displayed on the top of the

141
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.850
table like a head.

142
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.230
You can see that.

143
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.060
And so exit action is also attached.

144
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:03.110
We can close the page like escape whenever we need it.

145
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.060
Also, yes, we have two buttons.

146
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.410
Add download.

147
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.350
Actually we have two columns for button.

148
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:19.220
So this is add download one and the second panel is for pause, resume and all of them.

149
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:27.860
So the first one is for ad download and this part is responsible for adding that add download button

150
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.790
to the frame.

151
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:36.040
So yes, we are done with the menu bar and the next part is G panel.

152
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:44.420
So we have added a panel for download thing and inside the panel are text field and that download button

153
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.770
is consistent.

154
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.660
So let me like make it practically clear what I am talking.

155
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:59.810
So yes, this panel, this complete panel below the file and the download above the download this panel

156
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.820
we are talking about.

157
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.440
And inside this panel we are having a new text field.

158
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.280
It is going to be its size by default.

159
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:16.340
And also our button J button is a component of the string library as well.

160
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:25.340
So yes, it is going to display add download and we are adding the action listener to the button which

161
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.470
is going to like perform a task.

162
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:35.090
Whenever we click the add download button, simply action add is going to like simply this action,

163
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.740
exit and action and is going to perform a specific task.

164
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:48.620
So we will be like adding this functionality later in this class also then this red underline will be

165
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.510
disappeared or Yes.

166
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:55.190
So we have added this add button to the panel successfully.
