1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,410
Our project is Java online system.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:12,370
So we are going to create one which platform for university level basic or you can create with for students

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,620
and teachers in audio you can consider like that.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,230
So we are going to create one online quiz system with the back end in return in the Java.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,190
So it's very useful to understand these parts.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,830
So Java project, this project is based on GBK, JSP, Java servlet and server deployment.

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,380
So I'm considering only the back end part I mentioned here GBK JSP Java servlet and server deployment

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,810
I'm going to consider there.

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:45,820
So we are going to create an online quiz system at a university level which using a JSP as a main backend

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,860
with the help of Java Servlet, also we are going to use we are going to connect with the database and

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,990
we are going to finally deploy on the server.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,890
So I'm going to consider here only the and we project here there are different libraries inside written

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,440
on Java or different approaches inside Java.

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,930
Like you can use Gradle, you can go with Mavin also.

15
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,510
So these are some famous frameworks inside Java Spring also is there, but I'm going to consider only

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,540
the end project because it's a very simple, basic and easier to understand than other frameworks.

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,290
Even though it's very basic thing, but it is a very helpful and essential or I can say effective platform

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,260
and project to create some online ecosystem from the scratch.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,380
So before proceeding with the project, I'm going to tell you you should have some basic knowledge about

20
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,830
Java classes methods, then about some knowledge of Java servlet and basic connection.

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,220
But this is all about the back end part.

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,600
In the further part, I'm going to do how we can create frontend and everything.

23
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,090
So let us see how we can create or we can proceed with our project.

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,280
So our project is basically develop a way of using Java for quiz platform at a university level, events

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,810
or examination with the help of Java Servlet, JSP, GBC.

26
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,900
So Java Servlet JSP GBC are the main backends part of our project, but.

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,180
These are main part I'm considering.

28
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,360
Are this is basically our project team steps off our development is first is project set up we are going

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,410
to set up our project.

30
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,020
Then understanding what we are going to use your different tools, we are going to use your some ID,

31
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,980
then JDK and some sort of work part also.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,310
So we are going to understand how basically they are going to work here then.

33
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,390
JSP Basics.

34
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,910
You should know about JSP Basics.

35
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,910
I am not going to tell.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:53,010
Like you should learn totally from this, but you should know some basic part of JSP then basics of

37
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,040
databases like my scalar oracle you can use here.

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,520
So how we can create database, then creation of table, then invoking and inserting inside that table.

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,670
So basic knowledge about database, relational database and considering here java servlet and gdb connection

40
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,550
you should know basic part of Java.

41
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,330
So development engine connection and deployment on the server.

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,540
So this is these are the some steps of our development.

43
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,060
But before that I'm going to tell how we are proceeding with the project.

44
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,920
So before proceeding this object, we should know about the basic outline.

45
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,410
So we have only two users here, which is basically first is teachers and other are students.

46
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,470
So teachers are basically admin roles and considering who has a right to change questions, then see

47
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,230
the student leads and then publish some results and etc. etc..

48
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,320
Second thing, which are basically student students are going to attempt their quiz.

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,410
They can see their marks and some results.

50
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,710
So you can create some advanced things like bleach apply for recheck, then teacher will get notifications

51
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,270
or remark.

52
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,900
The question for that like the question answer is wrong.

53
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,860
So I'm considering here only the CQ level or multiple choice questions here because handling multiple

54
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,560
choice questions with the JSP is very easier.

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,420
Or we can specify and we can get precise marking system inside that.

56
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,920
For advanced things.

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,800
You can create some long questions, like brief questions or two or three line questions.

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,940
You can add insert that, but it takes more time to deploy with the server or deploy with the database.

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,190
And according to that, you have to change the relational database and relational tables also inside

60
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,030
the database.

61
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,270
So application requirements.

62
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,150
I'm going to drill post Java program.

63
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,450
We need to display all the web contents inside the Java program.

64
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:57,400
So these are the Java programs only, but with the servlet and some JSP are also then Java program basic

65
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,560
knowledge you should have Java program basic knowledge like classes methods, the parameters attributes.

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,620
What is the public and difference between public and private?

67
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,990
Then we are going to create static things here.

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,620
Then basic concepts of skill DSP basics.

69
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,770
I'm going to tell the DSP basics inside this also, but if you know the basics, the understanding of

70
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,910
this, this project is become very easier to understand this then for these all out the back end.

71
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:31,780
But what about the front end part for the front end part, I'm going to use your HTML CSS basically

72
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,060
with the help of bootstrap.

73
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,980
Also, I'm going to create here beta.

74
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,570
So consider this, I'm not going to develop HTML and this frontend from the scratch, I'm going to use

75
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,140
some readymade CSS files available on the internet or I already created for the different projects.

76
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,330
Plus, I'm going to use some remote bootstrap programs which are already freely available on bootstrap

77
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,690
platform to deploy on our front end part.

78
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,780
Because creating from scratch, it's very difficult for due to time constraint.

79
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,210
Also, we are not focusing on the front end part of our project.

80
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:18,170
We are more focused on our back end part and developing the Java program for the system with database

81
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,070
connection also.

82
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:28,640
So we are considering here both our to use cases admin and students admin, not basically teachers.

83
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,150
I'm considering here as a day as an admin of our website or VP.

84
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:39,140
So there should be to log in for teachers also and students also student has to first register and then

85
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,220
go admin can and I have some privileges to change their parts and everything.

86
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,270
For admin or teachers we have to do some administrative actions like add questions, then search for

87
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:58,310
students, etc. etc. For students they have to give options like register, log in with submit and students

88
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,510
which are basically non administrative actions on these platforms.

89
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,480
If you see I have seen some quiz platforms online, you can choose front end of that also and you can

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,510
develop your own platform according to that.

91
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,050
So tools we are going to require is JDK 1.8.

92
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:21,260
So I'm considering here only JDK 1.8, which provides Java eight E Virgin Enterprise Edition version

93
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,540
for the Web dev deployment.

94
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:31,700
So this is very old, I'm considering, but it's very effective and it's work finally with without any

95
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,530
bugs or errors.

96
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,360
So I'm considering this JDK only then ID, I'm going to use your NetBeans.

97
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:46,060
You can choose any other famous IDE like eclipse intel idea you can consider, but creating with the

98
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:54,470
NetBeans is very easy as I'm going to use JDK 1.8 Java E Version eight is very useful for the web deployment.

99
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:02,390
Oracle Out of my skill database, you can choose both as your databases, but I'm going with Oracle.

100
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,490
You can choose my SQL, but you have to specify all things inside my skills.

101
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,460
So Oracle using Oracle is very easy.

102
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,950
You can choose a glass free server for deployment or Tomcat server for deployment.

103
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,510
Remember inside the Tomcat server you can change your http port, etc. etc. things.

104
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:26,930
But remember Tomcat server is Tomcat server only supports Java E version seven.

105
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,180
According to that, ERP changed everything.

106
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,130
So Tomcat Server, I'm going to use glass v server, but I told you how.

107
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:40,340
I will tell also how we can change our port and etc. inside this.

108
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,520
And for the oracle, I'm going for the database.

109
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,100
I'm going to use your Oracle database only you can easily download it from the official website, Oracle

110
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,570
19 C 18 C version.

111
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,650
So this is all about the application requirements of our project.

112
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,880
So these are some basic things we require for our project before proceeding with the project.

113
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,130
Let us see how we can.

114
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,550
Set up a little project first.

115
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,400
So as you can see, I already created everything.

116
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,650
But I will tell you from the scratch.

117
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,000
So let us see how we can create it from the scratch.

118
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,750
So go to the file first and create a new project.

119
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,150
Regardless of you have created any other project.

120
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,230
Go to file.

121
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,340
Create a new project.

122
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,840
Then go to the Java.

123
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,170
And you can see there are different applications like Java Maven, which is basically very advanced

124
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,230
thing for the Java, but different projects you can create with Java.

125
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,530
But I'm going to get going with and.

126
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,610
Then you can see the various options here.

127
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,110
Java effects, then Java Web to consider web and click next.

128
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,060
Then use the project name, then project location and project folder.

129
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,700
You can choose this also, but I'm not going to choose this part because it will automatically create

130
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,570
one library file also the next there.

131
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,030
Then before proceeding you are to specify the service and settings.

132
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,500
So I'm using your hourglass feature basically with Java eight.

133
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,760
If you don't download it, it click and then it will show you the downloading page for that and you

134
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,650
can create some context, but it will change according to your project next and create calendar here

135
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,240
finish.

136
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,030
I'm not going to click here finish because I already created one project for that purpose due to time

137
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,660
constraint.

138
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,180
So you can see in HTML it's very basic in HTML.

139
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,820
I already created one another in HTML for my purpose.

140
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,720
So you can see created already in the HTML pages, pages here.

141
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:58,890
So once you download it, you can go to our tools here and you can choose the server part.

142
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:05,520
So you can see this is a class B server I choose with these for http port.

143
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,710
In your case, htp port is might be a different for your purpose.

144
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:20,440
Once you go to the this part, you can see the one dialog box opens when you click the server part there.

145
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,630
So you can see the report is basically 8080 for your case.

146
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,590
But I will tell you how we can change that for.

147
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,030
So let us see how we can change that.

148
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,980
So first, go to your glass server platform, basically.

149
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:45,780
So it basically for the Windows system so you can go to your CDB users and go to your default name,

150
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:54,810
then go to the class, switch server, then go to the glass fish or that config file there and go to

151
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,780
the domains, then your default domain, then go to the config and check for the.

152
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,420
Domain.

153
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:14,790
XML file and open it with your default code editor or default script.

154
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,610
You can also use notepad also, so we are going to change that a little bit.

155
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,580
Search for your default.

156
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,680
Or basically your default port is AT&amp;T.

157
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,180
In my case, I already changed to 2002.

158
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,840
So you can see one line there.

159
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,890
Network listener.

160
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,080
I will show you once again.

161
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,720
I will show you inside that thing.

162
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,370
So.

163
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:48,070
The default thing is your code editor and change that to.

164
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,530
Oh, your your in your case, you can change it to the different thing.

165
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,060
Also.

166
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,830
Like I already changed it to the 2002.

167
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,270
As you can see.

168
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,650
As you can see, I already change it to the.

169
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,110
2000.

170
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,050
To put in your case, it should be 8080.

171
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,850
Change it to 32,000.

172
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,810
So this is a very important step for this purpose.

173
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,080
It should be located inside the domain of XML only.

174
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,970
So this is very important step for creating or basically creating basic outline for our project.

175
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,590
So let us see how we can go through this.

176
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Also, this is a basic GSP program we are going to create here.

177
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,830
So before proceeding the project, I'm going to tell you some

178
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:02,250
more part about how we can create this so you can choose this index or HTML.

179
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,550
So inside this is very basic.

180
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,330
I am choosing for some bootstrap and equity programs here already.

181
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,020
So these are some remote files.

182
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,800
If you look at this part, you can see in the remote files of our project also, these are the loaded

183
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,240
CSS, everything.

184
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,750
So this is the navigation bar and everything I choose.

185
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,640
Then I use this image.

186
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,450
Then I put this welcome to our platform online examination system with some information with basic based

187
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,830
on Java project I created, then I created one I container and everything.

188
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,710
So these are some basic things I use here.

189
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,560
So to use these things, what you are going to do is very simple thing you are going to create.

190
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,420
Just inside your project.

191
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:58,310
If you are using NetBeans ID go to online, then quiz that project folder, then go to the web and you

192
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,590
can see the web and index HTML.

193
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,490
So just copy, paste these all things and you're going to use your CSS, then bootstrap.

194
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:15,040
Then I'm going to main not meant to Node.js for CSS ergs, but then some logos part here.

195
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,730
So this is all about how we can proceed with our project for the time constraint.

196
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,850
I already created this index dot HTML with admin login and student login.

197
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,800
You can change it to the teachers.

198
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,590
Log in here also and next and everything.

199
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:37,610
So in the next tutorials I'm going to tell you how we can create with admin log in, JSP student log

200
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,990
in there JSP also.

201
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,110
So let us see how we can deploy this.

202
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,140
Just click here clean and build.

203
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,930
Once it is done, click run here.

204
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,850
So it takes.

205
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,360
A few minutes to reply on your default.

206
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:04,590
Or a project or a program, and it will take time to load everything because I'm using some web based

207
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,070
images.

208
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,450
So it will take time.

209
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,440
So as you can see, you can see welcome to our portal online system.

210
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,830
And this is so this is basically loading page for this animation.

211
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:22,350
I'm considering only these like you can see these animations, then this animation also here for I'm

212
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,810
using your bootstrap program here.

213
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:31,950
So as you can see, I can change these images also to different things as you can see.

214
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,540
So this is our basic loading.

215
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,520
Part of our JSP part.

216
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,090
In the next videos or next tutorials, I'm going to tell you how we are going to produce student log

217
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,850
in page then admin log in with the help of JSP.
