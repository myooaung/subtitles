1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,720
So here we will create our project by the name Rock, Paper, Scissors.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:19,360
So here I have my project by the Rock Paper Scissors, in which I have created a package with the name

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,610
images in which we have a paper rock and a scissor I can image in the form of being in the format.

4
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,510
PNG and another package.

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:38,020
I have a rock paper, scissors under which I have created this a frame form by the name game frame here.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,060
So here we have a frame.

7
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:50,560
Now, simply, we take a panel, drag here and enlarge this panel here.

8
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,630
And now go to the properties here.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,880
Please.

10
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,440
We need to set a border of darkness for.

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,880
Okay.

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,450
We give it a color also.

13
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,310
You take some?

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,690
That's all right, then.

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,640
Close.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,990
Here it is.

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,550
This is done.

18
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,500
And now what we need?

19
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,680
We need a label here.

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,660
This one.

21
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,660
For the mean flirting.

22
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
It will be us versus the computer.

23
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:53,030
So I will take all label and simply control plus.

24
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:53,950
And.

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,290
Okay.

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,540
Delete the spanner.

27
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,540
We don't need this control closed here.

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,780
We have another label here.

29
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,760
Simply adjust these levels.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,220
So then.

31
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,150
So here.

32
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,610
Done.

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,280
We have created our labels and simply.

34
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,460
Expect after.

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,330
Firstly, take another panel here.

36
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,370
Sorry.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,790
We need all nipples, not panel.

38
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,880
So here we will set a label.

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,030
Need another label here?

40
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,460
Here.

41
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,650
Take this label.

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,780
I need a.

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,180
The league would have to set first shift this.

44
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,110
Shiftless.

45
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,210
Not just here.

46
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,590
But here.

47
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,220
Okay.

48
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:38,520
So for this now added text and simply put the hyphen here and here simply added text on.

49
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,610
Four zero.

50
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,640
MILLER zero one.

51
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:58,130
We have to do this like these three labels and go to the properties and enlarge the font size, put

52
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:05,000
it to 24 to bold and so set close down.

53
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,270
Firstly.

54
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,640
Near the horizontal alignment to the sun center.

55
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,660
Close.

56
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:27,780
Here on me we have to enlarge for 2448.

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,070
Okay, then.

58
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,520
36 tone notes.

59
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,230
Here.

60
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,300
Take another Naples.

61
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,130
Good care.

62
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,820
And another level is here.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,310
Here we will write.

64
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,830
You are this computer.

65
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,750
Computer, simply select both this level.

66
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,660
Change the font size here.

67
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,580
Make it bold.

68
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,540
The.

69
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,710
King.

70
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,480
Those.

71
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,240
Horizontal alignment center close.

72
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,460
Large this.

73
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,380
Large this.

74
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,100
Read this text here.

75
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,830
Okay.

76
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:25,180
Now we need another three levels where we put out rock, paper, scissors, images.

77
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,670
So here, take this label.

78
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,600
So you okay?

79
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,560
We need to just adjust all these.

80
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,040
Here.

81
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,410
Here.

82
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,880
The rules that all these two.

83
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,230
You're done.

84
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,180
No need to set these labels here.

85
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,090
Simply put, the control policy.

86
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,440
Put this label here.

87
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,900
Control plenty and put this label here.

88
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:43,850
Simply, I detect clear text clear and text clear.

89
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,610
So here we have.

90
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,190
All five labels for the image part.

91
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,060
So now we have to give the variable names also.

92
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,200
So.

93
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,430
Firstly like this Julie will change.

94
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,570
Variable name.

95
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,160
No score.

96
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,720
We have to write you.

97
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:33,240
You wince and the next level change with name and portrait computer once.

98
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,330
The grandparents now we need.

99
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,590
Okay.

100
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,830
So.

101
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,880
This labour change is the third one.

102
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,470
Change really will mean.

103
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,240
To your score.

104
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,880
This one for change variable name to computer score.

105
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,340
So this one is done.

106
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,080
No.

107
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,950
We have to change the variable of this tree so we will set it to.

108
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:39,160
First one is for Chile and we need rock purposes.

109
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,490
Okay.

110
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,900
So the first one is rock.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,490
Okay.

112
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:51,070
Julie will nine will be sent to the Liverpool nine Rock.

113
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:51,490
The

114
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,830
last one will be the scissor.

115
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,350
Here we have a little variable names and what you like.

116
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:13,700
So simply go here and run this file.

117
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,470
Okay.

118
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,360
Now, let's say maybe.

119
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,350
Yeah.

120
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,570
Something wrong?

121
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,090
Okay.

122
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,520
Okay.

123
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,930
So this part is done and now we simply see our.

124
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,030
Yeah.

125
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,980
So it's running and of course it's going good and we have our way out here.

126
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:02,170
So now we have to create borders for these square blocks where we have set the images.

127
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,470
So let's see that part.
