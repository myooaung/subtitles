00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.300
So in this video we will be talking about the class or window, which will appear after the successful

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.840
login of the user then so that this class will appear.

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.260
The coding of the class, which will appear after the login is done in this file, which is Project

4
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.320
Java, as you have remembered inside the login when successful login in the event statement, we have

5
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.410
called this class, so this will be the main page after the login.

6
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.070
So in this class first we have imported the necessary packages like Java, Start, Swing District,

7
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.840
Java JWT, Java dot, dot, and now the project class has been defined which is extending the frame

8
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.460
and implementing action listener.

9
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.890
Interface.

10
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.570
After that we have defined its non parameter constructor inside which we have set its size as 2000 comma

11
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.200
11 and this will be the size for that window.

12
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.050
After that, get content and setting the background of that window of the window of this current class

13
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.770
as white.

14
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.440
After that, inside the image I can I run.

15
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.170
We have loaded the image with the help of class.

16
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.010
Don't get sys resource inside which we have passed the location of the image which is icon slash payload

17
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.210
or java and jpg.

18
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.900
After that, inside the image icon, we have a scaled instance of that image icon and set its size as

19
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.710
12,700.

20
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.230
That will be size.

21
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.960
After that, the scaled image is again stored in an image icon object that is three and then that a

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.270
three.

23
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.170
Image icon object has been passed as an argument to the G label L1.

24
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.690
So that G label will be containing that image.

25
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.560
And after that we have added that label to our G frame.

26
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.170
Now what we are doing is we are creating a menu bar.

27
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.710
So we have initialize the menu bar instance me and then we have set that menu bar in our frame.

28
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.220
After that, what we are doing is of defining a menu element that is labelled as master and we have

29
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.820
set the foreground colour for that menu element as blue.

30
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.320
After that we have added menu items in that menu element.

31
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.980
Master.

32
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.670
So the first menu item we have added is D one, which is new employee.

33
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.260
So inside the master menu element, we will be having an item as new employee.

34
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:39.210
We have set the foreground colour as blue for that menu item and its font family and type and size.

35
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.800
We have defined families.

36
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.280
Mono escape, font type is plain and font size is 12.

37
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.160
Then we have set the minimum as an.

38
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.620
After that, we have set the demon set accelerator for the keystroke because menu item will be selected

39
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.130
or will handling the key strokes.

40
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.020
So that's why we have defined key stroke dot get key stroke inside we have passed the key event and

41
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.130
action event.

42
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.060
And after that we have defined the one point set icon which will set the icon or image with the help

43
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.490
of class loader that get system resource icon slash new dot page.

44
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.340
That will be the name of the end location of that particular image.

45
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.030
Then we have added another menu item, D-3 three, that will be celery labeled as celery, said the

46
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.530
foreground, color as blue.

47
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.660
We have also set its font type or font properties that font formerly as mono skipped font type as plain

48
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.010
and font size 12.

49
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.790
Set them anonymous as s.

50
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:53.940
Similarly, for that particular menu item, we have also defined or loaded the class image with the

51
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.320
help of class or get system results by passing the location of that image.

52
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.050
And we have designed the set accelerator key store for that particular menu item also.

53
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.780
Similarly, there is another menu item inside that menu element that is a list employed.

54
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.690
We did the same thing with that also color as equals to blue set the font properties for it meant a

55
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.300
loading the image icon for that particular menu item and defining the key struct keystroke also.

56
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.530
After that, what we did is we have added those menu items to our menu element and one and after that

57
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.050
we have added that menu element to our menu bar.

58
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.420
Then we have defined the action is not over those three menu items 23 and 34.

59
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.690
Then we have defined another menu element as update.

60
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.320
Set its foreground color as red.

61
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.340
After that, we have added that menu element to our menu bar.

62
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.390
Then we have defined the menu items for that menu element.

63
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.970
First menu item is updated celery.

64
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.840
Its foreground color is blue, font properties is mono shape, font type is plain and font size is 12.

65
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.500
Set them as you.

66
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.920
After that, we have set the icon or image for that particular menu item.

67
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.730
After that we have defined the key similarly like the previous menu items.

68
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.850
Added that menu item to that menu element.

69
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.820
After that, we have defined another menu item which is update employee did the same thing with that

70
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.390
menu item.

71
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.120
Also set the foreground color as blue font properties, set them and loaded the image which will be

72
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.470
required to show at that particular menu item and define the keystroke.

73
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.450
After that, we have added that menu item also to our menu element.

74
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.130
Then we have defined another menu item for that particular menu element, which is take attendance,

75
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.250
set the colors blue, foreground and the font property.

76
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.430
Set the minimum dynamic as to.

77
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.520
Added an image and defined the keystroke for that particular menu item, added that menu item to menu

78
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.900
bar.

79
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.840
After that, what we are doing is we have added access to over that menu items and then we have defined

80
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.270
another menu as reports.

81
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.890
So we have said the foreground color of the report added that to our menu bar and its menu item will

82
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:24.530
be generate payslip setting the foreground color font menu icon and defining keystroke over that menu

83
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.070
item.

84
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.480
After that, we have added that menu item to the menu element.

85
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.990
Then we have defined another menu item as listed and set its foreground colour and its font properties

86
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.560
like mono script, font type font plane and its size as well.

87
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.760
After that we have defined its metonymy.

88
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.230
Then we have added an image for that particular menu item as well.

89
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.900
After that we have defined the set accelerator and.

90
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.530
Keystroke method for that particular menu item.

91
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.760
Then we have added that menu item to our menu element.

92
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.560
Then we have set payment point, add accent listener and pay to add action listener.

93
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.720
After that, there is another menu item menu element as utilities.

94
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:15.300
Inside, which we have set its foreground color as red added that utility menu element to our menu bar

95
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.620
set its.

96
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.220
Menu item first is a notepad.

97
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.720
So these will be the utilities that a user can use.

98
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.980
Set icon for that notepad menu item font as blue foreground color as view font properties are mono skip

99
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.680
plain and 12 may not make as well.

100
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.450
Defining a great stroke for that particular menu item as well.

101
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.950
Similarly, what we are doing is we have defined added another, added that menu item to the menu element.

102
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.320
Then we have defined another utility for the calculator and also set its required foreground color font

103
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.470
properties metronomic and defining accelerator keystroke.

104
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.700
I did that over utility as well.

105
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.090
The third menu item for that utility section is web browser.

106
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.610
Did the same thing with web browser menu item as well.

107
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.130
Added that to our menu element.

108
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.970
Then we have defined action is not a word.

109
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.370
All of these three.

110
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.320
Menu items.

111
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:19.950
After that, there is a menu element as exits and the color as red added that to our menu.

112
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:26.140
But then we are defined as menu item as exit and add that to our menu element and then set the following

113
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.360
color blue font properties.

114
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.550
And it's this.

115
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.820
We have also added image that to that menu icon and defined its key stroke method.

116
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.580
After that we have added excellence to that particular menu item.

117
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.670
Now we have defined the action, the method.

118
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.480
Which is taking our argument as action event.

119
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.150
So what happening here is a strong message.

120
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.430
It goes to a market action command.

121
00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:01.200
So it does string message will restore the action command from that action event object.

122
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.450
Now, if the message is equals to new employee.

123
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.260
So if the.

124
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.770
Event is at the new employment new item.

125
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.270
Then what we were doing we will be calling the new employer class and setting is visible.

126
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.050
It's true.

127
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:19.380
Similarly, if else, if the message equals less to employ, then we will call the list employer, class

128
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.970
and status visibility as true.

129
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:27.660
And if the message dot equals update employer, then we will call the update employ method and set visibility

130
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.290
as to.

131
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:37.600
If the message is equal to the salary menu item, then we will set the call the salary class and set

132
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.170
the visibility.

133
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:47.470
As to if the update salary is the event of the menu item, then we will be set or call the update salary

134
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.020
class and set the visibility as true.

135
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:58.330
If the notepad menu item has been selected, then what we will be doing is running our notepad with

136
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:04.840
the help of runtime target runtime dot x ac notepad dot x xy and.

137
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.720
After that.

138
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.570
What we are doing is if masses dot equals calculator.

139
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.380
Inside the try block, we will be executing or opening the calculator application.

140
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.490
After that, if the message is equal to web browser, then we will be running our web browser.

141
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.570
This is the location of my web browser file.

142
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.540
If I have to change to your particular location of any web browser, otherwise this will not run.

143
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.590
Then else, if message dot equals take attendance, then we will be calling.

144
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.710
Take attendance class and status visibility as true and elseif the message dot equals to exit.

145
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.410
Then we will close our program with the help of System Dot Exit zero.

146
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.820
If message dot equals as goes to generate payslip, then we'll be calling our payslip class and status

147
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.920
visibility as true.

148
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.070
And at last the message is equal to list attendance.

149
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:58.710
We will be calling our list attendance, class and settings results through and inside the main method

150
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.800
we have called our project class and set is visibility as true.

151
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.830
So this is all about the project class which will be opening and using after the successful login.
