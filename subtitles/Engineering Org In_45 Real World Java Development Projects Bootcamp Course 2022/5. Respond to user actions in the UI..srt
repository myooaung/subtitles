1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,130
Who inside the ski press matter.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,380
We will check what keys were pressed.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,690
We have already checked with this.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,280
So now we control the command object with the cursor.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,010
So if we press the left cursorily check.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,930
So command collides with the wall of the baggage.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,440
If it does not, we will move to the one with the left.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,630
So mostly we need a case of the left.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,900
We need the case of the key.

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,260
So when the key renders the ARCHE, we restart the level.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,110
So here I will take the case and put the key event.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,040
Just we need the next week left.

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,090
We key?

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,360
I think you get this one right.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,910
So we will check for this.

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:10,030
And if so, we have to create one condition that will check the whole coalition.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,830
So here we will name that matter with the check of all coalition here.

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,640
Give the barometer, the player it will check.

19
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,050
Is that left coalition or not?

20
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:44,980
Here.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,870
Under this.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,880
Simply return.

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,270
And we will create this check.

24
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,670
All coalition.

25
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,890
Okay.

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:08,740
Return it will check if need to create the check back collision method also.

27
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,860
So here I will give the parameter with the left collision here

28
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:25,150
simply notice we will right return create the check back condition matter also.

29
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,020
So done here and now we need the circle move.

30
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,990
So here, I mean.

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,540
Right.

32
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,910
So you need to create a move matter which will move it minus.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,990
We need the space variable here and just put with the comma zero and break.

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,220
Create the move.

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,200
Okay.

36
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,220
You know what we will do now?

37
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,990
We need to check for the right press key.

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,620
And so here I will take the case.

39
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,850
Key rent.

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,450
Not Ricky, right?

41
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,060
It will check.

42
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,310
Same with the previous one.

43
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:30,040
First with the wall collision and second one with the back collision.

44
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:35,300
So here, check with the wall collision and here I will kill.

45
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,000
Right collision.

46
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,250
Into this we right return.

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,640
Next one is for check back collision here.

48
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,740
Give the barometer to the right coalition.

49
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,280
Simply return and return.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,050
Now what we have to do, we need the SOCO to move.

51
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,130
We need the movement of our players.

52
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:16,690
So here I will give space variable next case to zero.

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,040
So we have a restart the level here.

54
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,260
If we press the okay.

55
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,650
No, no, we have not done that.

56
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,470
We will do one after.

57
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,060
Okay.

58
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,740
So we have checked with the left and right now we need to check the up and the downwards also.

59
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,920
So here after that, so could not move in the break here.

60
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,490
And now we need another case which will be key rent.

61
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,630
Key event here.

62
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,670
We came up here, this one up alone.

63
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:11,830
If check wall coalition here give these so common here it will be the dog coalition not collision.

64
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,590
Simply return.

65
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,620
Need another if loop it will check the back collision here.

66
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:29,140
Give the collision variable as the argument and just simply return this.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,590
Now we need to move the circle and get this zero on here.

68
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,830
Due to the space variable and just break.

69
00:05:47,330 --> 00:06:01,370
Now we need to check for the next one, which will be our case right now or the weekend down here.

70
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,580
Here I will write the same with the previous funding check wall collection.

71
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,060
Here.

72
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,590
Check.

73
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,900
Also here.

74
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,990
I will give the down no bottom collision

75
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,340
return.

76
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,400
Next student which we have to check the back collision.

77
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,000
Give the bottom collision as a parameter as the argument and just simply return.

78
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,410
Okay.

79
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,350
Now, after that, we have to clear.

80
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,760
So-called art move.

81
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,300
You've d0 and put it to space

82
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,320
and break.

83
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,450
Okay.

84
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:13,910
Don't break that down to the minute we hear the space and simply remove to break.

85
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,110
Okay, so now we have to.

86
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,590
Okay.

87
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,570
So we have to restart the level if the player press the arc also.

88
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,570
So here I will take that case.

89
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,900
Then I will write case key.

90
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,190
Write it and just put our.

91
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,590
This one, we get our cologne.

92
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,250
Under that we will create a model which will restart our level.

93
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,360
So I will that my third restart level

94
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,360
just simply break it on the method, restart level.

95
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,000
None.

96
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,100
No.

97
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,320
All cases are done.

98
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,820
We need to follow one case.

99
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,500
So had I been tried break.

100
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,650
After that.

101
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,530
Okay.

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,590
We have this.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,050
Okay, now we need to.

104
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,680
Okay, so now we need to define this back collision and the collision.

105
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,370
So firstly, we will go with the collision key.

106
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:46,550
So the Jaguar collision matter was created here to ensure that a soccer ball or a baggage do not pass

107
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,600
the ball.

108
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:54,410
So there will be four type of collision star, first on the left, next on the right.

109
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,510
The other one are the up and the down collision, the top and the bottom.

110
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:11,720
So here what we have to do under this, we will create a switch and give the parameter to type here.

111
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:13,730
No.

112
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:20,750
Simply, the Turkey is not coalition.

113
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

114
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,850
So, no, not that.

115
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,050
Okay.

116
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,980
It's not okay.

117
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,970
We have to create this type variable and two other class.

118
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:57,510
So firstly, it will take closely to change their parameters to actor actor and it will take in type.

119
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,080
We don't know.

120
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,960
We need the left condition first.

121
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,910
It will ensure that the so called package do not pass the ball.

122
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:20,310
So take a for loop here and give the end equal to zero and I should be less than one stored size.

123
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,270
And I even.

124
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,820
Plus.

125
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,450
Plus.

126
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,130
And then.

127
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:32,030
Now we need the whole sequel to False.

128
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,890
Don't get give the idea next year.

129
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,500
Now we need the condition.

130
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:50,010
If I do this, we have to create some steam later in the upper class.

131
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,020
So we will name your last coalition.

132
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,920
And you've deep argument with Paul here.

133
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,500
Okay.

134
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:11,160
So what we have to do on this, we will return through.

135
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,790
So it will go to the art class.

136
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,920
And after that check.

137
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,520
Okay.

138
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,490
So the left coalition is done.

139
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,960
If it is not true, it will simply return false.

140
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,870
We?

141
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,120
Simply written false here.

142
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:54,410
And after false, we have to create a case which will change the right coalition here and here.

143
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:01,560
I will take another for loop, which will check the so common or baggage.

144
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,260
Do not pass the ball, so it will be for the right collision.

145
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,500
So here I will write in equal to zero.

146
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,840
I should be less than to false not signs

147
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:26,910
C++ and blurred this you will write one one equal to one stored get I hear.

148
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,070
Okay.

149
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,560
Now we need another condition.

150
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,880
Actor and we have to create is right coalition.

151
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:49,480
Give the argument to the world and just simply return true or.

152
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:51,910
Okay.

153
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,740
So return true simply after that.

154
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,590
Here I will.

155
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,740
Right.

156
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,470
Return false.

157
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,370
And now we need to check with the case of top coalition.

158
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:19,190
I will take the four loop and time equal to zero and I should be less than the world size.

159
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,540
And I should be.

160
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,710
Plus, plus.

161
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,700
Here I will write volleyball equal to one store to get.

162
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,570
I check it with the if actor not here.

163
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,050
I will create another matter with the top collision name is top collision.

164
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,100
Give the parameter with the all here.

165
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,670
Now I know that we will simply return.

166
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,490
True, and don't start.

167
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,470
Simply return false.

168
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,740
Don't volunteer.

169
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:07,840
Okay.

170
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,060
So now we have check with the top and the right and the left.

171
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,240
And now we need the bottom coalition lost.

172
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:28,320
So case bottom coalition here and it will take the forward loop that is equal to zero here.

173
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:35,700
I should be less than two walls, not size and I should be plus.

174
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,360
Plus.

175
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,140
Dictaphone.

176
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,970
Roll call.

177
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,220
Roll start.

178
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,280
Get I.

179
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,240
Okay.

180
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,300
Well, start to get early and it will take same as the previous one.

181
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:07,160
If there is, we will create is bottom coalition in the class and take the parameter with the here and

182
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,770
it should return.

183
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:18,620
True or else after all of this return false.

184
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,580
Now we need to create a default case.

185
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,670
Default case here.

186
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,060
Simply break.

187
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,560
This.

188
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,750
Simply return.

189
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,730
False.

190
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,690
So here we have the net part.

191
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,050
And it will goes with.

192
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,660
Who will create it.

193
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,240
Same goes with this.

194
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,920
Don't collision, create a martyrdom type actor.

195
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:12,980
And same thing goes with Diesel.

196
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:26,870
Okay.

197
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,910
Now.

198
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:35,360
Tomorrow it will because we have to do a common coalition.

199
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,230
We have to do this.

200
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,090
Now, what we will do.

201
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,910
We will create.

202
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,410
After that.

203
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,940
We already have the ball.

204
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,000
So here we have the back collision here also.

205
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,890
So simply just give the parameter to the type here.

206
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,540
And now here we have to go.

207
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,290
This attack back collision.

208
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,140
It will be more involved.

209
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,190
A baggage can collide with a wall, with a so-called object or with another baggage.

210
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:19,080
The baggage can be moved only if it collides with the so common.

211
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,410
So it does not collide with another package or a wall.

212
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,630
So we will see that.
