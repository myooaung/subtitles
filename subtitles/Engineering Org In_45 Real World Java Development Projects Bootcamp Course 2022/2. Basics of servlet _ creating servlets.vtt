00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.420
In previous part, I told you about servlet.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.140
So now I am going to create some HTML pages.

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.390
Then some java logic here.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.580
So mainly it consists only html pages and all things.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.590
You can also create JSP here.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.390
So what is JSP is basically Java solid pages, which uses some java language inside HTML.

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.060
So here I'm using only html pages.

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.820
But you can use JSP Logic here also.

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.380
JSP page consists of tags, JSP tags, some expressions also.

10
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.270
So JSP has more or more advantages on servlet part, but for the understanding purpose, I'm going with

11
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.820
the JSP, so here I am considering only two part like admin which has role to ad librarian.

12
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.120
And librarian is going to check all the student records and everything.

13
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.570
So you can also include some student method also here.

14
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.530
But as a considering, student method is very complicated here.

15
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.790
You can go with two parts on admin to add administrative actions and librarian to manage everything.

16
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.090
So this is all about how we can create JSP.

17
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.750
So JSP is having advantages more than so.

18
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.910
It's like it's extension of servlet.

19
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.120
It's again easy to maintain past development.

20
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.300
No need to re complain, recompile and redeploy again and again.

21
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.640
Part.

22
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.540
So these are all about DSP.

23
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.080
Jtbc is Java database connection.

24
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.240
So as we know, this is very crucial.

25
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.320
Like we don't want to include in text file, we just want a database here.

26
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.750
So database consists of different types of tables, database and etc..

27
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.100
So I'm using your only relational database, not play SQL or anything relational database, and I'm

28
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.830
going to use the relational SQL queries only.

29
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.780
So database stands for Java database connectivity databases and Java API to connect, execute and query

30
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.680
with the database.

31
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.680
So each and every database is already created there.

32
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.290
Developers already created GBK connectors for Java API as Oracle consists of GBK with 14/10 version.

33
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.740
Newer versions also are available with the purpose.

34
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.590
Also, my SQL connector is for my skill.

35
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.880
So these are two examples of relational database.

36
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.220
If you go further with MongoDB and different database, you will understand that there are GB drivers

37
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.450
available on the internet.

38
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.460
So there are four types of database for Oracle database.

39
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.390
It's twin driver.

40
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.920
Basically we are going to use and ODB.

41
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.390
My SQL is bridge driver, then native driver.

42
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.080
Network protocol driver drivers are used for different, different purposes.

43
00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.250
So we can use GDB app to access tabular data stored in the relational database with the help of GDB

44
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.970
API.

45
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.430
So we can save update, delete fetch data from database so we can use that part also.

46
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.220
So let us see what is gdb.

47
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.090
See api.

48
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.600
So see api is nothing but java application.

49
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.280
Connector which connects gdb API and GDB key driver and gdb said driver connects to the database.

50
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.990
So it will be very, very helpful to create a database connection.

51
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.020
So let us go to ID all.

52
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.470
As I told you, I already created this part, but no need to worry.

53
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.870
I will explain each and every thing.

54
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.830
So I'm using this bootstrap thesis part.

55
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.080
As you can see, this is my bootstrap thesis file, so nothing.

56
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.040
But I'm just adding bootstrap failure and main purchases.

57
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.240
And this is all about judges.

58
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.170
So it's nothing but consistent.

59
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.150
These types of let me lose this part again.

60
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.900
So you can just directly use and download it from the internet available.

61
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.910
I'm using.

62
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.170
Different things here now.

63
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.870
And I am also adding some part also here.

64
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.630
Forget about this, but I'm adding some images here.

65
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.860
With some things, as you can see for my skill, connection and everything.

66
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.890
So close.

67
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.540
So it is landing page on first place in the testament email.

68
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.940
Don't change this in the HTML because it's already written in configuration file.

69
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.570
So everything.

70
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.450
As you can see, manifest and everything written in HTML is basically the loading part here.

71
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.220
So in this part, this welcome page, I'm printing the title, this is my stylesheet.

72
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.990
I'm creating navigation bar.

73
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.780
So you can change this also with different, different things.

74
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.180
But for this purpose, I'm putting as in this HTML first part and everything.

75
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.120
And this is home for admin and library.

76
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.140
And I will change it again because I'm loading this only.

77
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.180
So I'm printing in the same part.

78
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.710
I can use this only.

79
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.780
Let me change to this only and it's only because I'm printing in the same if you want to change it in

80
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.440
another part.

81
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.170
Like if you want to create some another thing here, you can use that part also.

82
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.110
And let me mention the class also.

83
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.710
You can create different pages for admin, admin and library, but I'm creating one single page.

84
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.230
I'm collapsing this part.

85
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.940
And this is my e-library.

86
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.780
Let me.

87
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.980
Within this part then.

88
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.390
Okay.

89
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.570
So this is all about these things.

90
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.780
So I'm creating admin login page here.

91
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.490
Don't worry, these all things are related to tags with class and roles.

92
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.690
Admin login method is post again and what I'm creating.

93
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.710
I'm creating.

94
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.900
From U.S. Army.

95
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.740
Remember?

96
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.520
From action.

97
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.070
Action should be with some.

98
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.100
I'll put a name or we can say with some default or not ABC or something.

99
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.780
It should have some proper name because we are going to create some part also there.

100
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.480
So my suggestion is you can create this admin login inside another part.

101
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.830
Let me.

102
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.630
I mentioned this.

103
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.560
Okay, so I'm going to use this logic.

104
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.790
So let is I'm going to tell in writing a solid part.

105
00:06:52.790 --> 00:07:01.580
I'm going to create some packages and some packages for like you can see that there are some we are

106
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.390
going to create some more solid so or Java logic.

107
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.420
So it will be very hectic to check each and every part.

108
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.520
So for that purpose I'm going to use this servlet with email then.

109
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.440
This is basically labeled an input and then another with the password.

110
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:26.590
Similarly, for this purpose, I'm going to put your servlet library and port login because I'm going

111
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.390
to create inside that only.

112
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.710
And this is I'm submit part so this is all about how we can create index dot html.

113
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.640
So this is basic thing I'm going to create.

114
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:45.990
So after this, I'm going to write a logic for servlet dot admin login.

115
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.290
So let me create one servlet here.

116
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.330
I'm not going to go with default package.

117
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.290
I'm going to create another package, your java package.

118
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.000
Name a solid.

119
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.590
CORNISH So this new default package inside this, I'm going to create admin log in.

120
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.210
Not just.

121
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.610
After you write the new dialog box is open.

122
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.080
So I'm going to create a name that servlet dialog box will be open.

123
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:26.890
Then click next on that dialog box after giving the name, add information to the deployment and descriptor

124
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.360
clicks and click finish.

125
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.270
So once this is done, you can see solid, consistent log in part.

126
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.140
You can change this and delete this part also.

127
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.070
Let me add your admin.

128
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:41.730
No.

129
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.420
So let us write this part step by step.

130
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:57.600
So let me add some or import some libraries, which is basically import Java.

131
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.350
Dot, dot, dot, I'm using here.

132
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:07.250
Then I'm going to use your servlet, Java X servlet, basically.

133
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.820
So import as I told you, you need to.

134
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.700
Joe, like solid.

135
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.560
Dot star.

136
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.830
So I'm doing this today and I'm just importing.

137
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.590
I need a HTTP part also here, so I will.

138
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.490
Duration HD beat North Star.

139
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:33.550
So.

140
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.550
So I will put here as.

141
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.960
Importing.

142
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.780
Libraries.

143
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.380
That's it.

144
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.330
So now we are done with this.

145
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.550
Let me.

146
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.570
And I despaired again because we are going to override this only.

147
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.750
So it will take time to check everything.

148
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.510
So as you can see this.

149
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.400
Or you can close this part.

150
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.180
On why it is not okay.

151
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.230
It will remove that error later.

152
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.420
Oh.

153
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.440
Uh.

154
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.890
I'm not.

155
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.550
When it will not win.

156
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.250
If you are doing this.

157
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.200
It is from this and it includes the Spartans.

158
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.830
So.

159
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.840
The public.

160
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.800
We are going to create class, basically.

161
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.760
So basically our public class is basically public class.

162
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.240
I'd been logging.

163
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.690
We are going to create.

164
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.770
Admin log in your.

165
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.470
We take strain http solid.

166
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.520
Let me copy this part because.

167
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.130
And again, HTP.

168
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:26.570
So not only servlet HTTP server that you're going to mention here http.

169
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.190
So.

170
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.770
Now we are mentioning this.

171
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.570
Let me add one protected area to post method.

172
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.080
So.

173
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.450
Me cancel this and type it again.

174
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.340
Sometimes you use error because of.

175
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.200
Some part.

176
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.390
Let me add it again.

177
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.780
So what?

178
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.570
You can remove this part again because it's no longer required.

179
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.240
Okay.

180
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.220
So let's.

181
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.850
Now we are done with this.

182
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.140
So let us right the logic here, basically.

183
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.110
So in the next part, I'm going to tell you how we can create the logic here.

184
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.480
But before creating a logic, let me write some part here.

185
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.700
And I will tell you what is this part?

186
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.050
So this is nothing but a solid part.

187
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.510
Here, basically, we are just overriding this part.

188
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.020
So we need to mention this web.

189
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.230
Solar.

190
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.230
If you don't want to enter, you can also.

191
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.570
No need to mention this again and again.

192
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:51.510
So we created a response and this and we need a writer to print something on similar page, which is

193
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.040
item in section and everything.

194
00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:00.470
And I'm going to create a HTML page inside this only, which is basically admin section.

195
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.990
We can say admin panel, your only.

196
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.450
So.

197
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.400
I am taking the request from string.

198
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.840
Which is basically connected to the.

199
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.370
That part fitting request.

200
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.810
I'm fitting the request.

201
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:31.030
So if you want to give another string also, you can do what I'm going to do.

202
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:40.230
I mean, we'll ask for switching that part from HTML and I'm creating logic for login.

203
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.420
So if you don't want to put some default here, you can add it to the database.

204
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.590
But for the security convenience, I'm going to check from direct things.

205
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.930
So I will.

206
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.020
What I will do is you're.

207
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.150
I will bring her string.

208
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.600
Even is equal to.

209
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.050
I mean.

210
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:07.700
Not.

211
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.140
Me.

212
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.130
I did it.

213
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.170
You and me, which is basically nothing.

214
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.420
No need to check each and everything.

215
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.970
I can check change this part also.

216
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.760
What I'm going to put is is string P one is also.

217
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:29.940
I mean, one, two, three.

218
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.350
So this will be the password and username for log admin.

219
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.320
You put your credentials or any.

220
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:43.620
Finch.

221
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.980
So this will be the credential for admin page.

222
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:52.610
So now you will understand I am going to create a false part here only which each and everything is

223
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.660
simple Java.

224
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.550
So let me use that first part and you will understand this.

225
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.180
So this is very easy, useful thing you can use here.

226
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:09.170
In further part, I'm going to create some library and methods and issue ebook login library and each

227
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.620
part.

228
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.510
So for further development, I'm going to use Java.

229
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:16.780
So.
