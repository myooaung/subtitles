1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:09,930
So before loading our images into the image area, we have to create a constructor of our class, a

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,490
parameterized constructor in which we will take a board initial.

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,330
So what we will write.

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,930
We will write a public board.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,730
Give the parameters with the G label status for.

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,110
A new bracket open.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,940
The START status.

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,170
We need the status.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,740
Okay.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,620
The stance is what is equal to the status bar.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,880
We need to create a method by the initial board here.

12
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,660
Okay.

13
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,950
So in this matter, this created.

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,520
Create.

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,570
Feel.

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,190
Create.

17
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,850
Feel.

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,610
Private label.

19
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,570
History does what it should be.

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,310
Final, also private, final and done.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,060
Becky Sue So this thing is done.

22
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,570
Now what we have to do.

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,860
We have to do our code of loading images into the image area here.

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,110
So here I will write.

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,340
Let's see.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,310
Send the preferred size first.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,760
King said.

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,960
True full size.

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,550
Here.

30
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:14,460
I will write a new dimension and get the parameter at the board width.

31
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,620
First comma.

32
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,690
Board height.

33
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,740
And then.

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,250
Set for science.

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,570
No.

36
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,880
We have just a minute.

37
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,100
Just hear what we have to do.

38
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,340
We will take our image and rehearse.

39
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,630
So we will write.

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,520
I am g equal to new image.

41
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,460
And this we will give no.

42
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,860
Here and now, images of images we have total that is 13.

43
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,480
So this will be the size of our area.

44
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:24,300
And here we will take a four loop and fry it in three equal to zero.

45
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:37,470
And I is less than with the normal number of images and make the increment curly bracket open here we

46
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,130
will write variable part equal to and here we will give the part.

47
00:03:44,610 --> 00:04:03,030
So it is under CRC resources slash done and I and plus and not be in g data image.

48
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,900
The next one is equal to new image.

49
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,380
Here I will write image.

50
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:21,090
I could take the part node get image and this is done.

51
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,790
So here we load our images in the image area.

52
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:35,760
The images are named as 2012, three, four, five and so on with the dot, p and G.

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:45,510
So the next thing we have to do is to initialize the minesweeper game with our new method called this

54
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,380
new game.

55
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:56,070
So here I will take that matter and write new game and create this method.

56
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,510
Not.
