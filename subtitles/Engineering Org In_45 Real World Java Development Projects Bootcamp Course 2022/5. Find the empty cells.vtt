1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.110
So now we will create our method, find empty cells.

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:15.190
You will write creamy wine and name it as fine.

3
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.030
The cells.

4
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.190
Give the barometer the.

5
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.460
So what we will do in the fine in this matter, we will find empty cells.

6
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.880
If the player clicks on a mind cell, the game is over.

7
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.690
If it clicks on a cell, it doesn't do the mind.

8
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:49.230
He or she uncovers a number indicating how many times the cell is a decent little clink.

9
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.250
Okay, so.

10
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.970
Okay, so we have to find we already find the cell is a decent.

11
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.330
So the next thing which we can clicking on an empty cell leads to uncovering many other empty cells,

12
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.030
plus cells with a number that form a border around the space of the empty border.

13
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.010
And what we will do, we use a recursive algorithm to find the empty cells here.

14
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.010
So here I will write here.

15
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.530
Firstly, we need to create some variables.

16
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.080
We will write current.

17
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.930
Column.

18
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.820
I will take G more no more columns here.

19
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.100
And next, another local variable which you need in self.

20
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.940
So here I will take the conditions first.

21
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.510
Here I will write current column.

22
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.470
This one should be greater than zero.

23
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.430
Under that we will define self is equal to j minus number of columns.

24
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.740
Here the number of columns here should be less than to one here.

25
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:15.330
One next condition will be said is greater than or equal to zero.

26
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.230
So what we will do, we will take the flow, the field and give the.

27
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.900
Settle here, which will take three, which will check it is greater than the mindset.

28
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.700
So here we're doing light field with the sun here minus equal to.

29
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.890
Forward for sale.

30
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.510
And don't not take another F condition here and put it to the field.

31
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.520
Sell is equal to empty sell.

32
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.510
And the good with the recursive do the recursive thing again.

33
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.290
Call back to find empty cell and give that parameter to the cell here.

34
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:28.080
After that, we have to do this thing again with the G minus one when the cell is set to the G minus

35
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.920
one here.

36
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.350
What should we do?

37
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.680
And I will write that again if cell is greater than equal to zero here.

38
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.680
So what we do if field cell is greater than mine.

39
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.780
Q Just a second here.

40
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.500
It should be greater than mindset here.

41
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:10.220
And what can we do will take with the similar previous one the fuel cell minus equal to over four cell

42
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.940
here.

43
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:21.620
None take another condition with the field cell and is equal to empty cell or not.

44
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:30.230
Just call back the recursive and put the parameter with the cell here.

45
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:42.380
After that next thing, which can we with the lowest number of columns and one less than two that here

46
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:51.890
I will write cell is equal to g plus number of columns should be less than one here and now.

47
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.790
What we will do, we will go with the previous one here.

48
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.720
So cell should be less the not the greater than with the all cells here.

49
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:19.900
And after that if condition what I will write here we will write is free cell greater than minus.

50
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.150
And we need the mind set here.

51
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.820
Here's the mindset.

52
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.250
What we will do.

53
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:44.640
We will take the field at the cell and minus equal to the cover of code for four cell here if condition

54
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.600
or field cell.

55
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.260
Is equal to empty cell or not.

56
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.860
And recursive call mark with the find empty cell with the parameter cell here.

57
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:09.580
So after this, what we are doing in this code, we check the cell that is located to the left to an

58
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.480
empty cell.

59
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.490
In this, if it is not empty, it is uncovered.

60
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.430
If it is empty, we repeat the whole process by recursively calling the find empty cells method.

61
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.240
So we need to do one more time.

62
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.910
We have to do for another five.

63
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.240
Once we already done the three, once we have the eight.

64
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.020
Right.

65
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:44.180
So okay, I now decide this one find okay and calls minus one.

66
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:52.180
Now we have to do four and G minus and columns, total number of columns.

67
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.510
So here all of this.

68
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.890
We will try to is equal to minus.

69
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:08.170
We know the right number of columns.

70
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:15.410
Then and here I will write if this is greater than zero.

71
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.180
What we will do, we will take with the similar cases.

72
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.750
And here I will write field with the sun.

73
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:33.890
Here is greater to mine cell here and go up with the field cell.

74
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.030
Minus is equal to cover for sale.

75
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.990
Done.

76
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.650
Take it with the f condition of.

77
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.920
Feel Shell.

78
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.320
Check it with the empty cell.

79
00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.910
And I'm just recursively called back of the find empty cell matter with the parameter cell here.

80
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.590
Okay.

81
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.230
So this is done after this.

82
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.880
We will check it with the ad columns to the numbers.

83
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:19.080
So here I will write equal to G plus number of columns here.

84
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:26.430
So if your cell is lesser than all cells.

85
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.020
So here.

86
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.750
I will do if.

87
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.350
She'll sell greater than mine.

88
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.520
Sell here.

89
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:47.790
So take it with the field cell and 32 minus equal to cover for all here.

90
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:49.920
Forward for sale.

91
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.640
Sorry.

92
00:08:50.730 --> 00:09:00.510
So after that, need another if condition field sell is equal to empty sell.

93
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:09.750
And then what we will do, we will write the fine empty cells callback and give the parameter to the

94
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.650
cell here.

95
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.890
These are the no we have adopted to.

96
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:17.930
Okay.

97
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.560
We have done this thing.

98
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.760
We have.

99
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.060
Don't we need to go with our two?

100
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.920
So here I will take the current moment.

101
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:43.350
So if current column is less than the number of columns minus one here, what should we write?

102
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:52.540
Send is equal to three minus the estimated number of columns here.

103
00:09:52.750 --> 00:10:04.540
Add the one I did with the one here and check with the condition itself is greater than equal to zero.

104
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.640
So what should it do?

105
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:19.630
It will go with similar previous condition field with the cell check it is greater than mine cell and

106
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:33.480
then field the cell ticket and minus equal to the cover for cell convert for cell, take the under if

107
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:41.110
condition for the field cell to be cell or not.

108
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:50.410
So recursive call back of the find empty cell method with the parameter cell here and now after that

109
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.610
or next conditions here.

110
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:57.880
Here.

111
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:11.730
Okay, so in this stage, the cell is equal to G plus the number of columns plus one here and on the

112
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:20.080
other if condition here, if cell is less than equal to all, no, only less than to all cells.

113
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.540
So here, what we will do.

114
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.270
We will take the field.

115
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.320
Cell is greater than mine.

116
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:40.930
Cell on the field cell minus E equal to cover for cell here.

117
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:47.260
Then if field cell.

118
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:57.690
Is equal to the empty cell phone, not the recursive call back of the find.

119
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.230
Empty cells matter with the parameter cell here.

120
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.120
So we have done this thing for the last.

121
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.420
So we.

122
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.800
We are left with our last condition.

123
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:20.450
Here, the cell is equal to the G plus one, and then we need F.

124
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.290
To sell is less than all sales.

125
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.460
And it should be.

126
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.420
If.

127
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.020
Feel sense.

128
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.680
Only sin is greater than mine.

129
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.010
Said this one.

130
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.450
Then we'll sell.

131
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.330
Minus is equal to power for all, power for sale.

132
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.270
And then it should check it with the field sale is equal to the seller not.

133
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:08.440
So here we right field cell is equal to empty cell.

134
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.420
And here we will recursive callback onto this sense method.

135
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.180
Here are the parameters cell.
