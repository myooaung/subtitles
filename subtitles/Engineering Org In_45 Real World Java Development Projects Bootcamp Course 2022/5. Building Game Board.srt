1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:00,780
Okay.

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:10,940
So we have done this thing and we will create this t adapter class in under this class so that what

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,030
we will do the and the to determine the actual position of the volume shape.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:30,530
So we will take the methods named as the private int square width parentheses and take it to a curly

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,370
bracket.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:41,840
In this matter we will write the return type across to the end and right correct size.

7
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,400
Don't get rid.

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,330
And what this does will be about board width.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,280
This will be border it and create locally.

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,820
No, no, no, no.

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,720
Just a second.

12
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,840
What we will do.

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,290
This.

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,530
Will you go with the director?

15
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,040
First, we have to do one more thing.

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,250
Take the square height as well, so we will drive the private in.

17
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,030
Square.

18
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,440
We need the height of it.

19
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:36,230
So we will write the square height, the span, Suzanne, and simply return with the type typecasting

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,750
to the end and write get size, not parentheses.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,070
It returns the size of the component.

22
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:58,640
We have to run in the get height and this will be the board height.

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,540
Sorry.

24
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,430
Okay.

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,730
So this thing is done.

26
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,070
Who would?

27
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:26,290
We have what we have done the correction already to my electrical wiring batteries the following datasheet.

28
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:36,400
So these lines determine the width and height of a single terminal score with the board width and the

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,100
board height.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,370
So what we will do?

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,840
We determine the shape at the given coordinates.

32
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,980
The shapes are stored in the board.

33
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,800
So what do we have to do?

34
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,760
We will write the private.

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,080
They draw money, right?

36
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,420
That draw.

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:15,920
So that ruminant animals chefs shepherd and provide a parameter index comma in why and what we have

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,240
to return return board.

39
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:34,180
Here we will write y, multiply the bold immutable first and then right

40
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,910
after this plus x and this is done.

41
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:51,820
Okay, now another thing which we have to do must we will write the start method from which our gain

42
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,960
will be the start.

43
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,680
So here we determine the shape and the given coordinates.

44
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,870
The shapes are stored in the board area.

45
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,030
Now we will write void

46
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,100
bracket open.

47
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,620
No, we create a new current shape on the new board.

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:23,950
So what we will do here, we will write the piece I think would be equal to a new shape.

49
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,570
This one.

50
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,700
And after this, we will write board.

51
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,230
Well, the new terminal.

52
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,940
The terminal here we have to.

53
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,650
Right.

54
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,790
We the board.

55
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:52,090
Firstly, we need to know, firstly, we need to hydrate the bore, hide or whatever.

56
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,150
I don't have to.

57
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,480
So we will write board height in the board width.

58
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,540
So.

59
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,830
Board height and the board width and simply close this.

60
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,810
And so the board is what we have to the board have to be clear and the new volume pieces initialize

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,460
so we will write clear board.

62
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,900
Then write clear piece as well.

63
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,060
And this thing is done.

64
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,660
Of course we have to initialize.

65
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,480
We have to write the method this.

66
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,350
We have to write the body of this method as well.

67
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,550
So what we will do?

68
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,840
Firstly, the board is clearer.

69
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,310
The new forming pieces initialized.

70
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,200
So before that we have to must try the body of the method post similar to the start.

71
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,640
So here we will write private void numerals.

72
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,600
The force.

73
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:16,500
With this we is we have to check is posed equal to the thing we is most sorry is almost done and we

74
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:28,920
have to check if it's passed and right under this status bar and we will set them.

75
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,850
I think we have to set that text.

76
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,510
So set text and write it to the.

77
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,130
Paused here after this.

78
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,700
We need the spot.

79
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,410
And into this spot.

80
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:45,830
We will.

81
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,550
Right.

82
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,650
Status bar.

83
00:06:51,260 --> 00:07:07,790
History does not set X and in doing this we will write string or the value of value off.

84
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,310
We need the nom lines removed.

85
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:21,950
This is done and we will create another method named as the repaint.

86
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,840
So this is done and we have to print.

87
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,900
So we have to set the graphics.

88
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,640
So this part is done.

89
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,900
And we have to.

90
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,640
Connect with the graphic part.
