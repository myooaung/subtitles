00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,900
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,750
So I hope that you all have went to the introduction of the application part and working off the project

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:16,050
part pretty well and have gained a rough idea about what this application is going to do.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,220
Basically, we are going to make a file browser with the help of Java, so there will be classes, objects,

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,810
methods calling and also we will be creating functions for each of the requirements inside the application.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,130
So let us start creating the application in our ID.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,910
So this is the welcome page of our favorite ID Visual Studio code.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,770
Inside this we are going to create our file browser interface application.

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,050
So in order to create the application, firstly we have to click on this explorer.

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,480
Here you can see the Explorer on the sidebar of your welcome window and hitting this Explorer button.

11
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,180
Our dialog box appears asking for options, so we have to create that Java project.

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,370
So we will click on this button.

13
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:19,800
Now our dialog box again asking for that type of build tool we are going to attach to our application.

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,660
So in this application we are going to work directly with the source code.

15
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,890
So we will be not like using any kind of tools.

16
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,840
Otherwise Java has built tools we can use whenever it is needed.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,830
You can study about the tools in detail, but in this project we are going to use this mobile tools

18
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,100
now our file tools of your desktop upper.

19
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,310
So you have to select a location where you want to save your project.

20
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:58,500
So I am going to select the project location as the desktop as I want to create the folder of the project

21
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,540
inside the desktop only so that it can it can be easily traceable.

22
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:11,160
Now on hitting the Select Project Location button input file depends on the we are like welcome window

23
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,600
of the ID asking for the input Java project name.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,260
So we have to input a Java project name for our application like it is going to be the name for the

25
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,790
folder inside the application is going to be consistent, so choose a wise name for your project.

26
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:37,680
Choose our name, which actually defines what that project is doing so that it can be easy for us to

27
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,760
like find that project in later future whenever we need.

28
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,120
Suppose we are creating a calculator application and we are naming it in a fancy manner or anonymous

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,630
manner.

30
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,800
So how we can find that calculator later whenever we will need it.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,010
So choose your device name for your application.

32
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:03,810
So I am going to name this application as file browser interface.

33
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,240
So yes, this is going to be the name for our application file browser interface.

34
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,910
On hitting Enter, we will end up inside the file browser interface folder.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,160
Yes, this is the welcome page of our file browser interface folder.

36
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,500
It is containing some inbuilt folders which are dot.

37
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,110
This dot.

38
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:35,410
We are Lebanese RC so we are simply going to ignore these two dot distant dot vs code folders.

39
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,710
These are created with the like the compiler.

40
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,770
Whenever we create a new project in Java, the compiler automatically create these two folders which

41
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,160
are like totally no use.

42
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,100
We are having no use of these two folders, so we are going to ignore these folders.

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,220
Now the main folder is the CAC folder.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,120
We are going to make our files inside this RC folder only.

45
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,620
So this is going to be the main folder.

46
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,430
And keep in mind that all the resources which are going to be required inside the application should

47
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,930
be added inside this RC folder only.

48
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,170
This is the main body of our project that starts the folder.

49
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,630
So all the body parts should be consistent inside this RC folder only.

50
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,860
So yes.

51
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,950
So we are like we have to add some of the images to our project.

52
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:40,170
So we will be adding that image folder inside this RC for also let us first create an IMG folder which

53
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,530
is going to create all the images.

54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,030
Also, I have created a file.

55
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:51,660
We have to create a folder deleting this and again creating all the new folder.

56
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,070
So we have to return the new folder option.

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,380
This is the image folder.

58
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,530
Now all the images are going to be consistent inside this.

59
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,640
I am the folder.

60
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:10,890
Now let us create our new class or we can say that a new file, which is going to be the main file of

61
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,850
our file browser, which is going to be responsible for testing and running of the application and also

62
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,610
containing all the functions of the application.

63
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,220
So in this application there will be only one file which really will be containing everything.

64
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,550
So naming the file as file browser or Java.

65
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:43,170
We should must attach dot java to the names of the file in order to make this file re-enable in Java

66
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,300
language and attach Java components inside this file.

67
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,590
So yes, we have created this file browser dot java.

68
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,780
It will carry a class public class.

69
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:08,940
File browser, and inside this public class we will be attaching the objects and the functions.

70
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,020
So public class file browser we have created.

71
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,360
Now we will extend this.

72
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,820
To a panel.

73
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,240
So, yes, we have extended this to Japan.

74
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,540
And this panel is a component of Java Swing Library, so it is automatically imported.

75
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,330
That is this is a journal component of this swing library.

76
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:50,040
Now, inside this class, we will be initializing some of the objects, such as public static final.

77
00:06:52,570 --> 00:07:00,490
So in order to like initialize the objects or the variables globally, we need to import some of the

78
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,150
libraries from the AWP or the string packages.

79
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:12,760
So those components are border layout, color component, desktop dimensions, flow layout.

80
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,980
And you can see that these are from the Java DOT AWP library.

81
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:27,040
Now a few of the events from the Java dot dot event package, these are actually an event action listener

82
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,520
component.

83
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,890
Listener, we have already discussed about it in the working of the application path that we will be

84
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,030
attaching functionalities for key listeners and mouse adapters.

85
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:44,470
Now the few of the components from the Java dot IO package, whether it be the buffer editor, buffer

86
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,000
writer.

87
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,510
So we are going to use the read and write feature for our text files.

88
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,990
So that package should must be imported first.

89
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,380
Also the file reader and the IO exception.

90
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,300
So in case any kind of exception arises.

91
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,820
Input output exception.

92
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:07,630
Then this is going to catch and show the error so that we can debug that error accordingly.

93
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:15,010
Also, we will be using the button frame and jailable are extensive use of these things are going to

94
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,960
be done and they are from the string library.

95
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,030
Now also we are having this scroll pane.

96
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,140
We have a horizontal and vertical scroll pin.

97
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,710
We will be having a text field and ag3, which is the most important thing.

98
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,270
Also the file chooser is opening the string three.

99
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,880
So we will be using the three component.

100
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,880
So the string three should be a mutable three note.

101
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:45,940
We are like changing the three color continuously adding folders, deleting folders.

102
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,220
So that should be a mutable three note.

103
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:55,210
And these are all the packages which are going to be required inside our application.

104
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:04,060
So we have imported all of them now inside the file browser class, which we have extended as a G panel.

105
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:12,430
The global variable which are needed to be like declared initially are a public static, final long

106
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,380
serial version.

107
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:19,810
You ID at J frame a G panel for the display panel and the show panel separate.

108
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:26,110
So we have like two panels, a display panel and a show panel and a J button.

109
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:33,100
So we are having four buttons, rename, add, add file and folder and return button and also a save

110
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,670
button.

111
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:40,660
So this return button is for the back button, which is like navigating us to the previous window.

112
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,760
Now a footer for label.

113
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,860
So that is our footer info.

114
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,540
We are containing a footer label, a mutable tree node.

115
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,740
So this is going to be contained a parent and a child.

116
00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:02,640
So initially we have to open the computer node by default, which will be containing the seed drive.

117
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:10,270
And our route to those are basically that computer is going to be the root of the tree, the tree model

118
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:19,020
and the tree, of course, and the text field for the scroller, for the tree and the Chopin.

119
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:26,560
So there was a vertical scroll and a horizontal scroll like this and the vertical one like this.

120
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,250
So we have to like initialize that scroll pane.

121
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:38,380
Also, we are initializing a string for the current folder of the folder which is selected so that it

122
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:46,030
can display the part of that, part of that folder or return the height for the frame, a file system

123
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,700
view and a J text area, of course.

124
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:55,090
So these were all the variables which are going to be required inside the application.

125
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,340
Now in the next part, we are going to create a constructor called Build.

126
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:09,340
So basically this is a function build not we can call it a function, not a constructor.

127
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,180
So public void build.

128
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:20,020
And inside the build function we are going to set the size for the frame which is going to like appear

129
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,430
on the opening window.

130
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:29,260
So basically this build function will contain the look for the application, the UI of the application.

131
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,190
So initializing a frame in like in the first part.

132
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,830
So new frame for the file browser.

133
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,440
So yes, this is going to be the name for the title.

134
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,660
We can see that.

135
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:57,570
Now, inside this frame, we have to set the size for the frame, of course, on the out of the frame.

136
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,360
So our frame not.

137
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,260
Said Preferred size.

138
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,330
And that is going to be a new dimension.

139
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,260
So new dimension.

140
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,320
And.

141
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,770
There will be a return the height.

142
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,860
With my height.

143
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,280
So, yes, this is how it is declared.

144
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:34,400
Now, in the next part, we have to set the size so frame not set size.

145
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:46,290
And the size is going to be like adjusted according to the dragging, like we can say the frame according

146
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,220
to our use.

147
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,270
So frame don't get preferred size.

148
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,650
There is no forced size for the frame.

149
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,700
We can change it accordingly.

150
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,530
The next thing for the frame is the like location relative.

151
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,990
So the location for the frame.

152
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,010
So frame.

153
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,380
Dot set location.

154
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,230
Now.

155
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,200
That location relative.

156
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,210
And the argument inside it is going to be null.

157
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:36,260
So yes, this is how the frame layout is decided and we have to pack the frame.

158
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,670
So if we do not pack the frame, then the full size of the frame will not be visible.

159
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,960
So this was for the layout of the frame.

160
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:57,290
The next thing is to set the exit and close function, set the from frame to resizable to to like.

161
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,670
Initially, the resizable thing is set to false by default.

162
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,480
So we have to set it to true.

163
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,940
We have to set focus able to true and give a background color to the frame as black.

164
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,040
Okay.

165
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,460
So this is going to be the layout of the frame.

166
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,030
This is going to be the operations like attached to the frame.

167
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:26,230
That is our I can attach file for JPG, which is going to appear in the taskbar for the application.

168
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:34,300
So whenever the application opens, the specific image, we have this image inside our image folder.

169
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:42,010
So yes, this file for jpg is going to be up there in the taskbar and the title bar of course.

170
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:49,210
So we have like attached all the images which are going to be required inside this application, whether

171
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:55,600
it be the back backed jpg, the background which we are going to attach.

172
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:04,030
The main background was this download the jpg, which is going to be the background of the application

173
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,900
and everything.

174
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,480
So coming back to the coding part.
