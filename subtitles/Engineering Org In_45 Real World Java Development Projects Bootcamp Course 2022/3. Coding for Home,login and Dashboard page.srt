1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:07,970
So here is our hotel management system dot java file which will the first file which you run.

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,020
In this project.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:18,420
So it is defined inside the package hotel and we have imported abstract window toolkit package, swing

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,370
package and event package that is defined inside the Abstract Window Toolkit.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,360
Now Abstract Window Toolkit and Swing will be used to generate and develop graphical user interface

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,740
standalone applications.

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,240
Now we have defined the class which is extending j frame j frame will be used to frame the designing

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,200
of our window.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,650
And this hotel management class had implementing action listener.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,460
Excel Listener is an interface whose method will be redefined in this class so that the event handling

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,570
can be performed.

12
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,970
Now there is two instance variable versus jailable that is L one second is J button, that is B1.

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,690
Now we have defined a non parameterized constructor of this class that is hotel management system and

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,370
setting the size of the j frame.

15
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,580
This is will be the size of the j frame layout of the j frame setting as null and the location of the

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:24,940
j frame from which it will start displaying that we have set using the set location and initializing

17
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:32,650
the new J label that will be 11 with null values and the button with new J button that will be labelled

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:39,760
as next and setting the background color of button and the foreground color of button as white and black

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,810
respectively.

20
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,000
Image icon that will create an image icon class loader.

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,090
Get system resource using the system resource.

22
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,210
It will create the image icon.

23
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:57,880
Now image will get the image from the image icon and the scales its default and size as well.

24
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:05,440
Now then again, image icon will create image icon by using the image object that is three.

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,070
And now the label has been created by using the image icon.

26
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:20,050
So the limit label will show that image now created a new label that is labeled as hotel management

27
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,090
system, setting the bound for it.

28
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,560
The first value is the X value.

29
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:32,470
Second is Y value from the start, and the third and fourth values are height and width of the.

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:33,950
Label.

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,530
Then we have set the font, family type and size of it, the label and the foreground color of the label

32
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,260
and adding that label to the L1.

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,870
Then we have set the bond for our button and label both adding the lib button to the label and adding

34
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,000
the label to the frame, adding action listener to our button, setting the visibility of the window

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,690
as true.

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,650
So while true, we will set the visibility of ID as false so it will an infinite loop.

37
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,100
Set the visibility of lead as false leads hotel management system.

38
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:15,210
So this will be setting as false and try to thread dot sleep 500 so thousand is equal to one second.

39
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:22,980
So that means 500 will it will blink for every half, second, half, second it will set as false and

40
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,890
every after half second it will set as true.

41
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,730
So it will it will display and disappear one by one.

42
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,880
Now this will catch oxygen will handle the catch.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,150
Then after that we have set it as true again.

44
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:43,860
We have settings thread 500 so it will again blink for the half second and catch will handle the exception

45
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,910
inside action performed as there is only one button that is next button.

46
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,350
So it will take us to the clicking of the next button will take us to the login page.

47
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,190
Setting the visibility of this window will be false and setting the visibility of the login page as

48
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,570
true.

49
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,190
Inside the main function we have created the management object and setting the visibility of the object

50
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,510
as true.

51
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,420
So let's move to our login page, which will be displayed when we click on next button of this page.

52
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:17,220
So login page is defined inside the package hotel imported the AWG Abstract Window Toolkit Package Swing

53
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,320
Package Abstract Measure Toolkit Event Package and SQL Package for Database Connection.

54
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,430
Define the class which is extending the frame and implementing acceleration.

55
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,890
There are two labels element and two one text field t one and password field TX two two buttons p one

56
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:37,530
and B to define the non parameterized constructor of the login class super logging which will be headed

57
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,800
as login setting the layout of the frame which will be null.

58
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,880
First frame is labeled as username.

59
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,560
First label will be user named as username, setting the bound for the label.

60
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,500
Adding that label to the frame second label is named as password, setting the bound for the password

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,450
and adding that label to the frame.

62
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,890
Similarly we have initialize the text field setting the bound for the text field and adding a text field

63
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,710
to the frame.

64
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,530
Similarly, for the password field, setting the bound for the password field and adding it to the frame.

65
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,100
Similarly, we have defined here the image.

66
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,650
Again, that is a second or jpg from getting the system resource.

67
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,380
The image will be.

68
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,300
It scaled by using the image object that is A2 which will get image and a scale is instance, size and

69
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,140
scaling.

70
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,390
Image three will create the image.

71
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,310
Icon will create the image icon by using the image object that is A2 and.

72
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,720
Creating another label, L3, which will show that image.

73
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,700
Setting the bond for the label and adding that label to our frame.

74
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,700
Then we have created the button log in labelled as log in, setting the bound for the button, setting

75
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,230
the font for the button, adding action listener to the button, setting background colour as black

76
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,070
and white for the foreground cloud of the button as white.

77
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,990
Adding that button to our frame.

78
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,860
Then we have B2.

79
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,090
That is another button named as cancel, which will be used to cancel the login.

80
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,550
Setting the bounds for the button.

81
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,150
Adding the font type family and its size foreground color as.

82
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,060
So the background color as black and foreground color as white and adding that bit of button to our

83
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,690
frame.

84
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:26,320
Now be to add extra listener this will adding the action listener to our button now get content and

85
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,690
setting the background color of our complete frame window as white, setting the visibility of the window

86
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,840
as true, setting the size of the frame and the location of the frame inside the action performed as

87
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,530
there are two buttons b1 b2.

88
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:47,500
So if the source of the event from is B2 B1, then we will stabilize the connection with our connection

89
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,970
class and database and take the text as a string you from the username field and from the password field.

90
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,300
It store the string in B creating a string variable Q which will hold the query.

91
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,640
That is a select aspect from login where username is equals to you and password is goes to re executing

92
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,160
the query by using a result set object rs seven point se dot execute query q passing the string which

93
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:20,410
is holding the query and if asked next to asked next will iterate will bring the record for them from

94
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,460
the next row of the login table and a new dashboard dot set as well.

95
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,820
So if the RS start next is executed successfully, then we will move on to the next page setting by

96
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,590
the visibility of the dashboard page as true and setting the visibility of the current page as false.

97
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,040
And if it does not match us with our database record so it will show the dialog box as added log in

98
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,930
and setting the visibility of the current window as false catch bug will be used to handle the exceptions.

99
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:55,310
And as if if the source of the event is from the be too button, that is a back button or cancel button.

100
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,920
So this will simply systematize it.

101
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,970
It will close for the complete program as the log in module will be canceled.

102
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,040
And inside the main function we have just created the log in object.

103
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:13,610
Let's move on to the dashboard class which will be displayed after the successful login.

104
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,930
So here is the dashboard class defined inside the package hotel.

105
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:26,590
And first we have imported the Java Abstract Window Toolkit Package and Java Swing dot package and Java

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,970
.8. event package.

107
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,040
Define the class, which is extending the frame.

108
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,770
And a public static void went inside the void.

109
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,170
When we have created the object of the current class and setting the visibility of it's as true.

110
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,420
Now we have defined the constructor headed as total management system.

111
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,140
Setting the foreground color as can and setting the layout as null.

112
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,990
Again, adding an image is scaling its size and.

113
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:06,580
For instance, adding that image to the image icon, adding that image icon to the label and setting

114
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,430
the bound for the label and adding the label to our frame.

115
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,570
Creating another label as airline management system that is headed as the Taj Group welcomes you.

116
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,160
That's for reference.

117
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:25,340
Airline management system setting the foreground color of it, that label font of that label bound off

118
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,130
that label and adding that label to our frame.

119
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,510
Now there is a menu bar instantiating the instance of a menu bar as menu bar setting the menu bar passing

120
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:44,000
by, bypassing the object of the menu bar that is menu bar and creating the menu object instance by

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,490
airline system that is added at hotel management.

122
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,130
So for our first item will be hotel management of that menu, setting the color for that foreground

123
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,700
of that menu and adding that menu to the menu bar.

124
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,420
Another menu item will be reception.

125
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,320
So menu item, first menu item will be reception and adding airline add flight details.

126
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,400
So that will be added to our menu.

127
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:16,430
Now second will be admin setting the colour for the admin and adding that admin menu item into our menu.

128
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,180
Well now another menu item will be added employ and adding the add employer to the admin section.

129
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,140
So admin will be able to add those employee.

130
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,410
So add employee will be inside the admin section.

131
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,230
Now flight details shallow one.

132
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,980
So five little settlements means adding employees will add employers click so that this portion of code

133
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,400
will be for whenever add employee event will happen.

134
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,430
So inside which we have defined action performed which is taking action event try.

135
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,200
If the add employee will be called, then we will call the add employee class and setting the visibility

136
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,500
of it.

137
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,010
True.

138
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,180
If any exception occurred, then we will handle those that exception.

139
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,820
Similarly, we have added add room inside the admin section at room inside the admin section.

140
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,860
Similarly here we have also.

141
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,740
Define the action event.

142
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,010
If the ad run will be event happen, then we will call the ad room and settings will be visibility as

143
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:19,400
true.

144
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,100
Then we have a flight details action.

145
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,910
If flight details is clicked, then action event.

146
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,400
We will open the reception menu.

147
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,410
So if the reception menu will be clear, then we will set the visibility as true of the new ships and

148
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,040
object.

149
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,270
Now flight item.

150
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,660
Then another item is the add driver that will be inside the admin.

151
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:45,800
So similarly we have called the add driver class inside this action perform method whenever it will

152
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,380
be clicked or event that happen setting the size of it as.

153
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:58,090
It's off the window and setting the visibility as true and setting the background color of that window

154
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,870
as white.

155
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,930
Now, let's see how these three classes are interrelated.

156
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,200
So let me start with the hotel management system class, which is the basic class.

157
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,460
Let's run this file.

158
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,070
So it is running.

159
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,060
So this is how it will look like.

160
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,440
This is how it will look like.

161
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,000
Here is that red dot sleep which is blinking at every half second.

162
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,780
So let's click on Next Button, which will take us to the login page.

163
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,810
Next button, here is the login page.

164
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,540
As you can see, here is the login page username or we have already entered.

165
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,320
That was in the previous video admin and its password is one, two, three, four, five.

166
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,640
Let's hit login.

167
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,700
So login will take us to the this page that is heading as hotel management system and there are still

168
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,920
menu item, hotel management and admin.

169
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,410
I told you that inside admin add employee add rooms and add drivers inside hotel reception.

170
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,780
Now in our next video, we will.

171
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:06,780
Take a look on the admin portion that is an employee at and driver classes how these are these will

172
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,560
work.

173
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,790
So this in this video we have learned about these three classes.
