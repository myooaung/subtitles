1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.110
Our project is Java block system.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.150
We are going to create a one block which is a name as Connected Global and it is given a name given

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.750
by me.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.950
You can change another name, any other name.

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.760
It's not compulsory.

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.620
You can choose any other name, but I prefer the name as you connect to Blue in this block.

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.830
Or we can system.

8
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.960
What I'm going to do.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.200
I'm going to add some admins and I'm going to connect to people using Java.

10
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.510
Also, I just want to add one police station information.

11
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.430
Also, I also giving the information page for this server.

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.800
So nearby police station.

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.160
I'm going to try some logic behind this.

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.420
So.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.220
This project is based on GBK JSP, Java Servlet and the server deployment I am using here.

16
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.730
Ajax, I will tell you what is Ajax and each and every time later.

17
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.550
So our project is Java block system and we are going to create one block system platform.

18
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.980
We can say with the Java app basically.

19
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.660
So we are going to use that.

20
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.770
So our project is.

21
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.120
Basically develop a block system platform.

22
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.490
We are going to develop a block switching platform.

23
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.120
For the people around the globe using Java servlet technology.

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.880
So our is aim is very basic, but what we are going to develop, it's very important here because we

25
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.680
are performing with this Java.

26
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.640
So we need to write some Java servlet pages, we need to write some JSP pages and JavaScript also and

27
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.730
further consider your I.

28
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.260
I'm going to use some default images and some things to add and create one beautiful UI for my website

29
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.150
or we can web application with Java.

30
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.850
So I am using your database also.

31
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.320
I will tell you later how I'm going to use the database and how I am going to connect it to the my database.

32
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.380
So steps of over development is project setup.

33
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.680
I'm going to set up my project and how I'm going to deploy it.

34
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.900
Then understanding different tools because project setup is just not writing new code.

35
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.400
We need to mention all the libraries, each and everything.

36
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.260
Then understanding different tools.

37
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.630
What I'm going to use here, what is the different tools I'm going to use here?

38
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.410
What is the significance of CSS files here?

39
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.600
Each and every time I'm going to mention here.

40
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.490
Then some Java basics.

41
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.080
You should know the Java basics.

42
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.550
I will teach you the Java basics.

43
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.560
Also here, what I'm going to perform.

44
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.210
But sometimes due to time constraint and each and everything, I'm going to use some default quotes

45
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.370
that will I will explain later, but use that then basics of database.

46
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.180
What is the database and what is the skill statements I'm going to use here?

47
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.500
I'm going to use your relational database, no special database like noise database.

48
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.700
I'm not going to use it.

49
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.630
I'm going to use your only relational database with the relational queries, some JSP basics, then

50
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.080
Java servlet and database, GBC connections and deployment on the server when you deploy it on the server.

51
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.040
So that's it.

52
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.570
Our steps of development.

53
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.490
So just recall those types of development projects better understand the different tools used the basics,

54
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.430
basics of database, JSP Basics, Java, servlet and GDB C connection and deployment on the server.

55
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.580
So let us see the what is the things I'm going to use here?

56
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.830
What are the requirements each and everything.

57
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.800
So application requirements.

58
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.580
Let me tell you, what is the application requirements?

59
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.540
Not always.

60
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.870
Our requirements are specified with our code or anything.

61
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.590
We need to mention the application requirements also.

62
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.410
So Java program to display web content.

63
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.920
Basically, I'm not going to write total Java program.

64
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.980
The thing is, for that purpose, I'm going to create a connection and I'm going to tell you what I'm

65
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.630
going to do here and I'm going to write just one Java code here.

66
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.690
What is it?

67
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.310
So we can say pure Java code.

68
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.760
Other than this, I'm going to imitate the JSP or later in HTML files to write Java programs.

69
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.090
So Java programs, basic knowledge, also basic concepts of skills.

70
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.830
So you should know the basic knowledge of Java.

71
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.700
If you have some prior knowledge of a skill also it will be very beneficial while developing this project

72
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.970
because I'm not going to explain the age and everything.

73
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.670
Yeah, I'm just giving the overview of this.

74
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.890
Then some Java basic concepts.

75
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.850
Also, I'm going to tell you here is HTML and this is frontend.

76
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.120
I'm not going to tell each and every part of HTML.

77
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.060
I will try to explain that, but I will tell you you can use your bootstrap also for the better group.

78
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.530
I'm not going to use your bootstrap, but I'm just telling you you can use bootstrap and also website

79
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:04.040
for log in admin or you learned or you can say as a part of you you can use student.

80
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.430
But I'm mentioning as admin only you can change it to the people also who log in here.

81
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.610
So let me tell you, you can use it as a people.

82
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:22.070
Also, I'm considering this is for students only, so that is common people for admin due administrative

83
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.750
actions and for the common people.

84
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.740
These are the two users or you can say use cases of our application.

85
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.890
We will require JDK 1.8 Why?

86
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:39.410
I'm telling JDK 1.8 is the Glass Glossary servers and Java E version in our case is towards JDK 1.8.

87
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.370
You can use JDK 16 also it will support it is NetBeans I'm going to use here and Oracle databases my

88
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.450
relational database.

89
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.310
You can choose Gillespie server, you can directly import to your file.

90
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.660
No need to check for that or you can check for ID.

91
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.920
So that's our application requirements.

92
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.780
Let's see our functional requirements.

93
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.560
What is the functional application I'm going to use here?

94
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.170
Functional requirements post is admin.

95
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.680
There are few admin roles here.

96
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.950
I'm going to suppose you post this can create an post topic to be discussed and report respectively

97
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.390
after getting logged in.

98
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:28.250
So basically it can pose the topic or report of that delete report like some abusive matters or explicit

99
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.580
content.

100
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.870
You can delete that report or we can post can view all reports topics to be discussed.

101
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.670
You can search post and you can check.

102
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.580
I'm considering your police station as the reports also.

103
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.680
So that part also you can handle.

104
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.890
Help in any report to pursue further.

105
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.630
Give it to the media, etc..

106
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:55.830
You can do or can view the previously posted comments post on comments on each report or topic.

107
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:04.830
So what it can be handle it can offer is that there is a city ABC and in that city Y is a locator area

108
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.000
and that's very unsafe.

109
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So people can put that common people x, y, z area is very unsafe and they can pose the picture also.

110
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.510
So admin can give you that and it can inform to that police station, nearby police station.

111
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.890
So I am considering this scenario.

112
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.990
You can choose any other.

113
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.630
So this block system is two way.

114
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.950
It can be reporting matter also for the reporting matter and for the smart city.

115
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:35.790
But also you can use so common people can view all the reports after going getting login search and

116
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.380
report the police station like I need to report the police station.

117
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:48.080
It's not very useful in case file emergency but you can report through this platform also can view previously

118
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.650
posted comments and post on comments each and everything you can check.

119
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.840
So that's it about the functional requirements.

120
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.370
So in the next part, I'm going to tell you what is the solid basics?

121
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:06.470
But before that, what I'm going to explain is here is I'm going to explain the setup of our project.

122
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.640
So this is mine.

123
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:14.330
It means once you have installed the NetBeans, I'm using 12th version and it means you can check for

124
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.080
stable version.

125
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.730
You can look like this.

126
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.880
Or there is one new window also for you.

127
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.010
What is needed here?

128
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.320
What to file three new project.

129
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.480
So.

130
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.870
Once you hit a new project.

131
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.590
You can see this is my new project and you can see Java Web or do web application.

132
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.010
Next, you can choose the location.

133
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.360
I'm.

134
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.030
Connect.

135
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.700
Look.

136
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:56.500
So I'm putting like this Connect Globe, you can use dedicated library for storing libraries.

137
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.390
So I'm mentioning this heat index.

138
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:07.460
You can choose server I to your server this next don't choose anything here because we are not going

139
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.050
to use here and click finish.

140
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.260
You can use Java server faces which are everything you can use.

141
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.500
That's not very matters here, but remember the thing I mentioned here?

142
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.500
So it will take time to check everything.

143
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.080
It will create the indexed HTML page for you.

144
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.310
Keep it as it is.

145
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.560
We are going with only JSP pages.

146
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.850
We are not including external pages as our front end part.

147
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:38.720
We are going with JSP pages because I don't want to write your Java code which connects to the HTML,

148
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.480
so I will embedded my JSP or we can say job accord in HTML only.

149
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.340
So it will be very helpful while developing the code.

150
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.800
So on the left side, you can see this and this is my code.

151
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.790
Let me zoom this.

152
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.190
So this is the default code which created all already to do, right?

153
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.900
Content to supply the content.

154
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.280
Everything you can see.

155
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.670
On this.

156
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.260
You can check the projects here.

157
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.780
Once you click this, it will load the file.

158
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:13.220
You can see the here is libraries file, source packages, file with packages, file configuration files.

159
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.650
If you want to add JDK, you need to install the Java X file.

160
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.970
Also, let me add that Java folder inside my listings.

161
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:29.990
Let me add a Java X which is basically contains Java because while developing this, I understood that

162
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.280
my JDK doesn't contain this or does not contain this Java X Java.

163
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.620
So if you want, you can download it from the web.

164
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.590
It's freely available and just hit enter.

165
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:45.530
It will load that file so it will take time to load that very once it is loaded.

166
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.660
You can see here that's left.

167
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.350
Also, you need some database connectors for the oracle.

168
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:58.580
You need GBC, Oracle GBK Connector 14.10 according to your GDC or Oracle version.

169
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.250
And for my skill you need my spell connector.

170
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.080
So that's it for the setup.

171
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:10.250
If you want to check whether it's running or not, what you are going to do, click, click on this

172
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.630
connect loop, right click.

173
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.880
You can see many options here.

174
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.860
Click, hit, clean and build.

175
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:23.060
So if your output window is not opening, what you are going to do, click window, click here output

176
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.840
so you can see the output window.

177
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.410
So you can use this as output.

178
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:41.850
So let me drag it in because this is my coding area and I can check output from here only.

179
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.490
So let me just.

180
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.150
Okay.

181
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.060
So this is my output thing.

182
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.530
And you can see Billy successful if you want to run.

183
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.520
What you are going to do.

184
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.480
Click here.

185
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.380
Enter, run.

186
00:11:53.010 --> 00:12:02.580
So it will move to the directly and then say blast server visiting the references connect global is

187
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:10.140
running and really successful when this is when this is done you can check this is my global localhost

188
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.550
2002 or if your code is 88 localhost, go to your.

189
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:22.530
Before domain XML in blast free server and change 82 to 2002.

190
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.580
Because what happens?

191
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.220
Oracle Database Service is also 88.

192
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:33.110
So it will move to the part that which is basically not very useful content.

193
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:39.660
I can see that added and this also blocks so simultaneously both can be run and there will be probably

194
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.250
more error when you are doing this.

195
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.310
So changes to the 2002 as I changed here.

196
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:53.430
So this is my ID and the successful not so that's it about how we can deploy this everything.

197
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.620
So this is basically just a servlet.

198
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.670
Let me close this.

199
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.850
So what I'm going to do.

200
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.110
You need to.

201
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.900
You don't need this indexed or HTML, but directly don't just delete this.

202
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.350
What are you going to do?

203
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:08.820
Click here.

204
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.570
Web pages.

205
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.590
Click New.

206
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.930
And let me.

207
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.880
Open this or the pages with New Jersey.

208
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.200
So when this is done.

209
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.550
New Jersey.

210
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.720
Change it to the index.

211
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.820
JSP because this is loading file.

212
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.500
Always remember index is basically for the load index and click here enter.

213
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:35.030
Once this is done you can check your index.

214
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.350
JSP is done and it will write content for you directly.

215
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.150
Let me be quite part.

216
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.680
What I'm going to do is.

217
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.960
In Page.

218
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.640
So let me.

219
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:02.310
So as soon as they start running, you can check here and let me delete this part.

220
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.960
So what you're going to do is click here, delete and delete this part, so it will delete it.

221
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:14.850
So if you go to this part, let me copy this because I'm going to.

222
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.480
We'll here.

223
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.390
Let me run this again.

224
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.890
Oh so you can check index or JSP pages, JSP pages and now running, which is contents helloworld.

225
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.720
So that's how we can develop a JSP.

226
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.740
We don't change the indexed JSP because it's in this file and though what we can say configuration is

227
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.970
loaded with index only.

228
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.390
So this is how I'm going to perform this.

229
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:52.020
So in the next part, what I'm going to mention here or what I'm telling you, we are going to perform

230
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.770
these actions.

231
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:58.470
I will explain the servlet part and I'm proceeding with the functional requirements.

232
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.310
I will check for each and every functional requirement step by step.

233
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:11.880
And I will tell you that within this section we are going to perform five administrative actions and

234
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.490
three common people actions.

235
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.230
As I mentioned earlier, with the functional requirements.

236
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:22.110
Before proceeding with the project, you should have some prior knowledge about Java and it's good.

237
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.100
So I will tell you what is the basics of servlet?

238
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.540
What is the basics of JSP in the later part of this tutorial?
