1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,660
So now we are fully developed with our code.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,300
So I will explain what I'm going to do here.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,050
So consider these all the libraries I'm going to use.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,750
But instead of this, I created one class, which is name as public class server.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:28,160
So while creating any application, client and server part are very important, like server is for the

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,500
catching all the part of clients in the chat system.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,410
So client is going to attach with server and to the server we are going to send the message.

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,570
That's the basic thing we are going to see here.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,980
So first I'm creating your vector using this syntax.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,230
So I will tell you what is the function here.

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,280
So vector is going to hold the instance of all the classes with the handlers.

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,500
So I'm creating your static vector with client handler.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,650
You can see as an object, which is reasonable.

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,530
I will tell you you can check your classes now this and extents to object and I'm giving the name as

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,130
socket.

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,120
So socket is just like electrical sockets client is going to attach there.

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:18,580
So I'm mentioning as a socket now to run any method in or for the running purpose, we need method which

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,520
is main method to running our server which is going to draw input output exception.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,700
That's a common exception we can find in server also.

20
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,260
Then server socket is I'm creating your socket with server socket.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,820
So you may ask me like what is this server socket?

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,880
So it is basically java dot net package.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,010
You can use your which is the default package in Java and you can use your server socket.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:54,360
Then I'm giving which is I'm going to later increment it later because I need to name the client's IDs

25
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,660
as one to incrementing.

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,730
So I'm currently giving as a zero.

27
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:04,060
Then it will print in command, prompt or console that it's waiting for connection.

28
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,160
Our server is waiting for client connection.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,960
Now current client count is depends on socket size.

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:18,850
If a while too, which is basically pinging the server or for the opening ports of server is always

31
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,290
true.

32
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,120
So server will always assert life on the network.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,080
So I'm considering network as not an internet.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,720
It's a network I'm considering as it's a loop of networks and server is always live there.

35
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:42,090
Then for that purpose I'm giving the file to then what is the significance between this system dot dot

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,570
println and what is this thing?

37
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,030
So basically current client count I'm giving as a sockets dot size.

38
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:57,700
So as a socket size our vector which is list here I'm using vector as a list here so we can use the

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,070
size as defining the client size.

40
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,110
Then socket connection.

41
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,250
I'm creating connection as object and which is going to accept the clients.

42
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,810
Then client IDs is going to plus one, which is basically I'm adding the client IDs here.

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,290
Then?

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,090
Print Writer I'm using your print writer output to get the output as an output stream connection point

45
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:28,220
output stream width then input stream I'm going to create here, which is buffer reader because clients

46
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,290
need to input and output both things.

47
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,590
So I need to mention that then this is client handler is going to hold some default things which is

48
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,610
basically client name or connection is basically our except connection.

49
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,970
Output is for output stream and input is for input stream.

50
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,190
Then add C is basically I'm going to add the client and you may ask what is this?

51
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:56,450
So this is the client handler and I created your thread and I'm starting the thread so via the thread.

52
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,410
So currently I'm deploying it on local.

53
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,770
So I'm going to specify clients on my own.

54
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm not going to disclose it later.

55
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:13,370
Like I'm not going to I'm going to choose only my own clients as my for this deployment.

56
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:21,740
But working on current systems of multi chat systems, you can assume that to clients wants to get connection

57
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,780
to the server at the same time.

58
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:31,970
Like if you call someone you may get busy, but while chat system you should not get that busy calls

59
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,020
in the server part.

60
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,960
So for that purpose we need to create thread so each client connection will be handling by a thread.

61
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,460
So thread is basically small part of process.

62
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,010
I told you earlier and I'm going to start here.

63
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:53,030
So this is just part of connection, but I need to print it out as a client, handler, methods and

64
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,510
everything.

65
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,860
So this is just for close streams and everything I created.

66
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:05,360
But for that purpose, what I'm going to create, I'm going to create your public run method to create

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,100
a one enable interface.

68
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,590
So again with try and catch block, I'm going to accept the exceptions.

69
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:19,160
But in the file too, I'm accepting the message with resume method and receive is basically input dot

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,370
read line, which is basically input stream method and client handler.

71
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,290
Again, the connection and I'm mentioning as well, this is as my constructor for client handler.

72
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,280
And this is for the renewable interface is going to class it's going to use here and for that purpose

73
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,880
I created.

74
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,450
So this is done with the server part.

75
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,180
So remember while giving the server, this is your server port.

76
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,600
I'm mentioning as 2020 as my server port.

77
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,070
Now let us see.

78
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,390
What is the client here?

79
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,830
Oh.

80
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,990
So forgot about all these things and let us see what I'm going to do.

81
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,180
So in the text field, I'm going to use our text chat window.

82
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,690
I'm going to mention I mentioned your two frames, f one and F two.

83
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,430
F one is just for putting the name and F two is full message, connection and everything I'm going to

84
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,120
specify.

85
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,130
Then I'm creating here for setup with string host as argument.

86
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,080
Then f one is new frame which server host and I'm going to assign it.

87
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:26,310
So I created your text area text field with the button and everything I explained to you and I'm just

88
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,810
giving a recap for this.

89
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:35,400
Then I created your bottom panel and everything, and the bottom panel is for the bottom purpose.

90
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm giving the bottom panel button also there for accepting the connections and everything.

91
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,410
Now let us see how we can run this.

92
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,500
So running is very easiest part here.

93
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,680
So first is I'm going to ping my server so.

94
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,910
For any purpose you need to run for server, then you can run clients.

95
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,060
So I'm now currently running my server.

96
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,640
So wait for some time.

97
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,460
It will give me the build and it will deploy my server.

98
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,200
Again.

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,520
Server is always live.

100
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,500
So it will accept connection at any time.

101
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:22,630
Like I'm not giving any or date time date time to server, so it will not at all stop for any time.

102
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,580
So it will always accept the clients.

103
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,890
So it's building.

104
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,530
Sometimes it may take time to build everything.

105
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,720
So it will take the resources and it will take everything.

106
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,880
It depends upon your system speed.

107
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:56,590
Without any like client methods or server methods, you cannot run any direct methods like.

108
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,180
Well.

109
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,860
So what needs to deploy force on your system or you can check on your local host.

110
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,450
So now build is successful.

111
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,100
My build is successful and you can check server is waiting for connection and current plan count is

112
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,730
zero.

113
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,780
That's usual.

114
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,790
I haven't created any client here.

115
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,770
Now let us move to my client and let me run client command here.

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,430
So if you can check here, I'm going to run my client, which is client start running.

117
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,770
I will tell you what is this host later.

118
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:40,070
But if I'm currently running on my local host so there is no errors I'm now getting because it's a direct

119
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,630
part.

120
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,110
So now you can check.

121
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,480
Currently my.

122
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,050
This is running.

123
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,760
And this is my.

124
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
Or client check system.

125
00:08:51,040 --> 00:09:00,530
So I'm mentioning as A, B, C as my name and I'm submitting it so it will open me the next things.

126
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,160
So this is my client when and if I pressed hi here.

127
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,910
So ABC will be hired.

128
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,190
Now why protocol mismatch.

129
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,910
I will tell you.

130
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,190
And what's I'm getting your error.

131
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,590
It will run on your localhost, no problem.

132
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,330
But the thing is, I'm mentioning as my defaulting.

133
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,820
So you can check here.

134
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,560
If I run again, it will give me another climb.

135
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,060
So currently it's giving me the error because of this host because I mentioned the host 60 TCP and you

136
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,840
and what is this?

137
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,620
I will tell you.

138
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,880
But the thing is, my client is not running on localhost.

139
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,220
It is running on some other interface.

140
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,080
And this is my server which is running on and client is not connected actually.

141
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,990
So that's an error in my program.

142
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:55,560
So how I'm going to use that because creating on a local machine, it's not very useful case for multi

143
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,690
thread chat system connection between establishing between two systems or between two friends.

144
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,780
Chatting with two friends is the full approach of this.

145
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,650
So let me stop all the processes here currently.

146
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,980
So it is getting stocked and you can check your like.

147
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,360
Let me stop this also.

148
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,840
This is a stop button you can check here and now I'm stopped.

149
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,980
So what is this?

150
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,850
I will tell you.

151
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,490
So indie rock is a free service.

152
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,120
You can check here.

153
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:34,590
Indie Europe is a free service which is useful to forward your network or for your local host on the

154
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,340
Internet.

155
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,800
So it's a local like exposing your local host on the Internet, but it's a secure channel.

156
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,130
It's not like any cybersecurity, but it is very secure in directing.

157
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,460
And you can connect to services and you can establish the connections from anywhere.

158
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,650
So I downloaded it for my system, which is basically for Windows.

159
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,870
I'm downloading it.

160
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,990
You can unzip and you can use different things or you can sign up also here with your IDs and login

161
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,510
utilities and you can pass your token also.

162
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,820
So let me move in this ID and let me show you how the engine off is going to work.

163
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,180
So this is the engine window once you open so you can check here.

164
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:26,010
Different, different ports are giving you an example already given HTTP, then TCP also given.

165
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:33,630
So my protocol is TCP, TCP, which is I'm going to use your TCP traffic to handle TCP traffic.

166
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,180
And what is my port?

167
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,390
It's basically 2020 my server port.

168
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:37,570
Right.

169
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,440
Is so let me mention this command engine PCB 2020.

170
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,970
So sometimes what thing I forgot is basically.

171
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,500
I haven't mentioned that or two or three things.

172
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,620
So let me open and you talk again.

173
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,400
So it will accept.

174
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,990
My thing.

175
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,610
So let me open it again because I haven't mentioned the Indigo Dot XY PCB.

176
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,150
And 2020.

177
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,080
So.

178
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,260
Okay.

179
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,760
So I'm getting the error as in your local port is not available, so.

180
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,250
Let me open it again.

181
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,700
And.

182
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,720
Let me check it again.

183
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,100
In zero.

184
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,530
DCB be.

185
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,720
20.

186
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,400
Okay.

187
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,960
Now my server is like, you can check here.

188
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,140
My server is low.

189
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,430
So this is the web interface.

190
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,560
You can check it later.

191
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,740
But what we required, we required this line.

192
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,460
So this is my TCP protocol.

193
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,890
Then this is my host IO till IO.

194
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,390
This is my host and this is my port.

195
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,980
So now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this part.

196
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,760
Well, you can copy the control.

197
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,320
See here, you can copy this.

198
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,760
Go to your ID.

199
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,130
You need to make changes to client only.

200
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,770
Let me print out this so I will use it later.

201
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,620
Now copy paste it.

202
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,390
So I will use it later.

203
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,800
And let me comment on this.

204
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,480
So it will not useful.

205
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,350
So what we need require we need to paste this six to this six so it will static always.

206
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,110
So I already mine is six only.

207
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,670
So I need to check this port and let me copy this.

208
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,940
And you need to mention about that, about the port, as I told you.

209
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,100
You need to change the port about.

210
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,260
So let me check.

211
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,440
Where is that all?

212
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,570
Okay.

213
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,020
So in the void connect to server.

214
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,450
I need to change the port to which I got.

215
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,800
Which is.

216
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,580
Basically this board, you can check your web interface and you can check for that purpose also.

217
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,020
But for me, it's going to work.

218
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,720
And now we are done.

219
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,920
Now we are done.

220
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,340
And now what I'm going to do is, as I told you, I need to run my server first.

221
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:38,960
When my server is running one 2020 port with the local host what it will be do in zero and drop pull

222
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:46,610
up that local host 2020 server request to that client part which is basically to this.

223
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,270
To this, it will pull up and now my client is now connected to this.

224
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,820
So basically server is running on my machine, but or it is connected to my machine.

225
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,680
So my machine is act as a server part, but client is not on my server.

226
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,240
So let me do one thing here in the client part.

227
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,110
Let me run this and let me show you how I'm going to use it.

228
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,600
So this is my client I'm going to use.

229
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,690
Yeah.

230
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,620
And which is I'm going to use in currently running currently client.

231
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:29,760
So it will take time to build once it is built, fully built, it will run the task and it will deploy

232
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,460
me one window, as you can see here.

233
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:38,060
So this is my window and let me mention his name, ABC here and let me submit this.

234
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,570
So now you can check connected to this IP, which is basically.

235
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,120
This bought this IP.

236
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,580
Now I'm connected connection and let me mention as high.

237
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,730
Now you cannot see your any messages like there is no error.

238
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,260
This is my build output.

239
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:02,740
But if I go to run part and if I go to server part, you can check my client when it's connected.

240
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,100
So I want to connect another client on my system only.

241
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,750
You can check with your friends.

242
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,780
Also, you can connect between two friends, but I need to deploy on my machine for that instance.

243
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,870
I need to edit the configuration here.

244
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:23,110
If you want to check, you need to install one plugin intel idea which is multi run plugin.

245
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:32,380
So go to plus icon here in order and debug configuration, then go to downward and check for multi run

246
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,490
as I'm doing here.

247
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,390
Multi run.

248
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,790
Let me view the name as.

249
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,860
Client one This is my client.

250
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,050
Let me add one thing.

251
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,430
Run client.

252
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,600
Which is my method.

253
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,480
Or don't give anything after launch and anything.

254
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,040
Click, apply and hit.

255
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,550
Okay.

256
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,880
So in this now you can check.

257
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,650
This is my main methods, but this is my multi run.

258
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,800
So what it will do, it will create an one another instances for client and it will call that so you

259
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,720
can the basic purpose of these things.

260
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,820
I can use another window also.

261
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:14,670
So currently in this you can check this is my ABC and this is my another window which is I'm going giving

262
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,570
the name X, Y, Z, and I'm entering this.

263
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:30,080
Now what you can check if I am quoting here by you can check your x y z also is printing by if I'm printing

264
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,800
here.

265
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,380
Hi x, y, z.

266
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,250
You can check.

267
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,270
I'm getting high x, y, z in another window.

268
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,460
So this is my x y z window and this is my ABC window.

269
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,150
And in the server this thing you can check the client counts.

270
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:51,080
So server is basically giving, not giving any view purpose because it's command line interface just

271
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,840
but for the clients I created when.
