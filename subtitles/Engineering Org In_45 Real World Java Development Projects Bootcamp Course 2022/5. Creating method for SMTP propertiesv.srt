1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:14,210
So in previous part what we have done, we create already created an index or JSP which is for the front

2
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,900
end part.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,820
Like this you have a mini client and we are importing some file years.

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,310
So we are importing this page.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,010
And what is page import is basically I am just accessing this mail hotmail client.

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,370
Why I'm putting mail because the package is mail here.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,620
As you can see, this complex, which is my own property, I will tell you later, what is this?

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:43,190
Basically, if you know this, this is just basically the injection dependency thing, dependency injection

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,940
I use here.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,540
So I use this as dependency part.

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:56,190
So while I'm putting this, you can see I'm accessing this mail dot client here and I already wrote

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,230
the program for this.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:05,240
So mail dot client is nothing but it's accessing its data or JSP through this and.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,880
This is going to indexing, so it will take them while indexing.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,290
So what I have done, let me tell you, as in previous with some short recap.

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,710
So what I have done here is it's very easy.

17
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,810
I have done here.

18
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,090
So.

19
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:41,900
These are the teams in decline and creating your OP string, which is basically then super keyword I

20
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:49,070
used as a constructor here to mention this is the constructor of this so you can minimize this as it

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,680
is perform that actions.

22
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,570
Sometimes indexing will take a little bit of more time.

23
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,220
But what you going to do?

24
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:05,120
You can just reload this from your dependencies and it will take part of that indexing.

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,280
Slater.

26
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,370
So.

27
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:09,990
The building.

28
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,040
So it's going to sink this application, as you can see, with the cloud.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,770
So we created this message and everything and it's going to dispatch and I'm using your two methods.

30
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,200
One is to post and one is to get.

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,040
So this is it about how we perform in male clients.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,950
So this is just for accessing the data and everything.

33
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,380
Then what is the more things?

34
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,220
I'm going to use your email, not this.

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,810
Let me do one thing here.

36
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,450
If we were to do 100 and.

37
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:58,460
What I'm going to do is you can just reload this because sometimes it takes more time indexing so you

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,570
can hide the process.

39
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:07,010
So it will take time, but I know I can proceed with my further, more indexing part time.

40
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,140
I don't want to stop for this.

41
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:17,450
So in this part, what I'm going to do, I'm going to create one more thing is email utility.

42
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,340
So let me copy this.

43
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,270
Okay.

44
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,440
I covered this part.

45
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,670
Now, let me go to the mail plan part.

46
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:37,480
What I'm going to do now is this clicking new Java class pasting this email utility thing under.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,890
So that's it.

48
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,550
It's created for me, this part.

49
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,620
So it will take time to indexing and doing everything here.

50
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,410
Sometimes it takes more time than this.

51
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,040
We are not worried about that part.

52
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,570
We will check it later.

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,150
Let us start with coding part.

54
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:11,840
So I already created this, but we are remaining with some final strings, which is basically SSL socket

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,410
factory.

56
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,640
We are going to factories just basically for factory resetting and doing everything part.

57
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,790
So let me go to the demo part and.

58
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,390
We go to the mansion.

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,330
But I read.

60
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,730
So let me mention one thing here is

61
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,680
this.

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,100
So I will tell you what is the significance of this?

63
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,010
So Cecil is just handling this.

64
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,030
So I'm mentioning this, but I will tell you later how it's going to work.

65
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,880
It's not actually, I'm putting as a comment here and why I'm commenting this part is I will tell you

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,070
later, this is just a sizzle factory.

67
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,250
I mention it, so that's not required at all.

68
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,660
But sometimes it's use more preferences for that.

69
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,980
Let me get one.

70
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,340
Private.

71
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,310
Stepping.

72
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,210
So I needed properties proper.

73
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,480
These props, you can now you can add anything.

74
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,770
So.

75
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,940
Sometimes it takes time, like you can check your background task or taking more time due to network

76
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,130
issues and more things it takes.

77
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,090
But we can do with this new.

78
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,350
Properties.

79
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,120
So these are the drama properties.

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,960
Then what I'm going to perform here is I'm going to create one static part.

81
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:10,470
So if you know, instead of putting main dot or we can see upstream upstream is common thing here I

82
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,990
will say public static environment.

83
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,870
If I put a stream.

84
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,260
Instead of doing this method, what I can do, I can just mention a static block so it will execute

85
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,920
for me.

86
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,550
Static.

87
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,480
I can create a static block in Java.

88
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,190
Similarly, I created this.

89
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:41,520
So now what I'm going to do, I'm going to mention some properties of my SMP protocols properties dot

90
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:52,230
good first is mentioning the host which is basically mail dot SMP dot host.

91
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,090
So what is the host for me?

92
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,980
You can put here a SMTP, which is Gmail code.

93
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,890
Simply be Gmail dot dot com.

94
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,410
So this is my SMP port for gmail.

95
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,850
Then what is the port probs?

96
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,780
Not good.

97
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,180
Not simply because next thing is, I want to mention the port for my SMTP.

98
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,400
Remember, it's always so mentioned indirectly.

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,260
No need to mention a string and I need to mention the authentication part.

100
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,570
So why we need authentication?

101
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,800
We need authentication.

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,630
Always true.

103
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,560
We don't want to stop it.

104
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,090
Simply people.

105
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,500
So let me put like on it is always true.

106
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,300
Are you true?

107
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,320
So I'm performing this true part here.

108
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:57,800
Then we are remaining with Start de Lis or we can say Start, please start this.

109
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,140
So what are these things?

110
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:09,230
So let me mention here, these are the proper PS of SMTP server.

111
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,770
So I'm mentioning all the properties of a SMTP server like mail dot smtp dot host is my gmail.com or

112
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,720
despite seven authentication is true.

113
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,080
So why we need authentication or likewise you have a gmail account and no password we are going to mention

114
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,560
here.

115
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:31,820
So I want to mention that authentication is always true in this case while sending a mail, it's authentication

116
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,480
is always true.

117
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,460
So it will run loop inside this and it will give me the true authentication always.

118
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:51,470
But what I needed before is I need to mention here one thing may not seem to be a simple TV dot start

119
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,320
time to allow service.

120
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,130
Or we can say the.

121
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,090
Anybody else is a very common thing in what you can say.

122
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:10,400
Any running program, if you have taking Jake through this.

123
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:21,080
It's basically transport layer security and we have to enable it always this are well using Gmail here.

124
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,200
So now we are done with this.

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,560
So let me check.

126
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,630
Indexing is now updating and indexing.

127
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,930
So sometimes it may take time.

128
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,560
It's according to your network connection and moment.

129
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,910
So ignore this.

130
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:41,390
Let it be done throughout this project and it will take two or 3 minutes.

131
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,670
Sometimes it takes more time also.

132
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,320
So keep it as it is and go forward with your path.

133
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:56,810
So what we have done is let me tell you again, I'm mentioning the host says this port has this authentication

134
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,390
through and TLS, which is basically transport layer security.

135
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,120
I want to enable and mention as is true part.

136
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,120
So that's it I done here.

137
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:13,690
So now what I want to mention is I want to mention here when send mail message or snail mail thing.

138
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,710
So for that purpose.

139
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,210
We mean same meal.

140
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,890
So I would public static.

141
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,310
Roy, if you know why I'm mentioning word, it's not returning anything.

142
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:39,810
So what is the reasoning if you know the basics or if your method is returning something, relocating

143
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,190
or dislocating some memory, it should be here.

144
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,050
It's not doing anything.

145
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,060
Send mail is my method.

146
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:57,990
I want to mention one parameter is email message, which is my email.

147
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,130
Message.

148
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,150
So there's another parameter I mentioned.

149
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,910
So these are my parameters not.

150
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,230
Anything yet I mentioned.

151
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,230
So I want to know you strike etch or instead of using etch and what I can do.

152
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,090
I need to.

153
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,470
You mention string syndrome.

154
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:25,890
So.

155
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,670
What we are going to do is.

156
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,880
Here is your email.

157
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,380
I mentioning this because I don't want to do this.

158
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,170
I will tell you that about your email and it gmail dot com if you want this.

159
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:47,710
Second parameter is password because for the authentication purpose I'm authenticating this and always

160
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:53,290
to but on which parameters I'm going to take your email address, which is basically username and the

161
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,790
password for the Gmail.

162
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,140
Any SMTP server has specific given specific username and password for you.

163
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:06,820
So similarly, I'm mentioning this similar email.

164
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,720
Plus.

165
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,820
So I will your.

166
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,120
You mean?

167
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:20,630
So this is not my email password and it's not my email also.

168
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,090
I will tell you later what I'm going to put here.

169
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,730
So I'm mentioning it here.

170
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,990
Education better mix.

171
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,470
Okay.

172
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,810
So these are the authentication parameters, which is basically send an email, which is basically username

173
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,610
and password is for the password basis.

174
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,430
So I will tell you what I'm going to do here.

175
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:52,400
Now, let us consider is this a very true thing I'm going to do here like it's a secure thing?

176
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,410
No, not at all.

177
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,600
Because I'm using.

178
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,520
It's public void.

179
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,530
Anyone can check this as a security purpose.

180
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,990
So I will tell you later what I'm going to do here.

181
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,050
I'm going to use string handling and everything I'm going to do here.

182
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,700
But I will tell you later.

183
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,920
For simplicity, I'm keeping like this.

184
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,370
And further part I will change it to more complex thing.

185
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,240
But.

186
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,510
Let me make a connection with server first.

187
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,100
So I need to create a one session

188
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,310
session.

189
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,240
So once this indexing is done, the libraries will automatically edit here and everything will be done.

190
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,710
Session.

191
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
Not yet.

192
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,140
All instances.

193
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:57,370
This default insistence, which is basically very common thing I'm going to do here, is.

194
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,850
On.

195
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,910
Props.

196
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,290
I want to mention here Probst properties and.

197
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,840
Props.

198
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,270
Wait a minute.

199
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:24,680
Let me put your props because it's got props, which is basically properties, then new Coke, new Java

200
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,640
X Lord mail, which is our library.

201
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,900
Mail dot.

202
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,450
Authenticate.

203
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,160
Or Authenticator.

204
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,190
So this is my instances where what is going to do?

205
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,530
It's accessing these properties.

206
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,200
As you can see, these properties will be accessed because this is the static.

207
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,380
These are the properties of a TV server.

208
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,120
It will put this thing, which is basically my.

209
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,450
Or Metal object or becomes a classics object.

210
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,950
And it will ask me through this new Java mix mail authenticated.

211
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:08,080
Now this is the session, so I need to mention two or three things here, which is password protected

212
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,030
thing and everything I'm going to mention.

213
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:16,630
So in the further part, I will tell you how we can create a connection with the server, plus how we

214
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:24,550
are going to handle this thing because now it's currently very unsecure method.

215
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:37,790
And let me tell you why this is unsecure, because this is public and I'm directly putting my password

216
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,490
and email.

217
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:46,190
So if anyone having some injecting in our program or server injection, they can found out this directly.

218
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,770
So instead of this, what you can do is I will tell you later, there are many a lot of options you

219
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,400
can do.

220
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,900
But for this condition, I'm going to use some more other simple options.

221
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,320
If you are testing purpose, you can do this.

222
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,170
And two or three things I'm want to mention here, but I will tell you in letter regarding to the SMTP

223
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,040
port and everything.

224
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,600
Hope you understand.

225
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,500
Thank you.
