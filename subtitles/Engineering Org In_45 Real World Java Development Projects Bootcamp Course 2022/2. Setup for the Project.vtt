00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.110
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:09.450
In this video, I am going to show you how to install and download Visual Studio code on your Windows

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.080
ten operating system.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.930
So let's get started.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.740
So to start with it, just open your favorite web browser and search for Visual Studio code.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.060
And the first link which will appear here will be from quote dot visual dot studio dot com.

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.440
So we are going to click on this name and once this website is open straight away, you will be able

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.070
to see this blue download button for windows.

9
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.430
We are going to just click on this blue button, which is going to download this executable file and

10
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.060
this executable file is around 50 megabytes.

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.980
So I am going to wait for the download to complete.

12
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.770
Once the download is complete, open the executable file and this will appear like this.

13
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.290
So you have to accept the agreement mentioned here.

14
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.550
Click on the next button and here you will receive various checkboxes for the additional tasks required

15
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.510
in the setup.

16
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:33.090
The checkboxes her mention as a create a desktop icon and open with code action and open with code action

17
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.280
in context menu register code.

18
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.380
So keep this checked.

19
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:47.200
And also I would like to check click this checkbox, create a desktop icon as if we have a desktop icon

20
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.700
for Visual Studio code.

21
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.070
It would be very convenient for you to open the app very conveniently.

22
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.170
Then click on the next button.

23
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.400
How do we have to click on the install button and wait for the installation to complete?

24
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.650
So after the successful installation of Visual Studio Code, the Visual Studio Code application will

25
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.090
launch on your desktop and it will look like this.

26
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:30.060
Trust me, it is the best idea for running any of the program you wish to run.

27
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.860
Look at the beautiful layout of Visual Studio code.

28
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.830
We have a file button, edit button, selection button, view button go button run button, terminal

29
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.020
help and so on.

30
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.740
You can click on any of the options and start.

31
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.650
Performing your desirable task with this application.

32
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:09.300
So coming to the fact we are here to create a Java project and I am sure you may be wondering that how

33
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.100
you can run Java programs in your favorite Visual Studio code.

34
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:23.280
So now I am going to show you step by step process to configure Visual Studio code for running Java

35
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.870
programs correctly.

36
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.300
And I am going to also show you how you can run the basic Java program in Visual Studio code on Windows

37
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.350
ten machines.

38
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.700
So without any further delay, let's get started.

39
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.390
Firstly, we have to download the latest version of JDK and to download it we have to visit the official

40
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.380
site of JDK download, which is Oracle.

41
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.840
Now open up your favorite web browser.

42
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.240
I am using Google Chrome here and then open the link appearing on the top of the page.

43
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.950
This link will redirect you to the official site.

44
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.170
Oracle to download latest JDK version.

45
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:23.990
So now you can see we have her download links for JDK for Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

46
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.090
So we are going to download it for Windows.

47
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.380
Now select the 64 bit installer.

48
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.800
Currently it sizes 152 and by clicking on the download link.

49
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.330
The download has started now.

50
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.670
Wait for the download to complete.

51
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.800
So once the download is complete, you can see the executable file in your downloads folder.

52
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.420
So we have to run this executable file to install JDK in our system.

53
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:14.880
So one show that you already have this software installed in your computer, would you like to reinstall

54
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.210
it?

55
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.740
So I am clicking.

56
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.720
No, but you have to wait for the installation to be completed.

57
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:31.530
And once the installation is complete, I will take you to the command prompt which will show you how

58
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.260
JDK is installed and what is the version it will.

59
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.730
Reflect, I think.

60
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.500
Yes.

61
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.090
Type Java minus minus Virgin to get the version of Java.

62
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:54.020
And to check whether the JDK is completely installed in your system or not.

63
00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:01.550
So click enter and yet you can see Java 17.2 .12 years.

64
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.110
JDK is completely installed in your system.

65
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.620
Congratulations.

66
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:14.570
Now there is one more task that we are supposed to do before running a Java program in our favorite

67
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.790
compiler Visual Studio code.

68
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:24.230
So click on the search bar and type environment here.

69
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.750
So there are two options.

70
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.050
We have to select the first one.

71
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.730
Remember, click on the first one only.

72
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.980
Yes.

73
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:40.130
So after clicking on this, we have the environment variable system properties.

74
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.190
We have to click environment variables and then click on this path option.

75
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:55.610
After clicking on this path option, we have to click edit, remember, we have to click edit and then

76
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.960
we have to.

77
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.500
And did the environment variable for Java.

78
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.390
Now I will show you.

79
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:25.200
Here you can see we have this environment variable, but for our JDK version.

80
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.650
So you must be wondering where this part came from.

81
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.990
Let me show this to you.

82
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.750
So go to your desktop settings and then.

83
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.690
File Explorer.

84
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:47.770
Yes.

85
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.320
Go to your C Drive.

86
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.110
And then program files.

87
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.030
Yes.

88
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.810
So search for Java in your program files folder.

89
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.570
The member search for Java.

90
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.230
Yes.

91
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.580
So here it is.

92
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.100
Yes.

93
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.960
So click on the Java 17 and copy the.

94
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.510
But.

95
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.340
When you copy the path from here, you have to paste in your environment.

96
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.160
Variable.

97
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:39.510
Edit button I already have pasted so I will not do anything, but you have to paste it and click on

98
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.740
the okay button.

99
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.490
Remember click on the okay button twice.

100
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.460
Okay.

101
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.020
So your environment variable is set for java.

102
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.540
Now we will close this tab.

103
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.570
After successfully setting the environment variable for JDC.

104
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.450
Now we are here in our Visual Studio code to run a Java program.

105
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.330
So let's get started.

106
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.610
Hey, we have to create a fine new file.

107
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.600
You may create a folder.

108
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.820
To run this.

109
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.150
So I am.

110
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:31.220
So to run a Java program, we have to open any of the folder from our system.

111
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.760
So I am opening a new folder.

112
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.070
And selecting it.

113
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.620
So the folder is open in Visual Studio code.

114
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.070
We have to create a new file, so let me name it.

115
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.370
Hello dot java.

116
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.700
Oh, sorry.

117
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.720
I'm sticking with that, Peter.

118
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.240
Let me rename this.

119
00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.150
Hello.

120
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.470
Dot Java.

121
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.390
Yes.

122
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.310
So we have created a file with extension Java.

123
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:17.480
Remember, it is must to add this dot java at the end of your file name.

124
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:22.640
Now we will run a simple Java program to print helloworld.

125
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.830
So let's start writing our very first program in Java.

126
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.970
We have to create a class.

127
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.330
Name.

128
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.250
Hello.

129
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:50.860
For Blix, that pick would mean.

130
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.170
String.

131
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.420
You meant.

132
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:12.980
So yes, we created a class and under the class we created a main function inside class.

133
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.570
Hello is responsible for running our Hello World Program.

134
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.950
Place inside this.

135
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.620
We have to write this out.

136
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.560
There is a shortcut also.

137
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.110
But I would like to write the.

138
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.850
Completely.

139
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.690
So that you feel it.

140
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.580
Comfortable.

141
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:48.040
Later, I will tell you about the shortcuts in a separate video.

142
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.870
So yes.

143
00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:03.740
System dot dot print is required for printing anything in Java.

144
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.640
Her.

145
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.710
And the inverted comma contains a string helloworld.

146
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:16.700
It is necessary to enclose the string inside the double inverted commas.

147
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.450
So yes, we have written the program successfully.

148
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.780
Now we are here to run this.

149
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.380
Okay.

150
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:32.100
So before running, we missed a semicolon after this break.

151
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.990
Yes.

152
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.340
Now, the code is perfectly fine and we should run it.

153
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.640
So clicking on this run button right here.

154
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.110
Yes.

155
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.000
Perfect.

156
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.680
So we got the output.

157
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.950
Hello world.

158
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.480
Inside the.

159
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.060
Darmanin?

160
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.200
Yes.

161
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.020
So the code is run successfully.

162
00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:04.310
And you successfully run your first Java program, so can congratulate yourself first.

163
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:11.560
Let me tell you a most important feature of this Visual Studio code.

164
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:22.180
If I erase this semicolon, it automatically shows a red indentation error and you can click on this

165
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.910
bulb icon, which appears here.

166
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.800
Which shows that there is a syntax error.

167
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.970
Insert semicolon to complete the log statement.

168
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:43.630
So yes, this is the most important feature of Visual Studio code that it helps us with our mistakes,

169
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.610
it helps us to clarify our errors.

170
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:54.200
So yes, you have to write your code and wait for Visual Studio code to tell you that if your code is

171
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.670
correct or there are some syntax error or compiler error.

172
00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:07.010
So yes, I like Visual Studio code for this specific feature and there are many other features which

173
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:11.420
we will together get to know in this project series.
