1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.770
So we see that the you selected the USA this you think should also change it to the dollar thing.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.180
And if some money change to India you should also change your rupees.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.930
So what should we do?

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.920
We will firstly go to the.

5
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:32.380
You have to take a stringer which shows the currency unit of the Nigeria two naira Brazilian real Indonesia

6
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.510
rupiah Indian rupee.

7
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.580
So what we will think.

8
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.070
Firstly, we have to go to the soothsayer and.

9
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.870
Another class.

10
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.430
Here now.

11
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.870
My currency converter.

12
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.450
Here we can declare.

13
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.110
No.

14
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.010
Okay.

15
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.620
So here we can declare our thing.

16
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.270
Firstly, we have to try.

17
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.030
No.

18
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.490
We have to take a string.

19
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:33.650
All right, so string on the currency unit and duplicate open.

20
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.940
And here we will.

21
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.150
First one is units comma,

22
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.690
and another one should be US dollar.

23
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.390
Okay.

24
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:10.980
Goma and another one should be Nigerian Nido Goma.

25
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.290
And another one will be Brazilian.

26
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.210
Real.

27
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.780
Goma.

28
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.290
Another would be Canadian.

29
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.600
The

30
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.800
next one will be Canyon.

31
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.250
Gagnon I think Schilling Church said it to Gagnon.

32
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.480
Schilling and next one should we don't we have to Indonesia I think.

33
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.380
We have said to Kenya, Indonesia, India and Pakistan.

34
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.080
Next one will be Indonesia.

35
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:17.520
So here, Indonesia, Indonesian rupiah here, and next one will be our Indian rupee simply.

36
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.530
And another one.

37
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.370
The second last one is the Philippines, right?

38
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.610
It should be double P and E and it to pisco.

39
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.090
The last one is the Pakistan, right?

40
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.400
So here's what we will write.

41
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.830
Pakistan, rupee

42
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.130
or semi-colonial.

43
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.930
So you're staring at a name currency unit.

44
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.320
So we'll do the design here.

45
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.900
We have to first declare the variable name for all these components.

46
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.820
So here what we will do is take this comma works and change variable name.

47
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.510
And so to do first country.

48
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.310
First country.

49
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.300
Okay,

50
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:40.480
here, don't take this one and change variable name to second country

51
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.880
and similar to this.

52
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.170
Change rebuilding.

53
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.890
Two, 2 to 1.

54
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.750
Put it to text first.

55
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.450
Country.

56
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.360
So we can remember this.

57
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.260
Text.

58
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.940
Second country.

59
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.790
Okay, so here

60
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:33.250
you change your name post first currency unit.

61
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.780
See here.

62
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:46.030
Change it to the variable name second currency unit.

63
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.630
So all these things done.

64
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.340
And now another one.

65
00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:06.260
Okay, we can take these buttons also, if we change variable name to B to convert and change its variable

66
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.540
name to button reset.

67
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.790
Here now.

68
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.040
What do we have to do?

69
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.260
If the user selected the country, the unique thing should we change?

70
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.490
If the users select her country, the unit should be changed.

71
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:44.830
So what we will do is take the com box and go to the event even and go to the item and I demonstrate

72
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.020
change to it.

73
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.600
Now we have to handle the code here.

74
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.410
So what we will do here?

75
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.690
Firstly, we have to write

76
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.610
we have to change the foreign currency here.

77
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.110
Right.

78
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.560
So we will see first currency unit don't.

79
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.050
Do.

80
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.530
Extend, we have a parcel stream.

81
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:39.180
So firstly we are to take a string string unit equal to we have to get the first item that the user

82
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.110
has selected.

83
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.870
So what should we do?

84
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.090
Okay, let's try.

85
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.100
We have to take the index here.

86
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:57.750
The index should be the position of the first country here, this one and design this option.

87
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:58.800
Right.

88
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.380
It shows under the list options.

89
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.390
So what should we do?

90
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.390
We have to take the position of the.

91
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.500
See here.

92
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.430
These are the countries name.

93
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.310
Here they have.

94
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.080
These are another string.

95
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.950
So here, should they have an index number also?

96
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:30.190
So we have to take that positions number and get it to the user.

97
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.530
So simply.

98
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.390
Close this on.

99
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.760
What should we do?

100
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.840
We have to write a code.

101
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.210
So let me think.

102
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.290
What can we do?

103
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:54.120
We can simply take the position and position and write first.

104
00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:04.150
Three first country to get to this or get selected index.

105
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.810
So here we can get our position.

106
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.140
We have to pass this pollution under the currency unit.

107
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.630
Okay.

108
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:22.420
So set it to the currency unit.

109
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.120
Unbiased position here.

110
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.260
Position.

111
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.320
And we don't need as a string unit.

112
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.790
Here.

113
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.100
We got our position simply.

114
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.110
We run it and check it.

115
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.450
This thing is done or not.

116
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:57.350
So what we are going to do USA which is simply changed to US dollar Nigeria to Nigerian Naira Brazilian

117
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.220
Brazilian Real Canada Canadian dollar Kenyan.

118
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.110
See if user is choosing the Indonesia.

119
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.360
This thing is changing in entropy.

120
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.440
And if we choose the Pakistan or change it to the Pakistan rupee.

121
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.860
So here we have to do this thing also.

122
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.700
Same similar thing so that it could also work.

123
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.440
So what we will do?

124
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:32.690
Firstly go to the designer and simply right click and events and then item thing item state changed.

125
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:42.430
Simply here we have to write the same code here in position.

126
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.010
We have to take the second country here.

127
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.880
Get selected.

128
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.660
So we need that index, right?

129
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:07.440
So it's done and we have to take the second currency unit dot.

130
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.970
Settings.

131
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.070
Currency units.

132
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.880
Simply write the position.

133
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.990
And it's done.

134
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.350
So what can we do here?

135
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:28.960
Position.

136
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.780
Simply run our program and we will check if it takes.

137
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.640
Okay.

138
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.740
So here we choose a U.S. reverse donor here in the Indian rupee.

139
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.640
So everything is going gold.

140
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.660
Now, what we have to do, we have to function this exit button.

141
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.940
If we click on the exit, the program should be terminated.

142
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.200
So what we will do?

143
00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:01.960
We have to write the logic for the exit button, go to the design and right click on the exit button.

144
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.990
Simply double click on it.

145
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.000
And we got our material

146
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:17.430
and we have to write simple one thing system.

147
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.160
System, not exit.

148
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.020
Simply pass the zero here.

149
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.140
Now, simply run our program.

150
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.860
Click on it.

151
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.210
Simply closing our program, terminating the program.

152
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.820
So let's go to design.

153
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.350
Now we have to convert the currency.

154
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:57.560
So we have to convert the currency from currency to one to the other one.

155
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.030
So we have to function this word and also so double click on it.

156
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.740
And we.
