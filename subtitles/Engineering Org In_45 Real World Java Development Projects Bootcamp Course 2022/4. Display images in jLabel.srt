1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,900
Now the next part, we have to display the images here first on the rock paper, on the scissor here.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,760
This will be on the user dependent.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:20,120
So what we will do, we will create our function here for displaying images in the G labels.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,370
So here we will write.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,850
Create a commission to display images in label.

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:39,660
So what we will write we will write public void Newton Display image.

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,020
And here we will give parameters of image path.

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:01:04,460
And another one for the Chili Bowl, my new label, which we need in case you cannot find some more.

9
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,710
Get Capital G.

10
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,600
I am bored.

11
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,760
And so what we will do.

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,980
We already have the images of rock, paper, scissors.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,230
So what?

14
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,260
Here I have my three images.

15
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:39,870
When the new paper, we wrote the answers, we simply just renamed these first.

16
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,700
Only the paper one.

17
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,800
Refactor rename the Rock one and this one will be renamed to two.

18
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,430
Repack here.

19
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,050
We will go to the image part.

20
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:13,230
So here we will write image to spot and we will take it in a string.

21
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,970
Mm.

22
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,250
Raw and simply write images.

23
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,690
Slash.

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,290
Here.

25
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,970
I drop.

26
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,130
Start being Bianchi.

27
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,920
We have.

28
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,010
I'm done.

29
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,640
Similar to that.

30
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,800
We have to.

31
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:55,220
People here we will write images and people not being here seem that post-rock rock references.

32
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,930
In this part we will write.

33
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,980
Images, Souza.

34
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,600
Not being

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,840
here.

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
We have said image.

37
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,770
Image.

38
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,610
But so the next work is to do.

39
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,530
To display images.

40
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,900
In the borders.

41
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,000
And after this, we will write.

42
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,090
Display image.

43
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,920
And we have our legal name right.

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,130
The new Chile will drop.

45
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,870
Clearly when people

46
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,520
display image.

47
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,610
We need the scissors.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,530
And here you will write

49
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,130
scissors.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,850
On this matter, we will create a logic for displaying the images here.

51
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,570
We will write image icon.

52
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,060
Image icon equal to new image icon.

53
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,720
New image icon under the civil right class

54
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,690
identities art resource

55
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,930
here we will give the parameter to image but.

56
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,210
And then we have to import this image and plus.

57
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,830
Okay.

58
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,100
So here we have get the image.

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,460
So we will write the image here.

60
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:18,830
No.

61
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:28,700
We have to resize the images so you can try to resize the images.

62
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,870
So here we will take image.

63
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,600
I am g is equal to the mean I am g.

64
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,440
I go not get image.

65
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,430
And under this we will write.

66
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:47,670
No.

67
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,240
After this, we will write down what we need.

68
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,380
A martyr.

69
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,890
Get killed.

70
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,860
No.

71
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:06,540
We need a model named as get scale instance.

72
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,890
Here we will give the word height and root again.

73
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,010
So what do we have to do?

74
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,940
We have the image.

75
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,780
Okay.

76
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,040
So we have the image front on the label here.

77
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,140
So here we will write this label, not get it.

78
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,980
Same with the label or get tight.

79
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,170
Will not get tight again.

80
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,570
Here.

81
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,900
We will write.

82
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,460
This is image.

83
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,370
In

84
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,540
image to skin.

85
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,520
Smooth.

86
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,850
We have to put this.

87
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,040
Reporter Don't know what we have to do.

88
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,670
We have to set image in the G label.

89
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,320
So after this, resizing the images.

90
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,920
We reset the image in the GDP.

91
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,600
So here we will write label dot.

92
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:51,690
Sit tight under the tree will give barometer of image icon.

93
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,270
Not.

94
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,920
We need a major food.

95
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:10,940
So here we will give the parameter to image here.

96
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,280
So simply run our file and see the output first.

97
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,010
Okay.

98
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,390
So we have the interception.

99
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,900
So here we have said that we what?
