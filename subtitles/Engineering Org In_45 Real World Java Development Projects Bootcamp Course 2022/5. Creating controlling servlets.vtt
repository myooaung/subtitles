00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.070
In previous tutorial, I told you how we created everything.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:12.710
So this is basically audio I already created and this is inside the audio method and it's very simple

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.530
and this audio method.

4
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.670
So it is similar to a librarian deal, but it's required somebody or part already created.

5
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.880
In this tutorial I'm going to create some sublets and all part and in the next region I'm going to deploy

6
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.230
this on the server.

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.340
So let us create how we can create this order.

8
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.370
So let me close this part first.

9
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.720
Okay.

10
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
So now what is required methods we need here?

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.890
Let us see.

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.560
First is ADD because we need to add some book here.

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.720
So let me create one.

14
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.930
Solid, which is basically an inside solid.

15
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.490
Next deployment is.

16
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.860
Well, let me close this part.

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.380
It will create me some default things here.

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.580
Let me close this.

19
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.230
And know what I'm going to do is I'm going to import some exceptions and everything here first.

20
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.360
Due to different libraries I'm using now, I'm importing some methods here, which is basically bin.

21
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.940
And so I'm importing.

22
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.060
Beams Dot store.

23
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.130
I'm importing.

24
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.780
Be a star.

25
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.070
So it will ask me for every method inside that package.

26
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.790
So no need to add it again and again.

27
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.850
Let me create one annotation here, because I mentioned here and wait a minute.

28
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.660
Because.

29
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.980
So let's not.

30
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.550
So we are done with this.

31
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.540
Now, let me add some methods here.

32
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.820
So this is our book in part.

33
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.260
So as you can see, this is done, but we need to create some more methods also, which is basically

34
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.120
ad book form and everything.

35
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.070
So we will create it later.

36
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.290
We are now focusing with this on you.

37
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.830
So this is basically I'm creating print, write statements and everything, and this is all about human.

38
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.460
And this is a dispatcher and I'm including this part.

39
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.000
So what is doing this?

40
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.640
It is assuming call, number, call and all these parameters with that form, name and book.

41
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.490
Then book is saved successfully if this is done and save into the bin part.

42
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:10.420
Or ad or book form or letter L segments, and it will print that and it will be redirect to that part.

43
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.300
So this is book Java.

44
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.100
Let me create one another thing, which is basically add book form.

45
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.160
We haven't created a book form method here.

46
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.650
Why it is required because.

47
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.470
The.

48
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.900
We created admin log in.

49
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.130
Similarly, we need to create this part also.

50
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.600
And book form first.

51
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.600
Then close this one.

52
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.730
I am just to copy wasting the codes basically because I'm concerned.

53
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.950
I don't want to focus on that part.

54
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.980
I'm going to focus on the simpler things here first.

55
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.530
So let me import some libraries.

56
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.340
Default libraries, then let me import some.

57
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.170
Bill, don't start because I'm going to mention that part also here.

58
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.150
Or then let me create one annotation here.

59
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.560
Your first.

60
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.350
And let me add some default things again.

61
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.280
Well, so.

62
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.210
So this is all about this thing and this.

63
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.330
So that's okay.

64
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.760
So now we are done with add ons, but we need to create some HTML files.

65
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.200
In the next tutorial I'm going to tell you how we are going to create the HTML files.

66
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.060
So this is all about this add book form, so do the ad book.

67
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.140
But from what will we do?

68
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.690
It will use that bootstrap and cases form that purpose.

69
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.840
It's back in part, but it should be very helpful while deploying in the servlet.

70
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.320
Similarly, we are remaining with ADD Librarian method.

71
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.260
We created a librarian form, but we haven't created a librarian method because.

72
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.050
So.

73
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.340
Let me create that part.

74
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.710
Also add librarian, mention it to the web dot xml.

75
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.270
If we close this first.

76
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.010
Let me.

77
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.010
Jake this.

78
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.900
Then.

79
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.960
Import.

80
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.490
The Dot star.

81
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.780
Import.

82
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.110
Bing dot star.

83
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.870
So now I'm inputting everything here.

84
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.620
Now.

85
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.340
Let me.

86
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.230
You had some default in here.

87
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.380
Okay.

88
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.270
So now we're done with this ad librarian.

89
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.330
And why am I importing this part?

90
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:12.940
You will understand while deploying this in librarian HTML and everything, we need to invoke that part

91
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.420
and we are using that method with librarians being and being everything in the saved being also.

92
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.730
So this is all about how we can create.

93
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.400
So a librarian form is already created.

94
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.060
Admin login is also created but delete book is haven't created yet.

95
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.710
So let me create one delete book method because we mentioned that we are going to delete edit also issue

96
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:40.870
should also with logout admin also done, but logout librarian is never created, so we need to mention

97
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.380
some delete edit and issue book part first.

98
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.490
So let me create one delete book method here.

99
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.450
So let's solve it again.

100
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.460
This is delete.

101
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.850
Click finish.

102
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.660
Then if you are going to your ID, you will understand everything.

103
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.510
Let me delete this first if you want.

104
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.670
You can keep that part.

105
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.150
But.

106
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.470
I already mentioned that.

107
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.470
You can create some code already and you can use that again and again.

108
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:22.480
Let me import the method because for this we are creating that delete book part and let us create that

109
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.350
delete part.

110
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.040
Again.

111
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.940
This is basically.

112
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.930
So let's only.

113
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.060
This is no longer required because it's not overriding an exception.

114
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.560
So you can do that.

115
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.460
And let me check where is the view book?

116
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.110
So view book we haven't mentioned yet.

117
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.570
So we need to create a view book method also here.

118
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.620
But before this or.

119
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.380
We need to create some new book also.

120
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.650
So let me mention all the things here.

121
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.450
So I'm mentioning this, Soledad, because it's inside the Soledad.

122
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.950
If you check this ad librarian, you have to check all the things here.

123
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.450
The job also is extremely lonely, so no need to mention this.

124
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.630
Always give the fully specified names.

125
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:18.850
You.

126
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.990
Melinda Beebe I'm going to create some of book methods also.

127
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.270
So this is done, but delete librarian method is remaining over.

128
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:38.390
So in the next part, I'm creating only this and I'm going to explain this delete and everything.

129
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.090
So.

130
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.570
Let us create one.

131
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.400
Delete this part also.

132
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.480
So why am not mentioning this again and again?

133
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.070
Because it's very simple logic.

134
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.870
No, no, I'm telling you.

135
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.440
What is this?

136
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.900
Bookies do it, do it and everything.

137
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:07.040
It will get request or parameter using call number basically from the delete part and it will give you

138
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.320
the create servlet and it will display on the blue book part.

139
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.320
So this is all about these things.

140
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.380
So let me also.

141
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.330
So I'm what I'm doing is just I created all the parts, but I need to mention the methods inside the

142
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.160
solids because it's a controlling part.

143
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.150
So.

144
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:27.990
Let me.

145
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:34.330
Except this also because inside the deal only I mentioned all these things.

146
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.630
So I'm using the method again and again.

147
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.940
In view librarian method is also done, but.

148
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.570
So again, this will be delete librarian method using similar methods.

149
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800
So in the folder things I'm going to create edit librarian.

150
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:15.810
Edit Librarian form issue issue librarian from logout librarian librarian log in then some written book

151
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.370
written book form view book form.

152
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.820
So I will explain it in the next video.

153
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.490
I will directly use that templates and everything in this video and I will explain this part in the

154
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.270
next video.

155
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.460
So you understand this part.

156
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:36.900
What I did is I just created the A0 and bean method, which is purely based on that part or logic.

157
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:42.780
But in the servlet method I'm creating some controlling part because we mentioned everything, but I'm

158
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:49.490
fetching all the data in the solids only and I am mentioning that in the and I'm using logic of the

159
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.840
EU and being packages insert servlet.

160
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.020
So this is it for this tutorial.

161
00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.960
In the next thing I'm going to mention you and I'm going to tell you how I used everything here and

162
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.930
I, I will create some web pages also here.

163
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.390
So this is it for this tutorial.
