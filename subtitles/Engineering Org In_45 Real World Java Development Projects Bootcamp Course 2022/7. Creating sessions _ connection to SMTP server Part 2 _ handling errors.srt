1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:09,800
So in previous careers I told you we created different solids.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,170
And remember in this male client, which is my solid four solid.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:26,760
So this email client, instead of accessing to the web XML which is basically controlling file what

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,630
I created, I added the annotation for creating the mappings.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,360
So this is the mapping thing here, I added.

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:41,340
So if you don't know what is the mapping thing, it is just WebLogic smelting and just adding this here.

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,970
So.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,230
This will at the back end for index launches.

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,220
This is my index GSP.

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,460
It was Monday.

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,850
So this then this then email message I created in the password text.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm going to add my password later.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,760
And in this, what we created already created is just.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,920
Our What we can say email utility thing.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,840
So now what I'm going to do, I'm going to add here my email and I'm going to add my password off my

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,460
email in this letter.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,690
So let me do one thing.

18
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,070
I added CC address, BCC address and everything here.

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:39,610
So what is the remaining thing is I just added this email address to length, but it's we need to create

20
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:46,870
one address to field because I created CC, BCC everything, so I need to create one for loop here.

21
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,620
So creating the for loop is very easy.

22
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,050
If you know this, what I'm going to do is very common thing.

23
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,320
I'm just going to travel to this list.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,850
Using I need int is equal to zero initialize with variable.

25
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,200
I use less than email ids.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,570
You have that email like this field ids dot length.

27
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,610
Land and what it is I lost.

28
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,630
So that's it I'm going to do.

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,600
And what I'm going to add here is.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,660
When this is done addressed to field.

31
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,310
I needed addressed to Field.

32
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,660
Which.

33
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,670
I meant.

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,020
With water.

35
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,280
It is.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,470
I need to add this new which is going to create one new object in here.

37
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,310
What it is.

38
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,620
Okay.

39
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,620
New and internet address.

40
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,420
Which internet address?

41
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,600
And an email in.

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,110
Email.

43
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,820
Ideas with.

44
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,280
Led by.

45
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:20,580
So do you create me the what you can say travels through that and it will assign this address to which

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,140
I had filled again and again so I don't require it to travel one by one.

47
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,420
It will automatically add both things.

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,930
Similarly, I need to create address field.

49
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,980
So let me do one thing here.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,670
How I added this, I need to add this address and I created no similar thing I need to perform here,

51
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:53,190
which is basically the these things or one thing you can do, I'm adding in triggers because I need

52
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,290
to handle the exceptions.

53
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,970
But if you don't want to use triggers, you can really use your throws here.

54
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,180
So you can check out that part also.

55
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:09,390
But I'm using catch here I catch block for error an exception handling similar I'm going to perform

56
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,690
for in I is equal to zero.

57
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,520
I is less than email.

58
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,810
It is length basically.

59
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,410
Because it will travel through this again.

60
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,620
And I need to check that email.

61
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,510
It is now it's in the ladies CC.

62
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,660
Because CC field not the common field.

63
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,340
Then address cc.

64
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,350
I need to perform.

65
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,160
Let me copy the cc.

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,100
CC I feel is equal to new internet address.

67
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,600
I need to engineer again.

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,380
Similar thing to perform internet address.

69
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,430
Then this field again which is basically.

70
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,540
Or email IDs.

71
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,130
CC So this is.

72
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,550
You got?

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,160
No, no, no, no.

74
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,560
Not because I need to travel to this.

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,950
So let me mention here.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,360
Do.

77
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,710
Actresses.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,430
CC Pegasus is going to check.

79
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,970
Now, what is the main thing here I'm going to add this week so.

80
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,530
It may do one thing.

81
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:09,520
Let me directly copy which I already created a code because I don't want to focus it more because it's

82
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
commenting again and again.

83
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,620
I'm going to traverse after this.

84
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,080
What I needed is the more important thing is.

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,790
If address failed, which is addressed to length, basically addressed to length.

86
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,770
Is greater than zero, which is basically perfect condition.

87
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,820
I need to mention it.

88
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,690
Message dot set distribution open.

89
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,900
So I'm going to add the receiver in.

90
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,780
Yeah.

91
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,170
Dude, basically message my message not.

92
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,600
They are the type.

93
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,100
CC.

94
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,980
It will add type a CC.

95
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,150
Because my mail doesn't know that it's C C form or BC form.

96
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,350
So that's it.

97
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,180
I need to mention.

98
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,720
Known similar for weeks because.

99
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,410
Oh.

100
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,920
Okay.

101
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,700
Address to or.

102
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,490
Wait a minute.

103
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,130
This is for two adults, not be.

104
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:37,130
So do I need to mention now I have to create for CC because I created for CC first.

105
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,970
Now I need to mention for a CC length greater than zero.

106
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,270
I need to see your message.

107
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,400
Dorset again.

108
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,260
Similar things I need to mention.

109
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,500
Message and messages is nothing but that email feed here.

110
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,030
Or type c.

111
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,720
C.

112
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,770
And this is not address this is an should be this.

113
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,110
Oh.

114
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,920
And similarly for VC.

115
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,620
So let me just do one thing.

116
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,020
Let me copy this part because I need to change some variables on you.

117
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,380
Not everything here.

118
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,490
We?

119
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,020
She

120
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,320
is.

121
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,040
So.

122
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,670
Wait a minute.

123
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,460
Something is different here.

124
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,570
So whites asking me for.

125
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:18,830
Okay.

126
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,360
Let me check it again.

127
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,570
Whether there's error or something, there should not be any error.

128
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,890
Now it's done because I haven't decided.

129
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,590
So now we are done.

130
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,040
So I need to mention content with everything.

131
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:54,830
So this is my content type set subject to subject, subject and content type and.

132
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,580
Let it take that.

133
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,320
For using switch case, whether it's text or HTML or plain text.

134
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,040
So if it's email message, as you know, that is HTML and everything symbols, it will go with the HTML

135
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,700
tab tag.

136
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,790
If not, it will check for that purpose.

137
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,630
So.

138
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,490
This is my last function, which is going to transport my.

139
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:33,160
Function same meal, which is very, very easy function.

140
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:45,940
Transport Java X mean don't send direct message so it will directly handle my message.

141
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,430
So that's it.

142
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
Let me do one thing here.

143
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,930
Okay.

144
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,430
So.

145
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,650
Let me optimize my imports.

146
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,570
So now you can check here.

147
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,440
We are done with this part.

148
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,780
And now what I'm going to do, I'm going to add my password and email here.

149
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,010
So.

150
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,030
Are you doing this?

151
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,480
So here I'm going to get my email.

152
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,020
So let me do one thing.

153
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,690
Let me add my password.

154
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,300
Then let me add my emails.

155
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,020
So these are my received email.

156
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:43,020
I'm not sharing my ID thing because of safety, because I don't want to expose my ID and everything.

157
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:57,270
And if you want to check or give the full password field, I recommend you don't give just that password

158
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,220
or take in this.

159
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,550
Just try to give fully the location of your password.

160
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,510
So there may be some times there or not every time.

161
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,400
Sometimes there may be error by locating such files.

162
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:23,520
So my suggestion is give a fully fledged name to that password field.

163
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,140
Just copy that and you can go to go to paste that field.

164
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,620
So my feelings and everything is at it.

165
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,720
And this is the thing where I'm going to receive my email, another email.

166
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,770
So.

167
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:52,890
Now before proceeding with any project, let me tell you one thing here.

168
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:59,340
Always remember this bomb smell and everything we already created.

169
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:09,780
But try to turn on your or no one sitting in Gmail, which is basically very common setting allow or

170
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,980
least secure apps.

171
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,520
So our app security is very also allow it.

172
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,680
If you want to do this full fledged, you need to upload these files on Google Cloud.

173
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,460
Then you need to find the SHA256 key, you need to register everything.

174
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,780
So that's a complicated thing.

175
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:32,700
Instead of this, you can allow that temporary mail for that purpose, like allow the low secure apps

176
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,960
for your email.

177
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,850
So it is very helpful.

178
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,480
Now what I'm going to do is I need to edit configuration here.

179
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,610
I'm going to edit one condition.

180
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,680
If you don't want to do this, it's not at all required always.

181
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,170
But let me check my configuration.

182
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,730
Okay.

183
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,170
This is the configuration I hit click and hit run.

184
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:04,050
So it takes time to run sometimes because first time it's building where I open the ID first, this

185
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,850
is the first time it's going to open.

186
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,710
So this is the stressing part.

187
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,840
In the next tutorial I'm going to tell you how we can perform the receiver part.

188
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,500
So now you can check it's currently running and building everything, so it will take time to do this.

189
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,530
Once this is done, you can check here for the service purpose.

190
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,870
So currently my service is not started because my project is building.

191
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,300
So.

192
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,410
Forcing pool project to rebuild, basically.

193
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:43,640
So it takes time because we have too many modules surveyed for doing this all the stops.

194
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,310
So.

195
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,690
It will take time sometimes.

196
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:58,840
Don't try to interrupt this process because this is not very heavy application, but we added some normal

197
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
things also.

198
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,660
Then after those calls also, there may be errors as well.

199
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,890
I think now you can build a successful.

200
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:12,980
And you can check.

201
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,820
Services not started it, but it will start.

202
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,760
So it started the building output.

203
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,390
But.

204
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Billy's completed first time, but now it's no need to run the service also.

205
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,270
So it may take time.

206
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,490
So wait for me to 3 seconds.

207
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,750
No, my.

208
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,890
You can check.

209
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:48,260
My tomcat is now running, so it will take time to run everything.

210
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,520
And it will give me the direct output of my team.

211
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,180
So wait for running part.

212
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,760
It will take time to run everything.

213
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,620
So currently it's running.

214
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,640
And.

215
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,900
It will take time for 3 seconds.

216
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,670
So as you can see, it's now running.

217
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:40,350
So you can see the server is connected, but artifact is now deploying on my team.

218
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,790
So our artifact is var and this is exploding.

219
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,790
So it will take time.

220
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,500
Two, 3 seconds to run everything.

221
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,800
So.

222
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,320
It's configuring everything.

223
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,800
As a hourglass preserver.

224
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,230
It doesn't have such power to do so.

225
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,110
Now you can check my email application is not working.

226
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:10,080
I need to put this mail message as test and email bodies just use.

227
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,310
Is X.

228
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:21,720
I mean, from Java application.

229
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:35,140
So once I click send or HTTP post is not supported by a URL because the thing is it's method not allowed

230
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,560
sometimes.

231
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:42,610
So in the further thing what I'm going to do, I'm going to review this and why this is showing the

232
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:42,940
error.

233
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,650
I will tell you this is not method alone, so we will rectify this error in lecture.

234
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,970
Thank you for this.

235
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,440
And in the further part, I'm going to explain everything and how I perform this.

236
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,040
I will tell you.

237
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,270
Hope you understand.

238
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,900
Thank you.
