1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:09,500
So in this video we will be talking about our next three classes, which are for the cashier purpose,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:16,640
and these classes will be used by the admin to add any cashier, search for any cashier or delete any

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,030
cashier.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,960
So these will be the three classes, the first class we will be having.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,150
Look on this is add cashier class.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,210
So this class is defined inside the package store.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,740
Very important the necessary packages like import font but j button j label menu menu item g panel,

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,010
scroll panel j text j text area and password feed.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,290
These all are the packages inside the Java export string.

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,220
Then we have defined imported color action lesson and action event.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,930
These are the packages inside a, w, t and JWT event respectively.

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,240
Then we have defined our class.

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,200
And Cashier, which is extending panel inside which we have a text field type of variable user field

14
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,810
or g button type of variable button add cashier.

15
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,440
Then there is a password field type of variable password field and j label named as error and setting

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,650
the string e r as enter username and password.

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,650
And there is a two types of string user and pos.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,610
Then we have defined the non parameterized constructor for the.

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,130
Plus the set, the layout of the constructor as null.

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,910
After that, we have Santa bound for the frame, which is located as hundred and 100 and excise will

21
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,250
be 840 cross 619.

22
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,150
Then we have defined the jailable label ad cashier named as ad cashier and we have set the bound for

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,360
it.

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:49,050
Whose location will be 328, comma 45 and size will be 182 cross 21 Then we have set the font for that

25
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,560
label.

26
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,850
Font will be Tahoma font plain and its size will be 17.

27
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,870
Then we have added the label add cashier to our frame.

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:04,710
Similarly, we have added another label named as username font for its font family Tahoma font type

29
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,240
plain and font size 14 setting the bound for it bound is to 46 comma 104 sizes 124 cross 21 adding that

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,500
label to our frame after that inside the label password.

31
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,770
The app which is labelled as password said the font for it.

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,010
Similar font for this label also and bound for it.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,870
The bound is location 246 comma one 3600 sizes 124 comma 21 adding that label to frame.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,120
Similarly, we have a label sorry text field as user text field setting the bound for it, which is

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,220
430 611106 and it sizes 147 comma 20 adding that user field to our frame.

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,440
After that there is a button add cashier which is labeled as cashier, so this will handle an event.

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,610
So we have defined actions and action performed method inside action performed method.

38
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,610
We have initialize the user string to user field or get text frame so the train method will trim the

39
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,610
string from the any spaces.

40
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,310
Either is starting middle or last the password field.

41
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,900
Similarly we have did with the password feed converted into the to to stream and to to lowercase as

42
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,320
well.

43
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,030
After that, if the username and password is null, we will set the error message that you should enable

44
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,040
either invalid username password or send the username password.

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,460
Then if that those are not null, then we will be calling add cashier method of the database class which

46
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,620
we have discussed earlier and.

47
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,700
And then we will set the user fee, set text as null and password fields that text as null.

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,630
After that we have ADD cashier setting the bound for that button for 3621, 94 and its location is 147

49
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,420
plus 33, adding that button to the frame.

50
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:53,840
Similarly, we have a password field where we will be entering our password and after that there is

51
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,770
an error label which will store or show the error whenever any error or occurs.

52
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,670
So this is the ADD case share method and now we will be looking at the search cashier method.

53
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,710
So this class.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,700
Define inside the package store.

55
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:16,720
We have imported the necessary package like Java eight dot font swing dot button swing dot label g panel,

56
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,680
scroll pane.

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,090
Text area, text field.

58
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,670
Action is not an action event.

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,320
Now we have defined our class, which is extending the G Flame G panel and there is a text field, ID

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,980
field and a button, but an update product and the label has error.

61
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,040
ID comma error is equals to enter product productivity.

62
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,600
Then we have defined the non parameter constructor of this class.

63
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,560
Search cashier center layout of the frame as null.

64
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,980
Then we set the bound for that frame 100 108 sizes.

65
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:54,750
Eight 4619 Then we will be searching for the label search cashier and that set the bound of 3 to 19

66
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,190
cross three, 1984 and 182 plus 21 ages sites.

67
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:06,780
Then we have defined the font, family type and size for that, adding that label to the frame.

68
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,690
After that, we have defined the label label user name as username.

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,350
Similarly, we have defined the font family type and size for that label set the bound for that label

70
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,340
location has 253 and 56 and size as 124 cross 21.

71
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,670
After that, we have edited and added that label to our frame.

72
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,200
Similarly, we have ID field, which is a text field setting the bound for the text field.

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,990
449 comma 158 is its location and its size will be 136 cross 20 Then we have added that field to our

74
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,660
frame.

75
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,350
After that there is a button product update product.

76
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:53,560
So this will be new button search label as search button and then we will be adding action listener

77
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,030
to that button and we have defined action performed method for that button.

78
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,700
So if the ID field of get text is equal to null, so if the ID field is null, then we will show the

79
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,080
error message that you should enter valid ID after that.

80
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:17,260
If the text field is not null, then we will show the ID is equal set by IDs, goes to the fields text

81
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,800
entry.

82
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:26,270
So we'll be setting the ID a string to the provided ID from the text field and call the DB search cashier

83
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:34,120
method, which will be showing and displaying the details of that cashier for that particular ID.

84
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,980
After that, we have set the button set the button search.

85
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,920
It's bound location will be for 49 to 19 and its size is 136 plus 23.

86
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,050
Added that button to our frame.

87
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,720
After that we have defined the error label with the null value foreground color as red and setting it

88
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:01,810
boundary 49, comma to 77 and sizes 217, cross 14 and added that label also to our frame.

89
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,520
So this is about the search cashier or Java file.

90
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,420
Now we will be having a look at our delete file, which will help us to delete any details of the cashier.

91
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,690
So this is also defined inside the package store.

92
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:26,170
And we have defined or imported packages like a dot font saying dot j button label menu, menu item

93
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,280
j panel scroll pane text area text field j password field color action lesson an action event.

94
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,480
These are the packages we have imported.

95
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,080
After that, we have defined our class, which is extending the J panel.

96
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,090
Text filled and there is a G text field named as user field.

97
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,050
G button as button delete catcher.

98
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,170
Then is the password field and another label as L and a string.

99
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,280
There are three string user paths and it goes to enter username and password.

100
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,570
Then we have defined the non parameter constructor for this delete catcher class.

101
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,340
Also setting the layout as null.

102
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:07,390
Then we have set the bound for the frame like location and Red Cross and read from 108 sizes eight 4619

103
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:15,340
then we have defined the label delete catcher setting the bound for it whose location is 328 comma 45

104
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,290
and sizes 182 class 21.

105
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,320
After that we have defined the font.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,950
Family phone type and font size.

107
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,510
Then we have a defined edit label label delete catcher tool frame.

108
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:35,260
Similarly for the user name we have and define the label set the font for that label with the help of

109
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,530
dot set font, its font type font family and font size.

110
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:46,270
Then we have set the boundary to 46 comma 104 and sizes 124 cross 21 added that label to our frame.

111
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:52,720
Then we have defined the password field password label as well and setting the font for it font, family

112
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,380
font type and font size.

113
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,690
Then there is a label password for which we have set the bound.

114
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,080
Which location is 246 comma 136 and sizes one 2421 And then there is we have added that label to our

115
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:05,960
frame.

116
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,210
After that, there is a user field which is a text field setting bound for it, which is location is

117
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:15,480
440 9106 and its size is 136 cross 20.

118
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,640
Then we have added that user field as well to our frame.

119
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:28,770
After that there is a button delete here, so that is labeled as the cashier and then we have a defined

120
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,500
action list and define the action.

121
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:39,660
Perform the method method for this button, delete cashier and which will be taking our argument as

122
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,170
action event of lib named as e inside which we have initialized our user ID string with the user filtered

123
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,510
text and trimming that text.

124
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,060
And then we have initialized our password field as well by converting it to lower case and also training

125
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,900
that password.

126
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,510
Now if the user and password field is equals either of them as equals to null, then we will show the

127
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,550
error message that enter username or password.

128
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,510
If there is none of these fields will be null, then we will be calling our debit or delete cashier

129
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:15,120
method by passing the username and password to that argument for that particular method that is delete

130
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,850
cashier so debit or delete cashier will call.

131
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:26,690
The Delete catcher method from our baby class and delete the record for that particular username and

132
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,290
password.

133
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,090
After that, the button delete share.

134
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:35,420
We have set the bound for that button whose location is 449 comma 194 and sizes 136 cross 23.

135
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,850
After that we have added that button to our frame.

136
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,410
Then we have defined the password field and set the bound for the field.

137
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:49,400
Whose location is 449 comma 138 and its sizes 136 cross 19 adding that password field to our.

138
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,680
Frame and the error label which will be used if.

139
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,970
We did not enter any values in ID or a username or password field.

140
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,870
So these are the three classes which we have discussed or used for the cashier that are we can either

141
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:12,600
add cashier or we can search for the cashier and we can also delete the cashier.

142
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,630
So that's all in this.
