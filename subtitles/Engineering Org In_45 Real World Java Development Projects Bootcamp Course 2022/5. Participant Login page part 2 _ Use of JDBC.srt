1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,170
In previous session I told you basics of Java servlet.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,010
Then we created participant login page with HTML.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,400
Then we created a participant signup and participant login.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,120
So participants sign up.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,050
What is the participant signup requirements?

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,710
We need to take user input from participant signup page.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,310
Name their username, their password and confirm password field.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:34,770
So in previous session for the admin page and for the security purpose, what I created, what I used,

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,950
I just wrote a Java program using that.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,950
Inside the Java program, I mentioned the list of admins and their password system default passwords.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,900
I'm going to create so admin will require the system default username and system default password.

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,720
So I'm not giving any changes for admin.

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,080
Admin restrictions are very I'm giving the restrictions to admin to use or stick to that username and

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,860
passwords.

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,540
But for the participants, log in.

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,090
What I'm going to do, I'm going to take username from them, only I'm going to get password and confirm

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,080
password from there.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,310
Only I'm not going to give some default participants or something.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,910
In everyday life, you can see the you can see the different websites also that's using this.

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,230
And here I'm going to use this part.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,710
So for the participants, log in or signup page.

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,900
Sorry, I'm going to create one java.

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,010
Let's stop.

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,430
So what you can do is just go to source package here, right click new and create Java servlet here.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,820
But always remember in the further process, you have to mention that in the web dot XML part, it will

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,680
ask you to you want to edit that part into the web, xml or not, but always remember you have to add

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,970
it to the web XML.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
As you can see in some part.

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,180
Let me open the Web XML file here.

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,490
So this is WebEx.

31
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,640
So you can see this is Soviet post.

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,890
Soviet validated, then stored up.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,320
I created too many.

34
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:15,570
So.

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,610
So these are mappings, the bullet mappings and everything.

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:26,610
If you are not giving any solid mapping the HTML file and the our Java file or Java Soviet file, it

37
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,170
will not attach to anyone.

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,950
So we will use the attaching bolt.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,230
We can say for the HTML and Java.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,650
So always remember take that part inside while creating the solid.

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,540
So let us see how we can store.

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,000
So as I told you in the folder, you have to ask for this request.

43
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,280
Now we are going to store this into the database.

44
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,110
So we need one more thing.

45
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,870
Import Java dot school.

46
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:59,720
So these are the default library in Java skill store you are going to use dot star for the all libraries

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,250
include all libraries inside this because I don't want to specify each and every library.

48
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,760
So just put don't start after any library.

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,460
You will get all libraries here.

50
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:17,400
So after creating public class stock exchange to HTTP servlet because we are going to create a HTTP

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,000
servlet here, I'm going to use again to post return.

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,030
Then this is I'm going to create a HTTP servlet request variable name as a request HTTP servlet response

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,520
variable as a response which throws our exception and servlet exception.

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,460
I told you earlier while creating admin part, admin validation part.

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,470
So this is the response set content type text or email.

56
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,930
Why we are using this line.

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,840
So in further, I'm going to put some HTML tags inside Java program.

58
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,320
But Java doesn't know that is HTML or text.

59
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:05,460
If I'm not mentioning this, it will directly forward to the HTML page and estimates shows that part

60
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,160
with tag only inside the body.

61
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,100
So it should be an inch html part.

62
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,220
So I'm specifying this with tag.

63
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,370
So create print statement out dot response out is equal to response or get writer.

64
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,310
These are some default statements you are going to use here.

65
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,650
So what I'm going to fetch is your.

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,410
Fetching.

67
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,020
Data from.

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,330
The up.

69
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,150
Dot.

70
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,310
I'm pitching.

71
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,960
Strong.

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,210
User.

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,810
So I'm facing this data.

74
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,260
I told you in earlier part.

75
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,970
So I created this.

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,170
So I'm going to face this data from user only.

77
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,960
And from.

78
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,800
HTML part, so always remember your this name.

79
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,610
P name.

80
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,320
P username password.

81
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,200
Remember these names and just do that.

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,630
Names only don't change name or anything.

83
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,600
Otherwise you can just copy paste here that part.

84
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:21,210
So these are created you can directly use these names also here, but I'm going to assign these to another

85
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,660
string.

86
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,850
So to remember a12834 is very quite equal.

87
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:33,990
Or we can say just for my comfort, comfort zone, I'm going to use this.

88
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,370
So I'm going to assign.

89
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:36,910
Do.

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,180
Another things just.

91
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,020
I'm putting this.

92
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,740
I'm going to Los Angeles to another things.

93
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,670
So, no, this is not a very required part.

94
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,190
You can exceed that part and you can use only these parts only.

95
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,500
But these are very specified name.

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:01,330
I'm going to use a one for username, a two for password field, a three for confirm password.

97
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,630
Why am I going to I'm not storing password field in database.

98
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,570
I'm going to store only password field.

99
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:14,380
But for the confirmation, I'm going to use this name to if I'm going to store a full name also there.

100
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,700
So if a two means our password is equal to the confirmed password.

101
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,820
As you know, our password and confirm password should be seen.

102
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,320
What I'm going to do is try.

103
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,840
So if I'm not using try, it will throw the escalator inside this.

104
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,860
So for you exception handling, I'm going to use your try.

105
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,840
Asked for a name to invoke Oracle Driver.

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,390
As I told you, you have to invoke this Oracle Java file, oracle gbk 14 jar file.

107
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,490
It will load using this part.

108
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,390
Always remember or string connection model with GBC Oracle team.

109
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,710
I'm going to create some default files and I will share that files also so you can use directly.

110
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,910
These are the system default.

111
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,890
You can change to your user.

112
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:11,870
If you create another user inside a skill, you can specify them and the password here so you can directly

113
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,610
view the this you are l to this part then password and system and everything here.

114
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,950
But I'm assigning to do some strings.

115
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:28,740
And I'm going to tell this part so I will just like username of database, I'm going to use system default

116
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,550
database here.

117
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,360
Not I'm going to create password or system.

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,460
So that's my password and everything.

119
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:42,180
If you don't want to reveal your password or something, you can create text file and you can take that

120
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,300
from the text file without displaying the information.

121
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,920
But this is very complicated part inside this already.

122
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,110
This is a skill set are very complicated.

123
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,270
So I don't want to focus on that part.

124
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,690
Very complex part.

125
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,740
So now we need to create connection.

126
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,180
So I will put here.

127
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,650
Weird connection.

128
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,560
So always remember while creating connection what you are going to do.

129
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,050
Connection, which is basically a squirrel part.

130
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,430
A squirrel connection is equal to con connection and giving the.

131
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,090
Very well.

132
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,830
Just the new manager.

133
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,870
Also the driver manager.

134
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,160
Oracle Driver Manager.

135
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,870
Dot Gate Connection.

136
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,990
With which connection URL specify user is this and password disease.

137
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,660
So in school statements, you know, these are some SQL statements.

138
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,810
I'm going to tell you as I told you.

139
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,190
I'm going to disconnect this and I'm going to clear screen this first.

140
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,550
What?

141
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,760
In school we are speech.

142
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,500
Why connect?

143
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,010
So what is connect inside IDs?

144
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,730
Connect IDs basically this connection with connection neural as our java doesn't know what is the connection?

145
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,610
So this is the connection you are in with the local machine.

146
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,310
Now we are going to specify a user system.

147
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,870
Similarly, I told you and with the password.

148
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,930
So this is all about the connection skill statements.

149
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,450
So while doing in ID what we are going to use, we are going to use this statement.

150
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,630
No.

151
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,240
What is this quick statement?

152
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,900
So we need to create one statement, otherwise it will not execute any statements or something.

153
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:36,910
We know our statements are different than Java, so we need to create one statements here.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,150
So use this connection to create statements.

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,850
Then I will specify this as a school statement.

156
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,310
Mention this.

157
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,500
Insert string.

158
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,520
Insert into PPI.

159
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,540
Login details.

160
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,260
Values.

161
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,620
Are these.

162
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,280
These.

163
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,870
So this is all about the values.

164
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:05,590
But, you know, the fiscal statement command or if you don't know how we can insert in plug in details.

165
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,260
Plug in details is basically creating the database.

166
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,810
First, I will tell you how you can create the database.

167
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,890
The national database is very simple.

168
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,950
Just put create.

169
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,080
Cable.

170
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,770
What we are going to use is here.

171
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,180
Log in details.

172
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,190
These are values.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,420
Just copy this part.

174
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,590
You can see control.

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,290
See this part?

176
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,860
Copy.

177
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,240
Just right click here.

178
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,800
You can see this plug in details here.

179
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,780
Now the login details in CMD.

180
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,770
Then this right here, follow all the things.

181
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,620
So first I'm going to specify the username.

182
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,230
Worker for the string here mentioned the length of string.

183
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,820
I'm going to put you at 100.

184
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,600
Password, but I will put like this password again.

185
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:58,260
We are required to basically for the string these and then name we carried to which 500.

186
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,330
I'm going to specify that it exit with semicolon.

187
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,780
Now you can see our table is created similarly.

188
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,580
You can create another table for this.

189
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,530
Belonging duties in your skill commanding.

190
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,520
For values.

191
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,280
What I'm going to enter a1 A1 field for username, A2 field for password.

192
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,060
I told you password this password if for field for the name.

193
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,560
So always remember for candidate that even to a to otherwise it will not execute.

194
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:34,820
It will throw the exception its exception use this single command then double inverted comma plus plus

195
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
sign and insert this follow these rules.

196
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:43,730
These are some really important things in this results that are as is equal to statement executed to

197
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:50,330
us then request dispatcher this for executing query like just to create it but you are not pressing

198
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,210
the enter similarly like that you have to result put this result statement then request.

199
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,920
DISPATCHER If this is correct, go to P log in details.

200
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,810
I do that forward.

201
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,560
I told you.

202
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,610
Close this connection, this very important exception.

203
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,560
It is not corrected like our iTunes password and confirm password fields are not equal.

204
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,520
What it will print?

205
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,390
It will print.

206
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,670
Please enter password and confirm password.

207
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,210
Same.

208
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,210
And it will remain on that page only.

209
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,490
So this is all about this.

210
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,980
This is a very important part.

211
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,570
I will put command here also.

212
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,950
Connection.

213
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,950
And storing.

214
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,600
In two.

215
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,840
Database.

216
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,360
So that is about the database.

217
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,320
This is very simple.

218
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,290
I'm going to store only in further videos or tutorials.

219
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,570
I'm going to tell you how you can validate participants with log in information and everything.

220
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,670
But let us deploy these first.

221
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,250
So as I told you, for deployment, Click Run or Click Clean and build here.

222
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,840
So let me open the output part here.

223
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,150
If your output window is not showing, just go to window here and you can see output part here or you

224
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,830
can press control plus for year.

225
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,790
Also, if you are output output part or anything is not showing here.

226
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,350
So as you can see, Glass Server is now currently running.

227
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:25,610
So it will take time to run everything and it will just show glass which is now running in Chrome or

228
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,570
your default browser.

229
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,730
It will directly load that page.

230
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,540
So as I told you, we created a connection and everything.

231
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,280
You're.

232
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,400
You can see hibernate server is starting Java security manager then these are some signatures are created

233
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,410
inside this so.

234
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:46,930
These are.

235
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,520
So now our

236
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,690
server is deployed.

237
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,080
On this.

238
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,550
As you can see, our port is now change 2002 last fiscal.

239
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,040
So as I told you, we have seen through the glass, fish and everything.

240
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,360
First I've been logging.

241
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,480
Now I'm going to specify only the participant.

242
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,580
Log in as I click to participants, log in.

243
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,280
You can see participant sign up and participant logging page.

244
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,440
I'm going to use participant sign in page here.

245
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,620
I'm going to James Name username j101 password.

246
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,950
I'm going to specify 1 to 3 if I'm not specifying password one, two, three, four and confirm password

247
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,660
field as four five, six, seven.

248
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,250
It will show, as you can see.

249
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,010
Please enter password and confirm password.

250
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,490
Same.

251
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,060
So now I'm going to enter everything.

252
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,090
You can use CAPTCHA or some statements and different things here.

253
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,650
Also, you can try with that part also.

254
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,110
Then.

255
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,400
One, two, three, four.

256
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,180
So.

257
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,430
As you can see, I moved to the participant login page.

258
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,610
I already created participants, but for the readers I will tell you.

259
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,320
So I would say read information how we can check our information is stored.

260
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,450
So go to the skill command line.

261
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,130
But use these statements.

262
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,730
Select.

263
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,630
Data from.

264
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,860
This this in details.

265
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,730
B log in details our table name.

266
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,640
And as you can see, our James password and its username are stored.

267
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,810
Always remember the sequence should be same as you entering.

268
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,590
In Java file java servlet file.

269
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:34,490
This one should be for username a two for the password and a for for name if you want to put name first,

270
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,720
then a for.

271
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,820
And similarly you have to specify these.

272
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,640
Also inside the Runescape command line.

273
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,930
This username should be below and the name should be applied.

274
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,400
So sequence is very important.

275
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,140
Don't change the sequence.

276
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,050
So that's how we can store this part into the database in further videos.

277
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,150
I'm going to tell you how we can change that part and everything.

278
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,890
And I'm going to add event and more further parts also.
