1
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:10.470
So to read a text area inside the notepad window, first we are going to create a text area with the

2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.020
help of Java String Library.

3
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:25.680
Below this we are going to call a text area function and then name this as text area.

4
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.850
New.

5
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.900
New tech stadia.

6
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.800
Yes.

7
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.910
So here it is.

8
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.470
So the text area successfully added to the code.

9
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.050
Now we are going to add it to the constructor.

10
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.400
Yes.

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.090
So help.

12
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.090
Oh, let us first add the about section we just created in the help section.

13
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.120
Help note that about.

14
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.870
So we have added about part.

15
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.860
Now.

16
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.580
We are going to add that text area to the notepad window.

17
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.960
So that about section is succesfully added to the help button.

18
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.200
Okay.

19
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.700
This about class is added now to the text area.

20
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.130
We created a g menu items, text g text areas, g text area.

21
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.110
Now invoking it with the help of the constructor.

22
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.050
We will call it the scroll pin because the text is going to be a.

23
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.870
Scrolling stuff.

24
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.180
There is a no limit of three or four words.

25
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.050
The text can be as long as we want it to.

26
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.100
So naming this variable as a scroll pin new and.

27
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.240
This grouping.

28
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.370
So the argument passed inside is the text basically.

29
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.560
And adding the scroll pen to the frame.

30
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.240
Scroll into the frame and then.

31
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.810
Now let us try and run this.

32
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.520
So perfect.

33
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.800
The text field is added here.

34
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.920
Currently the font size is so small.

35
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.180
So let us set the font size first.

36
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.040
So increase the text size should be done as text area.

37
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.800
Not said font.

38
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:18.400
The rest of the part of sensitive plane and the size is 20.

39
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.530
Let us check if the font size has increased or not.

40
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.850
Perfect.

41
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.000
So the fonts are big and clear.

42
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:40.310
On typing something, we can see that it is going through in a horizontal manner, which is not a good

43
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.210
practice.

44
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.800
The should we come in the next line automatically and not go through the horizontal scrolling?

45
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:59.210
So to prevent this, we are going to call something in our function and prevent this from happening.

46
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.550
So we need vertical scrolling and prevent the horizontal scrolling.

47
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.840
So in the scroll pane preventing.

48
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.530
The vertical, the horizontal scrolling as.

49
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.740
Setting it as never.

50
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.410
So the g scroll pane.

51
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.390
Should call it as horizontal scrolling, never perfect.

52
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.910
And similarly, we need vertical scrolling.

53
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.210
So we will set it to as needed.

54
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.240
Just cruel pain.

55
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.410
Horizontal is done so vertical as needed.

56
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.090
Yes.

57
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.760
So now we can go and check if the scrolling part is fixed or not.

58
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.410
I'm running the program.

59
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.890
And let's try to type something.

60
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.750
I think that is something missed.

61
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.030
Let us try to fix this again.

62
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.720
The text should switch to the next line automatically.

63
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.150
So calling to method as text area set line.

64
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.240
That's true.

65
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.440
And the second one.

66
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.380
It's set it up style.

67
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.410
But I think.

68
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.700
Let us try.

69
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.630
In the next line text area, set it up style one.

70
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.030
So the word stands should be wrapped like if the horizontal line is full.

71
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.450
We should switch to the next line automatically.

72
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.700
Looking.

73
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.550
So try running this.

74
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.020
Typing something.

75
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.360
Okay.

76
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.080
Perfect.

77
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:34.310
So a text is coming in the next line automatically and the text bar is completed in this way.

78
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:42.770
Now, let us try to add some actions to these buttons, like clicking on the new button, clicking on

79
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.380
the save copy, cut, anything.

80
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.710
We have to set some actions to the button.

81
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.500
So we are going to use Action Listener for this purpose.

82
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.360
So extending this with actual listeners.

83
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.660
Action listener.

84
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:17.060
So to make things work, firstly we have to import the event class from Java NWT.

85
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.210
The Java NWT.

86
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.690
DOT event.

87
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:35.180
And exporting everything from this class we are using as a trick here so that all the classes from David

88
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.250
got imported here.

89
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.400
And in this class, we have to do a fix.

90
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.300
By implementing this method.

91
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.560
So, yes.

92
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.700
Override function is created automatically.

93
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.090
As for, I created an action listener.

94
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.990
So coming to this and adding some actions to the buttons.

95
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.730
We have already created a void class called Action Perform with Event E.

96
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.770
So firstly, we are going to add action with every action out there.

97
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.630
And actually listener.

98
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:30.420
And in the parameter we are going to pass this keyword.

99
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:36.640
So that it gets invoked as far we recall, this action.

100
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.140
Similarly for.

101
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.620
Every method.

102
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.560
New file.

103
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.740
Open file.

104
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.750
Open file.

105
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.210
Same file.

106
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.810
Green taxi and whatever.

107
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.730
I suppose to add in the buttons.

108
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.820
So save print tags it.

109
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.270
Screen exit select all caught copy paste.

110
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:24.300
Let us just end this and try to.

111
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.910
Try to add this.

112
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:38.500
So inside this action performed event created we have added action listener with every button like new

113
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:45.550
open save print, exit, copy, paste, cut, select on and about.

114
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.680
So every button in that notepad has a attached action with it.

115
00:09:51.250 --> 00:10:00.400
We use conditional operators of offenders, like if we click the new button at abstract text, abstract

116
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:07.450
button should open an area as a text area, and initially the text field should be empty.

117
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:14.890
So this function is used to create an empty text field area to set text.

118
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:19.420
And inside nothing is printed as if.

119
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.190
If we click on Open at that time, we are going to click at only one button.

120
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.940
So that's why we are using the conditional operators.

121
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.070
So suppose if you are clicking two buttons at a time, is that possible?

122
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.470
I don't think so.

123
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:48.760
So, yes, the only purpose of using and elseif conditional operators are to add actions towards a specific

124
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.530
button if click once.

125
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.760
Otherwise, if the other button is clean, what action should be performed?

126
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.380
And in the similar way, for every button we have added a function.

127
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.750
So the actions related to the buttons are added using this.

128
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.830
This override action performed class.

129
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.400
So the complete actions performed is completed.

130
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:25.220
Now in the next part, we will be looking at how to add more features to this, not a down application.
