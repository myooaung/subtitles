1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:09.030
So in previous cases, what we have done, we created a lot plant and we've done everything like handling

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
that files and everything and it's indexing.

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.830
As you can see, it is taking time to indexing and doing everything.

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.630
So let us ID to check everything and it will take time.

5
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.050
No, this is an email message.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.180
And I created the gate and certain methods.

7
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.200
So.

8
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.020
I will tell you, one shortcut to do this is I already told you place an insert.

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.970
When all the insert is you are doing, you can check for greater and certain methods here.

10
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.420
And once you click this, you can check the URL.

11
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.090
I already created a certain set of methods for everything, but instead of this you can use this, keep

12
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.890
it as it is defaulting.

13
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.830
And we created this part already.

14
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.920
So this is my mail client where I'm accessing the files using do get and everything.

15
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.290
Do get and do post not accessing the files.

16
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.800
I'm accessing the data from the JSP file, which is basically indexed for disappear.

17
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.330
So in email message, what's happening?

18
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.000
Actually, it's creating and certain methods and certain methods are nothing but gate and set methods

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.590
basically in Java.

20
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.650
So for time consumption and everything and for smart coding, what I've done, I use default things

21
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.030
using insert and I inserted these things so you can use these things directly.

22
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.290
So now what I'm going to mention here, it's very simple.

23
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.160
I already created this indexing part and now we are remaining with this.

24
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.200
Okay, so you can say new Java makes this not found and everything.

25
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.790
So I will tell you what I went to create here and everything.

26
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.180
But before this remember everything here.

27
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.730
So email utility is just basically properties of SMTP server dimension and you can remove this thing

28
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.150
also.

29
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.960
It's not at all required, but I mentioned here if you're having any trouble in my case for Gmail,

30
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.010
you don't require that.

31
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.020
But if you are using another thing or you are using your own SMTP server, you read this part.

32
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.090
Then I created one properties object a SMTP Properties Props.

33
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.790
I'm putting my host as a SMTP address or basically dot com all this file.

34
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.100
So when you cannot change the port remember I'm mentioning as authentic content location always true

35
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.660
and I'm enabling TLS with transport layer security.

36
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.870
I created this thing you with some message and it's very unsecure method I created.

37
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.670
But I will tell you what I'm going to use here.

38
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.690
So new Java X I created and session.

39
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:08.320
So let me move forward with some more creative thing here which is basically protected password authentication.

40
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.200
Not many thing, but password protection protected.

41
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.220
So.

42
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.580
Is taking them fully protected.

43
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.450
Okay.

44
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.350
Protected.

45
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.000
Crossword.

46
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.520
Protected password authentication java x mail here and mentioning authentication get.

47
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.440
Password authentication.

48
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.890
So.

49
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.850
I did not want you to get password.

50
00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.960
Applications were.

51
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.840
Maybe it is because I don't want to type in another sort of indication.

52
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.040
We've done.

53
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.530
New.

54
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.930
Password authentication.

55
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.200
And what I'm going to mention is here.

56
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.450
Senator mail.

57
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.490
Similar email pass that I'm going to mention here.

58
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.110
Okay.

59
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.500
And let me close this part.

60
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.860
No.

61
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.140
I think I remaining with some more cream here, which is basically props.

62
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.460
Do I close this?

63
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.870
No.

64
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.310
So no need to require to close this.

65
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.250
We need to close this here.

66
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.430
No.

67
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.550
No.

68
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.490
I made one mistake more because of this parenthesis.

69
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.100
Okay, now we are done.

70
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.950
So let me tell you what is going to do.

71
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.190
It is going to create a session with the following instances properties.

72
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.510
These properties with new Java Mail Authenticator, which is basically X mail authenticator file, then

73
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.340
protected password authentication.

74
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.720
Password protected authentication which is going to return me the sender email and send mail pass.

75
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.960
So I will tell you how I'm going to change it later.

76
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.280
Then I need to debug this.

77
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.910
So.

78
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.830
Decision not said debug which is always true.

79
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.620
Which is going to be true always.

80
00:05:52.950 --> 00:06:03.090
So this is it about how I'm going to work with this, but we are furthermore required to do things.

81
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:12.420
So what I can do, instead of doing these things again and again, like messaging this and sending an

82
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.930
email.

83
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.950
I'm going to create one package, insert this or begins a file, insert this.

84
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:31.350
So what I'm actually going to do is very common thing I'm mentioning as my file is password lot d x

85
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.480
in this pair I'm going to mention my password as my password and I'm going to handle this.

86
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.220
And now I'm going to create one secure, secure method for this purpose.

87
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.960
And what I hope it's very easy but file name.

88
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.230
Is equal to.

89
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.780
BOBKOFF So what a lot of.

90
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.360
And it's all in the form of actions in both class.

91
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.590
Part of.

92
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.180
And let me mention my part.

93
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.670
So you can use your password.

94
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.580
But I'm going to use you as it is.

95
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.610
So sometimes.

96
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.700
Okay.

97
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.170
So it's showing me this.

98
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:39.100
But what you can do is it should be handling dry catch always remember and high in catch because I'm

99
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.290
handling this so it needs to handle with try catch.

100
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.130
So let me try here.

101
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.490
Let me close.

102
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.310
Try here.

103
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.860
And let me mention catchier exception.

104
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.500
E.

105
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.380
System.

106
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.960
Don't.

107
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.680
Oh, Lord.

108
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.460
England.

109
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.140
So sometimes it made you error.

110
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.960
So let me add this in my vein.

111
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.700
So it gives me directly to change that, my dependencies and everything.

112
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.060
So.

113
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.000
It started, I guess, my independence, he added.

114
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.480
So it will take time doing indexing and everything.

115
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:47.190
But now what I'm going to mention here, once this password takes care of some password inside this,

116
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:55.410
it is going to handle my this thing file will take care of fetching the what we can say data inside

117
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.950
this.

118
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:05.550
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to mention as that file so files dot releasing.

119
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.650
It's metal reaching.

120
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.270
So is this the industry filing?

121
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.410
By limb.

122
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.290
This is very.

123
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.650
So it will be really strange for me.

124
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:29.900
And what I'm going to do is I'm mentioning a string class.

125
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:43.090
So now instead of putting the password here, I can put like this and this is no longer unsafe.

126
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.670
Why the password or txt?

127
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.190
I can store it as a very ciphertext.

128
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.930
Everything is basically encrypted paste.

129
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.680
You cannot check that part.

130
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:58.160
You can store it very securely or you can use database zero.

131
00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.880
So for this purpose, what?

132
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.610
I'm using this file and it will take care of everything.

133
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.790
So let me mention it is as it is.

134
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.640
Let me do one thing here.

135
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.880
Instead of waiting.

136
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.760
Always this would start.

137
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.420
Start.

138
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.910
Then we're also.

139
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:29.380
Stop because it is basically just optimizing the inputs which is no longer you.

140
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.400
Okay, so we are good to go.

141
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.930
In this.

142
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:46.830
Including the important thing the libraries and now we done with this with session debug and everything

143
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:53.890
so we are now remaining with creating message set to message, then doing that splitting part.

144
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.080
Everything we need to do.

145
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.770
So first, let us see how we can create a message field here.

146
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.580
So it's very easy to create message field here.

147
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.180
Create a message feed.

148
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:17.700
Or we can create message on the screen because it will go to the index page easily meaning.

149
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:25.580
So create message as back in part is very easy as message, image and engine.

150
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.780
New message.

151
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.960
Okay, wait a minute.

152
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.700
What happened?

153
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:38.820
Okay.

154
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.550
So.

155
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.200
I created everything for you.

156
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.230
So I want to mention this only message.

157
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.010
And what I can do is my message.

158
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.550
So.

159
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.720
It's basically Java X message.

160
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:07.090
My message is just for putting this as it is my message which is going to handle my session.

161
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.930
Session is this.

162
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:13.300
So session is going to handle this with this.

163
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.800
Then what I need to mention is.

164
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.690
Maybe you think because this is not at all because.

165
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:24.910
So

166
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.940
this is going to create a message then.

167
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.520
I knew the address from which going to put so.

168
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.170
Internet.

169
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:49.540
Internet at this Internet address, which is basically IP address, nothing but.

170
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:58.390
Address from again new year new.

171
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.410
Let me mention like this address from.

172
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:07.870
Okay, so there will be no address from new internet address and it's very easy.

173
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.630
Singerman.

174
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.430
So.

175
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.070
Let's see.

176
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.690
Then after this message, get from.

177
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.520
I need to mention you get from.

178
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.750
What is the good form which is basically addressed from.

179
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.470
So while putting the message, you can found out that part.

180
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:40.430
So might show me the error or set form.

181
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.620
I need not set it set.

182
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:50.090
So now I can say the message for not getting the message, I'm going to forward the message.

183
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.400
So I need to sit from it and not yet from.

184
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.510
So now we are done with this messaging part.

185
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:03.750
So remaining things, what I'm going to do is send to address and doing everything.

186
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.720
So let me copy one thing.

187
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.650
Email it is.

188
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:17.330
Which is basically going to fish that singing melodies then Curtis is going to mention.

189
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:29.990
So this is my kids and what is going to do if I'm putting dash or comma here, it's going to add in

190
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.580
that email.

191
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.800
So I'm using here as string, as you can say, relating.

192
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.050
So it will add it in the CC address and everything.

193
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.130
So this is my to address.

194
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.070
If I'm adding the comma, it will my CC address.

195
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.740
Then for BC address I'm going to use same thing here.

196
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.560
So let me do this again.

197
00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.110
So I will tell you what is going to work for me.

198
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:06.900
So I'm going to put slash here and address through with email IDs and this is the length.

199
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:13.500
So it's going to put and it's going to run and check to all email the ladies I given and it will put

200
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.820
me for that purpose.

201
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:23.430
So in further videos, what I'm going to do, this is done, but now we are required over some messaging

202
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.790
part.

203
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.060
We are going to create one loop to invoke it again and again.

204
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.490
So in the later part, I'm going to do this.

205
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:36.720
If you want to check, you can directly use this form or XML and it's taking time to analyze as per

206
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.650
your requirement.

207
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:47.460
So remember, while putting this, it should be like this your password here and you can use this method

208
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:52.180
to put password or instead of putting password, you can use this method.

209
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.460
Hope you understand.

210
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.180
Thank you.
