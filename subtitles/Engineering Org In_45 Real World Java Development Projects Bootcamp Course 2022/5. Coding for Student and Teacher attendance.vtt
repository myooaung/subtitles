1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.580
So here is our student attendance Java class, which is defined inside the package university.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.720
Importing the necessary packages as Q, swing a w t and a w t event packages.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.170
Then we have defined the classes student attendance, which is extending g frame and implementing action.

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.200
Listener There are the seven labels and seven text field which are expected to that labels two buttons

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.030
and three choices.

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.660
Then we have defined a non parameter as constructor of the student attendance class.

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.520
Setting the layout which is off grid layout.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.130
Type X and y will be the location of the.

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.140
Loud and.

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.830
50 plus 50 will be the size of the layout.

11
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.220
Then we have defined the choice.

12
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.430
Inside the choice we have initialize the connection with the database and then we have executed the

13
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.820
query select aspect from a student while are stored next.

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.540
So this will iterate over the record, over the student table and add every student roll number to the

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.850
choice or instance data.

16
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.010
Then we have created a label as a roll number and added to it our choice.

17
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.740
Added Joyce to the frame and added the label to the frame.

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.020
Then we created a label for staff, created the choice.

19
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.700
Three searches will be there for the attendance for staff, either present, absent or on leave.

20
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.870
So that will mean first up, similarly adding those label and choice to the frame.

21
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.890
Then we have added label of second half choice for the second half label present, absent or leave.

22
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.640
Then we have added those label and choice to the frame.

23
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.710
After that there is a button.

24
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.130
Be one submit foreground colour and background colour for it.

25
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.120
Similarly, for the button, cancel background and formula for it.

26
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.590
Adding those buttons.

27
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.570
Adding action listener to those buttons.

28
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.200
Setting the background colour of the window as white.

29
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.940
Setting the visibility as true size of the window and location of the window.

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.700
Then inside the public void action performed.

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.280
If the source of the button is a source of dependence from one button, then we will first restore inside

32
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.730
the string.

33
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.110
If the selected item from first choice instead a string as selected item item from second of choice

34
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.160
and inside data.

35
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.180
The details of the student by using new java dot utility date dot to string that will restore the date.

36
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.130
A string, I'd say to get selected item from the selected item of roll number that will store initializing

37
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.190
the query to insert into the attendance student table respective values inside the block.

38
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.780
Initializing the connection and executing the query.

39
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.380
Q are way stored in the string showing the panel dialog box as attendance confirmed.

40
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.240
Visibility of the current window as false catalog will handle an exception if occurs.

41
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.260
And else if the source of the baton is from me too, then we will set the visibility of the current

42
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.760
windows as false.

43
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.380
Inside the main function we have created the instance of the new student attendance class.

44
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.970
Let's move on to our teacher attendance Java file.

45
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.360
So this will restore the attendance of the teacher.

46
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.850
So this is defined inside the package university school.

47
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.770
If we have imported the package.

48
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.160
Autodesk Java Export Swing Java AWP, Java JWT event.

49
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.910
After that, we have defined our class, which is extending frame and implementing Excel listener.

50
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.740
There are seven labels similarly like the student tables, seven text field, two buttons and three

51
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.460
choices.

52
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.040
Inside the non parameter constructor of the teacher attendance, we have first defined the layout of

53
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.270
the grid layout.

54
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.770
Then define the C2 choice which choice will store, employ IDs from the table teacher and after that

55
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:58.790
we have added the label teacher ID and added the choice to our frame.

56
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.900
Then we have defined the label.

57
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.170
First stop initialize the choice added inside the choice we have added, present, absent and leave.

58
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.940
Then we have added the label and choice to our fame.

59
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.500
After that, we have initialized another label as second of choice for the second of present.

60
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.550
Absent or leave.

61
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.230
Then we have added.

62
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.460
Label and second off choice to our DJ frame.

63
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.370
After that there is a button be one submit background color as black for one color as white another

64
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.570
button as cancel.

65
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.640
Background color is black for one color as white.

66
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.940
And then we have defined had to be one button and add way to button adding action listener to both of

67
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.780
the buttons.

68
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.290
We went in to setting the background color of the complete window as white visibility as to setting

69
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.860
the sizes for and across for 50 locations, 600 comma, 200 inside the action performed event.

70
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.490
If the event is from the source of the event is from V1.

71
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.930
Then we will restore the selected item attendance from the first half in F.

72
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:14.250
Strong second half choice in history as the date in string d d the ID selected from the C to choice

73
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.170
in ID and create the query.

74
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.480
Insert into attendance.

75
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:26.220
Insert into attendance teacher table by values passing those values into it inside the drive log.

76
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.870
Initializing the connection.

77
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.450
Then we will updating the query by passing the string q y into the executable data statement which will

78
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.670
be executed by using the statement instance and.

79
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.990
Connection and start of the class con which we have just created.

80
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.450
Then we have displayed the dialogue box that attendance confirmed and setting the visibility of the

81
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.950
current window.

82
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.590
As for the cans block will handle and the exception if occurs.

83
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.890
As the source of the baton is from me too.

84
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.940
That is the cancel button.

85
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.820
So that will just close this window.

86
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.810
So setting the visibility of the current instance of the class as false inside the main function, we

87
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.650
have just created an instance of the teacher in this class.

88
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.980
So let's move to the where the last.

89
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.470
Class of this video that is student attendance details.

90
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.770
So this class is also.

91
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.020
Define inside the package university.

92
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.580
We have imported Java dot as well to connect with the database java searching to provide a graphical

93
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.260
user interface.

94
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:35.110
Java, Abstract Window Toolkit and Abstract Toolkit event to handle events on our this window, then

95
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.900
public classes to then add attendance details which is extending the frame.

96
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.280
Implementing Action Listener.

97
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.140
Then there is a table one.

98
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.090
J button b one and a string edge.

99
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.410
That is a roll number.

100
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.320
It all the string that is roll number, date time, first up and second up.

101
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.900
Then there is a two dimensional array or.

102
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.040
Office strength 15 plus four.

103
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.320
IMJ will be used to iterate over these.

104
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.500
Two dimensionality.

105
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:17.580
Now we have defined a non constricted view student attendance size 18 Red Cross 300 location as 415

106
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.780
common 150.

107
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.280
And then we have.

108
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.930
Inside a dry block for the string.

109
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.550
Q We have select extract from a student, extract from attendance student.

110
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.240
This will select the attend all the record from the attendance student.

111
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.810
Initializing the connection, executing the query, which we have stored in our string.

112
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.580
Q Iterating over the record of the attendance student table.

113
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.260
Distorting the respective details of every role in our two dimensional array.

114
00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:00.660
Incrementing the AI variable every time in my loop and initializing the JS course to zero whenever the

115
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.570
loop will execute or iterate again.

116
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.680
Initializing the table by passing the two dimensional array in the column area.

117
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.000
BLOCK will handle any exception.

118
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.780
If, of course.

119
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.980
And.

120
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.280
Inside the be one button.

121
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.810
We have defined the button one which is print and add b1 comma south.

122
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.460
So button will be added to the respective place.

123
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.430
A scroll panel adding the scroll panel to the window, adding action listener to the button.

124
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.200
So if the print button has been pressed, then we will call g1 print.

125
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.190
Okay.

126
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:45.080
So it will call G or print cash the exception if an exception occurs.

127
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.980
So inside.

128
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.820
A static admin method.

129
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.090
We have called the student attendance detail.

130
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.280
Setting the visibility as true.

131
00:08:54.610 --> 00:09:02.740
So in this video we have learned about the student attendance, how we will be storing the student attendance,

132
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:09.220
teacher attendance, and how we'll be showing or viewing the student attendance, how we can see the

133
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.750
student attendance details.

134
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.950
So let's have a look run of these three classes.

135
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.260
I'll be running first login.

136
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.380
Validating details.

137
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.710
Logan.

138
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.660
This is the result of project class.

139
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.550
Then inside the attendance, first student attendance.

140
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.470
Click on this.

141
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.420
So this is the Windows student in attendance.

142
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.330
Here it will show you the roll number.

143
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.340
So as we have not had any student, so it is not showing the roll number you can select first up, either

144
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.790
present, absent or leave.

145
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.830
Similarly for the second half, either present absent of leave.

146
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.080
And if I click on submit.

147
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.660
So it's showing attendance confirmed.

148
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.620
Then for the teacher.

149
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.230
Then similarly we can add for the teacher, Dennis as well.

150
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.890
And let's click on Cancel.

151
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.120
And attendance detail.

152
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.310
We can check student attendance detail.

153
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.980
So this is data on student attendance detail.

154
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.130
We have not added the roll number and we have just click on submit.

155
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.760
So it has added the detail without the roll number.

156
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.350
So this is the.

157
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.510
This is how we can have a look on the struggling attendance detail similarly for the teacher attendance

158
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:29.870
details.

159
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.610
But we will be looking at the teacher attendance class and implementation and line by line explanation

160
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:40.940
of the teacher attendance detail class in our next video and two more classes.
