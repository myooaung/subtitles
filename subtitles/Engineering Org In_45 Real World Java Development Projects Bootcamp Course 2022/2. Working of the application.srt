00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,690
So I hope that you all have been through the introduction part of the application in Java that we are

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,130
going to make today.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:19,260
And after that introduction you must have gained a draft idea about what actually we are going to make

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:27,630
in this project and what are the concepts we are going to learn while making this project and what are

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:36,090
the specifications of this project overall that we will be looking up to while making this project?

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,770
What should be kept in mind before starting to make this project?

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,360
So in this part we will be looking up to what is the working of this application, how actually this

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,820
application works, what are the functionalities attached in this app?

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:02,460
And also like what will be the final output of running everything and we will see that.

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:11,880
So this is the window which is going to open when you will run the application in your compilers or

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,310
from the icons which we will make on the completion of the project.

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:28,680
So yes, we can see that there is a frame basically inside the frame that is like Title MENUBAR title

14
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,510
is the component of the frame framework which we are using.

15
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,680
I have told about it it was Swing and AWP.

16
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,390
We will be using these two frameworks while making this application.

17
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:51,540
So this is the title containing a Java coffee mug icon and order as the title of this window.

18
00:01:51,540 --> 00:02:02,090
Okay, so inside this application there are some options and first options as for size, that is a dropdown

19
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,430
down test asking for small or medium large.

20
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:14,070
So on selecting any one of them, it will be displayed here large and then we are being asked for select

21
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,010
which type of beverage you want to order.

22
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,650
So we will be choosing one of these to check how actually it works.

23
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,340
So suppose I am going to select coffee.

24
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,150
So we are ordering large coffee.

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,680
And how many glasses?

26
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:41,700
So suppose I want to order six glasses of coffee and you can see that initially the order button is

27
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,020
like a light.

28
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,650
It is not clearly visible, visible.

29
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,140
It is like a paring light light border.

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,910
That is no highlight to this button.

31
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:03,480
Once we will click add, then automatically this order button will be in like come in a different color

32
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,610
similarly like this red button.

33
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,850
So currently this order button is non-functional.

34
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Once we will add something to the cart, then only this order button will become functional and change

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,420
its color automatically instead of being this grey like looking.

36
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,480
So I am clicking on this add button.

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,000
So this dialog box up there asking me for add ons.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,910
So suppose if I want to add milk to my coffee, are there are people who prefer coffee without milk

39
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,050
like diet conscious people so they will be clicking?

40
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,710
No.

41
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,620
Then the order will be made in that terms only.

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,650
But suppose I want to add to it to check how it works.

43
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,510
So would you like milk?

44
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,120
Yes, I would like to add milk.

45
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,530
So six large glasses of coffee with milk added.

46
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,900
So we have successfully added six glasses of coffee with milk.

47
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:15,750
Now you can see that this order button highlighted up and now we can click on order so that yes.

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:26,100
So again, a message or dialog box appeared and six large glasses of coffee with milk will cost me 58.5

49
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,730
like currency units, whatever it could be.

50
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:38,970
And once I will click, okay, so this dialog box, then again a dialog box will appear showing me that

51
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,240
how much I should pay for this application.

52
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,660
Like what is the total amount to be paid by me once I will check out the card.

53
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,450
So this is the like overall process of ordering something.

54
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,650
So I am clicking.

55
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, so everything is now like previous.

56
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,560
The like.

57
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:12,060
The initial state application jumps back to the running state initial window opened and now we will

58
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:20,490
try adding more than one thing to the like cart and then we will try checking out to see what actually

59
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,170
happens.

60
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,980
So suppose the size remains medium and I am ordering a juice of five glasses of juice and then I am

61
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,630
clicking on this add button.

62
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,480
So this is a new thing which we haven't talked about.

63
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,830
So I wanted it to discuss in the working part for a better understanding of this thing.

64
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:51,030
So one more dialog box is attached to this application asking for flavors of juice.

65
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,890
Like what?

66
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,760
What things?

67
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,260
Juice we want to order.

68
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,200
So suppose I want pineapple juice.

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:05,070
So we have selected this fruit in the dialog box as well.

70
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,390
So this dialog box is containing our dropdown menu.

71
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:18,000
It is a dialog box itself, it contains a dropdown menu and again the cancel button to confirm.

72
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,710
So I am clicking.

73
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,310
Okay.

74
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,820
And then 5 million glasses of pineapple juice added.

75
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,600
Perfect.

76
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:35,070
So suppose now again I want to order or the size should be support small and suppose again I want to

77
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,860
order five glasses of B so I'm clicking and it is asking for would you like sugar?

78
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:49,650
So it depends on the like user whether he or she wants to add sugar to the tea or not.

79
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,950
So suppose I want to add sugar on clicking?

80
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,550
Yes.

81
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,490
Five small glasses of tea with sugar added.

82
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,520
So these two things are added to the cart.

83
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,670
Now I wish to like check out.

84
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,750
I did not want to order anything else so I'm clicking order.

85
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:14,910
So to see this dialog box pair displaying that what actually I have added to my cart and what is the

86
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,700
cost attached to these specific items.

87
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:28,770
So 5 million glasses of pineapple juice costs 52.5 and five small glasses of tea with sugar costs 18.75.

88
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,630
So it is perfect.

89
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,950
We have ordered two things and the message is showing the same.

90
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,470
So everything is working fine now.

91
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,160
On clicking.

92
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:50,760
Okay, so the total amount to be paid by me is 71.25 units of currency and this is like adding the amount.

93
00:07:50,760 --> 00:08:01,350
So we have 51.25 and like I am not remember remembering the data but they are adding the cost of the

94
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,330
tea and the juice.

95
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:13,440
So this is also a special functionalities attached in this application are for totaling the items cost

96
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,130
and then displaying this in a separate dialog box.

97
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,750
So on clicking.

98
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,410
Okay.

99
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,890
Yes.

100
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,550
So perfect.

101
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:28,080
We are back to the previous window which was opened when we run the application and we have ordered

102
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,980
two things.

103
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,370
So everything was working perfectly fine now.

104
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:41,650
So you have gained all the idea about the working of this application and I hope that you must be like

105
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:49,500
excited in order to learn how to write the program of this application on your own, learning every

106
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:59,460
concept behind the program, and then complete this application to learn more and more concepts in Java.

107
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:07,830
So here we will be like writing the prototype of the application, which we are going to make today.

108
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:16,260
So what actually are the requirements that will be kept in mind before creating the application?

109
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:29,790
So firstly, we have to create a new Java project in the ID, a new project in ideas of our choices.

110
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,650
Like we will be using Visual Studio code for creating this project.

111
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,130
So firstly we will be creating a new project.

112
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:44,250
Secondly, we will be like creating classes inside the project.

113
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,900
So creating.

114
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,310
Main class first.

115
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:58,940
So the main class will be responsible for testing and running of the application, responsible for testing

116
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,930
and running of the application.

117
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:11,510
So whenever we will be like making things like putting things together and then we will be checking

118
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,300
that how things are working or not.

119
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:21,020
In each step we will be running the main class only, not any other class so responsible for testing

120
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,600
and running of the app.

121
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay, so after the creation of the main class now we will be creating separate classes for each of

122
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,570
the like you have.

123
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:43,130
You must have seen that every order was asking for a different add on.

124
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:53,030
So in order to make things like different from each what we can say that menu items so we have to get

125
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,690
the different menu items with different add ons.

126
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,550
So we should be creating different classes for each item.

127
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:12,230
So, okay, so as a whole we will be creating a beverage class for like consisting all the items in

128
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:20,810
the menu and after which we will be creating separate classes for each of the items in the menu.

129
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:29,000
Suppose we had coffee, juice and what else we had.

130
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,380
I think it was three and our.

131
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,980
Yes.

132
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:41,090
So we have ordered so we have to order things from these four options only.

133
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:50,600
So we will be creating four different classes for the menu items in order to attach like the add ons

134
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,420
which they were asking for separately.

135
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,460
Like there was nothing combined.

136
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,370
They were asking for different items.

137
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:10,730
Suppose coffee was asking for is it was milk or juice was asking for flavours like we chose pineapple.

138
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,320
I think so.

139
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,920
Flavour.

140
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,090
So we will be attaching everything separately in these classes.

141
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:25,460
Only tables asking for sugar and water was asking for ice, of course.

142
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:34,700
So we will be like attaching everything in these classes separately and after which we will be having

143
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,250
a total of five classes.

144
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,140
So in the fifth step we will be having total of five classes.

145
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,790
This is amazing.

146
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:51,050
Total of five classes to be made in order to complete this project.

147
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,460
To be made.

148
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,560
So to be made.

149
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:06,540
So we have like a rough idea about what we are going to make while like creating this project in our

150
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:13,230
compiler side or whatever we see and after the creation of these five classes.

151
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,850
Except for the main class like we have for things, for the menu items and our beverage class which

152
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,850
will be consisting all the items in the menu in a combined manner.

153
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:33,990
And okay, so if we are main class also, so we will be creating six classes as a whole and this main

154
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,810
class will be consisting on the form.

155
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,650
Yes.

156
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,710
So basically it is a form and we are filling this form in order to complete our orders.

157
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:49,050
So here now we're like gathering all the idea about this application.

158
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:57,480
In the next part we will be looking up to creating of a new project in our compilers and then starting

159
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,700
coding part of this project.

160
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,250
So see you in the next part with the creation of a new project in the compiler.

161
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,490
Thank you.
