00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,740
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,430
In that series of learning how to make projects in Java.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,980
Today we are going to start learning a new project that TA in Java.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,100
So the name of the project is Food Ordering System.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:27,660
So this is an application, a GI application made in Java and it is headed as a food ordering system.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,640
So this is the like interface of the application.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:42,390
You can see it on your screens that the frame contains like several fields which asks for a selection

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:50,640
of size, select which type of beverage you want to order, and there are some radio buttons from which

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,170
we have to select that.

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:01,670
What we want to order like that is the input field which asks for how many glasses we want, like a

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:11,520
quantity of these items we have to enter here in numeric form so that the our system like calculates

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:20,100
how many glasses you have to order and according to it, what will be the prices of the whole card.

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,810
So this is going to be the home page of the application.

14
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,390
Like when the window opens, this interface will be visible to the user.

15
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:38,940
Now after with this dropdown button like Select Size is the name of the label and inside which there

16
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,730
is a dropdown asking for the size of the item which we want to order.

17
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:50,190
So there are three options here small, medium and large.

18
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:57,870
So we have to select one of them from these three, after which we have to select the type of beverage

19
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,430
like we want to order.

20
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:08,040
So currently we are showing four options mentioned as juice, water, tea, coffee and like we can change

21
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,080
it according to our convenience.

22
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,380
When we are making the application, it's upon us that what we want to keep in the like radio button

23
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,890
options.

24
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,170
So below this there is a yes ahead.

25
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:30,060
You can see I have entered five and this will be the quantity of water I want to add to the cart.

26
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,630
So there are two buttons and an order.

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:43,380
So on clicking the add button the like a checkbox will appear like not a checkbox, but a dialog box

28
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,050
will appear asking for eyes.

29
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,760
Like if I want to add eyes to the beverage, I want to order.

30
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,340
So if I wish to arise, I have to click yes in this dialog box.

31
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,770
And if not, then I have to click no.

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,490
So when I will click yes, then automatically the card will be updated with a glass of water.

33
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:16,110
Like here we have five glasses of water, medium size of glasses, and also adults eyes will be added

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,760
to our glasses.

35
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,910
Okay.

36
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:28,980
So we have total yes, five medium glasses of water with eyes and it will appear on the screen so that

37
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,700
you can see that what actually you have added to the cart and what actually you have ordered.

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,620
So in this there are two buttons on hold called as ADD and order.

39
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:53,220
So on clicking and the item will be added to the cart and you can select other options from the menu.

40
00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:01,920
Also that I suppose you want two things to order, so you can order this by using cart and once you

41
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,250
have like completed all the selections you want to make, you have to click on this order button.

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:16,920
So in the next slide we can see that yes, we have order option and on clicking order option, a message

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:25,350
appears like it is also a dialog box containing the like total some of our order that we have ordered

44
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,950
for.

45
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:33,900
So five medium glasses of water with eyes and this is the price we have to pay.

46
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:42,510
So 5 million glasses of water with ice costs 12.5 like what is the currency?

47
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,210
You can set it according to your own.

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,800
And these two buttons functions in a totally different way.

49
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:57,540
This add button helps us to add items to our cart and then again like gives us the options to select

50
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,580
more items from the menu.

51
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,470
And then again add it to CART.

52
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,590
And once we finalize our ordering, then we can click on this order button.

53
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,950
Then this message dialog box will appear, start showing us that of what we have actually finalizing

54
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:22,350
to order and once we will click okay then another dialog box will appear which showing a message of

55
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,540
you should pay 12.5 and whatever the currency is.

56
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,330
So yes, they are on clicking this.

57
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:39,270
Okay, finally your order will be completed and you will again like visit the same homepage like this.

58
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,400
So on finalizing the order you can like complete everything.

59
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,160
So this was the basic like idea of the application.

60
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:59,250
Now next we will look up to what are the specifications of the project which we are going to make today.

61
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,480
So this is basically a food ordering system.

62
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,620
So we are going to manage everything about the food ordering system.

63
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:16,890
We can add items to the cart to attach add ons to it like we have seen that we were attaching eyes to

64
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,790
water.

65
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:26,640
Also we can confirm our order or once we have finished like selecting the items and the cart is full,

66
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,110
then we have to check out.

67
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,750
Then we will click on the order button.

68
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:37,460
Also at the last on the completion of the order, the pop up will appear like a dialog box.

69
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:47,280
So again we have already seen which will ask for what is the money to be paid by the like user and the

70
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,240
final amount to be paid will be also displayed in on clicking.

71
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,990
Okay, a separate a separate dialog box will appear and the final amount of money which we have to pay

72
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,060
for whatever we have ordered.

73
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:08,370
So these are the specifications of the project like the food ordering system which we are going to make

74
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:08,970
today.

75
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:18,240
So now you may be wondering that on making this project there should be something concept based like

76
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,600
logic, which we will learn after completion of this project, like on successful completion of this

77
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,200
project.

78
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,360
And the project will be working fine.

79
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,130
Everything will be like with no box, there will be no exceptions.

80
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,760
Then what are the like?

81
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,890
Things which we will logics concept, we will be learning on completion of the project and you are no

82
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,370
wrong.

83
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:50,040
So this question will naturally arise in your mind that what will you learn on making this project?

84
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,860
On learning the concepts of this project?

85
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,010
So this project is made in Java.

86
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,150
This is basically a Java GUI application which will have a test window interface.

87
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:12,090
We will be like operating this application on our desktops and the interface will open and in a separate

88
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,750
window the app will have us like Icon.

89
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,880
We have icons in our desktop.

90
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:25,500
Similarly, this app will have an icon and icon and that will open a separate window of the application

91
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,450
and then we will be performing the tasks involved with this application.

92
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,080
Okay.

93
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,640
So the concepts which we are going to learn on completion of this project is object oriented programming

94
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,420
in Java.

95
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,620
So this project is based on object oriented programming.

96
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:44,600
Okay.

97
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,440
So objects are real world entities, which are we like?

98
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,250
We have to handle real world and real world data.

99
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,470
Real world objects are going to be handled by making this project.

100
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,550
That is a difference in object oriented programming and the conventional process oriented programming

101
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,980
that we do not have any methods of tackling real world entities.

102
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,850
But in object oriented programming, we have that facility that we can tackle everything about real

103
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,710
world entities.

104
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,020
So yes, we are going to learn the object oriented programming concept and handle all the real world

105
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,800
entities.

106
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:33,570
Also, we are going to be building a Java application, so of course we will learn a lot about Java

107
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,890
programming language.

108
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,800
Java is a very interesting programming language.

109
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,820
We all know that.

110
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,590
That's why we are here and learning how to make applications in Java.

111
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:51,000
So this is the first benefit that Java is a language where we can make like real world application,

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,160
real like this applications are applicable in our daily lives.

113
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,580
So Java is that beneficial with the help.

114
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:06,250
Eight celebrities we had mentioned, two of them had swing and AWP frameworks.

115
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,440
So in this application there will be extensive use of swing and AWP frameworks.

116
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:22,640
So these two are basically like toolkits in which we are going to like put up things and then add functionality

117
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,540
to everything.

118
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,300
Like suppose that it will be offline.

119
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:33,920
So the frame is going to contain a panel and inside the panel we will be really having our input fields,

120
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,830
buttons and like yes, the dropdown box and everything like the dialog box will was appearing asking

121
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,910
for yes, no.

122
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,040
So once we will be checking out.

123
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,960
So everything is enclosed inside a toolkit and that toolkit is provided to us with the mercy of these

124
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,020
libraries we call Spring and AWP.

125
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:05,930
AWP stands for Abstract Window Toolkit, and this helps us in making the UI application like best window

126
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,880
interface applications are made using these spring and AWP frameworks.

127
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:19,940
So yes, these are beneficial to the like learners who aspire to develop applications in Java.

128
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:28,490
Also, we will be learning a Java food ordering system which is like no wonder we have we are making

129
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,730
a food ordering system so we will learn how to make a food ordering system in Java as well.

130
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,790
And classes and objects are going to be extensively used inside this application.

131
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:48,110
So if there are object oriented programming, there will be classes and objects for sure and there is

132
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,770
no wonder.

133
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:57,320
And so like everything we are going to learn while making this application is listed here, we will

134
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,760
be learning a lot of things after the completion of this project.

135
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:11,570
We will be like with a full mind concepts of object oriented programming, showing any frameworks like

136
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:23,270
giving us like what we can say that a teaser like the teaser to Swing and AWP is a frame, a text button,

137
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,740
a menu bar.

138
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:33,620
And there are so many components of these packages which we are going to embed in our application and

139
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:42,680
then see how easy it becomes to put up things by just importing a simple component of these library

140
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:51,080
and things make them so simple that we do not have to light a write up plenty of code to fix things.

141
00:12:51,080 --> 00:13:00,380
We just have to simply add a single line statement like import this and everything is going to like

142
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:07,190
already import it to your project and just you have to call it again and again and everything will work

143
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,730
properly fine without any complexities.

144
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:17,900
So yes, I hope you have gained our like a rough idea about what actually we are going to make today.

145
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:26,660
This is a food ordering system with a functional functionality attached with these buttons and order

146
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,200
and we have to select these options from here.

147
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:39,220
Also, we will be asked for the items, we will be asked for size, we will be asked for quantities

148
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,580
we want to order.

149
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,580
And then we have to add things to the cart.

150
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:50,840
If we want to add more things, or we can simply press this order button to checkout from this cart.

151
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:58,010
On clicking this order, we will be like shown a message that what actually we have ordered.

152
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:05,900
This is a sort of confirmation and also at last you will be shown what actually you have to pay.

153
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,120
So, yes, this exactly.

154
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,840
It was.

155
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,440
Now, in the next part, we will be learning what how this application works actually.

156
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,070
And then the prototype to the code, which we are going to write in order to make this application.

157
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,810
So save in the next part with the complete project tutorial.

158
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,130
Yes.

159
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,510
So see you then.
