1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:10,530
So in the previous part parts, what we did is we creating we created one class with some scanner method,

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,290
private strings, first name, last name, department email or the email generation application.

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,420
Or we can say email administration application.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,350
Inside this we created one constructor name as email.

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,750
We created some methods for generate email asking departments, then generate random password.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,610
This is a very important method to how we are using random thing here.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,650
Random is user not.

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,050
It's not user defined, it's system defined.

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,350
Or we can say java defined already library in Java then set password here.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:49,170
This is also very important and I can say for this very lengthy part of our project.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,770
So what we did is from the user, it will ask for password, it will ask for the current password.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,780
If password matches, it will tell that user you can change the new password, but if not, your current

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,740
password is wrong.

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,720
It will throw that error incorrect password and you will be out of the that part.

15
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,110
So.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:20,150
Let's see how we can use this part, like how we can run this part before that we are not running this

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,630
part.

18
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,480
But if you want to run this part, you need to create main method.

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,210
So why I'm using your object oriented, you can see this is email.

20
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:39,080
I can just put this like I created main method here and I can invoke this, but it is not very good

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,250
practice as this code is already very lengthy as you can see.

22
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,330
Now, what I can do, I can create one another class in that I can create one object for this email.

23
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:55,580
It will very helpful to execute also and very helpful to understand including this.

24
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,000
I can use that methods again then again.

25
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,430
So this is very significant method in Java for the object oriented design.

26
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,210
Now how we can create one another class is very simple as we created that email class.

27
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:17,840
Now similarly like that, just go to this email package, email package, right click here.

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,190
It will give the options.

29
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,180
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,480
Right.

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,260
Click here.

32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,110
This part.

33
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,960
This should give your all the options.

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,550
Now, wait a minute.

35
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,280
It will take time to load everything.

36
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,990
This right here.

37
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,860
As you can see, new part I want to create Java class here.

38
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,880
Java class.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,550
And I'm going to put names, email.

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,740
At.

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:59,430
So as you can see, both in other similar package and our app is created or our classes created this

42
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,920
package email app and our app is created.

43
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,950
So before proceeding with this, I will import the important method import java dot util.

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,280
As you can see, this is very important library and we are already done with this library.

45
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,290
No.

46
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,580
In this, I'm going to create a main method which is basically PSV and public static void public and

47
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,470
it will run our program.

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,630
Again.

49
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,280
I'm going to create a scanner.

50
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,240
A see.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,810
Or you can say it's similar to that scanner.

52
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,740
System not in.

53
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,570
System not in.

54
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,370
Yeah.

55
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,900
Then after this.

56
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,730
What I will do.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,590
I will ask for a user to put your name and their first name.

58
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,360
Then string.

59
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,040
Written string.

60
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,030
If Nim is equal to a lot, also is not next.

61
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,760
So or you can use next line also here or you can use next year also.

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,240
So I'm going to use next only not the next line or something.

63
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,530
Then again system dot dot println.

64
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,000
Enter LastName.

65
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,970
And then lastly.

66
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,560
Then

67
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,830
string.

68
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,830
Any name is equal to as dot.

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,300
Next.

70
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,140
That's it.

71
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,960
So we are done with this.

72
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,450
Now I want to create some.

73
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,240
New employee.

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,340
I want to generate new employee.

75
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,950
So we already created this email.

76
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,620
Now I want to invoke it this class to this class, that email class.

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,620
All I can do is I will first put here, like in here only.

78
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,420
Oh user.

79
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,440
In full.

80
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,040
Like this.

81
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,710
No.

82
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,980
Creating object.

83
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,380
Or.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,380
E.M. Glass.

85
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:40,340
Email that email part e mail M1 or I can say object one I'm going to put your M1 is equal to new.

86
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,210
Email.

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,550
That's it.

88
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:52,900
But remember, before that, what I'm putting is here problem is this this constant constructor, first

89
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,950
name and last name.

90
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,760
That's why I'm asking user to put the first name and last name.

91
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,160
So I will put here like this.

92
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,030
If name.

93
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,560
And that last part.

94
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:06,950
Now.

95
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,450
There is no error in this part.

96
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,760
So it will generate new.

97
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,490
First name and last name.

98
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:24,580
But before that, you remember we created too many methods for generating new password and then alternate

99
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,470
mail mailbox capacity.

100
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,810
And we are going to go to further also to see how we can proceed with this.

101
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,640
What I can do is I will put your choice.

102
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,620
I'm putting you is equal to minus one because you can use it to flag also thing.

103
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,080
But I want to invoke it again and again.

104
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,580
So for this I will use do y loop do y loop is similarly like that we created already system.

105
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,300
Dot dot println.

106
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:06,540
Then in this next line that starts to start something like then enter your choice or symbol.

107
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,910
Again, I'm putting Slash in here.

108
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,060
And this is only for the what I can say.

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,390
Do you part or not?

110
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:17,880
Did you?

111
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,230
But for some user interface only.

112
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,780
Want to show info.

113
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,010
I'm putting it like that.

114
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,610
When?

115
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,180
For sure.

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,330
In full.

117
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,310
Then.

118
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,940
Two for change password.

119
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,360
Then.

120
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,260
Three, four.

121
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,280
Change.

122
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,820
Mail box capacity.

123
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,290
Smashing.

124
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,880
Fought for money to build the spaces.

125
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,370
Set alternate men.

126
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:15,980
And FYI for exit, I want to create one exit method also by front exit slash and you exit.

127
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,640
That's it.

128
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,110
Now we are done with this.

129
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,350
Now inside this, do I?

130
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,020
Look, I'm going to ask choice.

131
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,900
Choice is equal to as dot next.

132
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,780
As this is integer part.

133
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,950
It's not an accent switch case.

134
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,580
Choice.

135
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,630
And.

136
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,860
This one.

137
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,420
Is this when he's showing.

138
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,660
So, as you know, we created this variable.

139
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,570
Now what I can do is just m one.

140
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,340
That object.

141
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,970
Dot, we know we have method get info.

142
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,050
In that part, we know we have one method called get info we already created.

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,270
So I'm just using that method.

144
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,120
After this.

145
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,300
Don't forget to put brakes statement.

146
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,890
Otherwise it will show again and again that method.

147
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,780
Then this too.

148
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,800
This too, is.

149
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,090
Change password.

150
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,130
In one set password.

151
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,590
Mr..

152
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,740
Think again.

153
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,100
Yes.

154
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,000
Three.

155
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,460
In one dot.

156
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,440
Set male capacity again.

157
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,610
Break statement here.

158
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,380
Then this all.

159
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,250
What is this case for?

160
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,190
For setting alternate mind set.

161
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,120
Alternate methods alternate my only.

162
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,480
Back again.

163
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,270
Recruitment.

164
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,070
And I guess for you it's nothing but just for exiting part.

165
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
So what I can do is for you.

166
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,040
System.

167
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,470
Lord.

168
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,740
Oh, Ritalin.

169
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,570
Thank.

170
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,630
You for using system.

171
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,020
Or I guess it application.

172
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,730
And after this break.

173
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,620
And there should be one default condition here.

174
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,930
As you can see, it is very good practice to create default condition.

175
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,930
System.

176
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,400
Not.

177
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,820
Dot printed in.

178
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,010
In her choice.

179
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,650
And third, but.

180
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,420
Choice again.

181
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,250
Before that I will put your slash and.

182
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,420
To our.

183
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,040
This.

184
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,530
Joyce.

185
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,300
Joyce again.

186
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,080
Okay.

187
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,230
So we are done with this.

188
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,100
Now I want to exit this part.

189
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,450
Already created this file.

190
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,310
So while I already explain to you about how we can use.

191
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,310
And that for you, if I put you, it will exceed that.

192
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,300
So we are done with this part.

193
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,590
So we can run this part.

194
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:48,470
But thing is, we are remaining with our creating file and storing into that file and creating one executable

195
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,860
file.

196
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,360
So I'm going to show you or I'm going to run this part.

197
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,100
In simple scenario.

198
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,770
To running.

199
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:04,520
You can go to this also this all over the strip, top strip and you can see there is run.

200
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,230
Our shortcut is all shift f10 windows or you can check for other systems also.

201
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,490
Or you can use add configuration but simply wait.

202
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,750
That is you can see here that the green arrow to run this part.

203
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,240
So it will ask me run email about me.

204
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,130
So it will run this email app.

205
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,450
And as you can see, configuration director, it will automatically detect configuration.

206
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,920
It will set that configuration.

207
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,060
Now in this part, you can see.

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,600
All the building process here.

209
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,580
This is output and everything.

210
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,830
So what application is building?

211
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,210
So it will take time to compile, then configuration, then directories and checking all everything.

212
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,980
So as you can see.

213
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,050
In this run configuration, our app is successfully deployed or I can say running.

214
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,370
So this is a very simple app.

215
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,820
You can enhance it to more something like web app or something like that.

216
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,920
But this is just the back end of our app.

217
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,550
So I will put here like.

218
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,150
James.

219
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,020
My last name is.

220
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,200
B, James.

221
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,950
B only.

222
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,990
So new employees.

223
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,680
James V.

224
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,550
Oh, no.

225
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,150
What is its department?

226
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,400
I'm sitting through the sales department.

227
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,690
Now I want to show you your info.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,960
So as you can see, he's in for James.

229
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,170
Don't be company, as I told you.

230
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,900
Name is James.

231
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,260
V password is this mailbox capacity.

232
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,330
And I'm not printing any.

233
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,980
So in the further part I will show you how to you can modify this also.

234
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,400
So this is for just, I'm sure about how we can run.

235
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,560
So I just stop this process.

236
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,410
You're only.

237
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,660
So let us see how we can.

238
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,260
Move further.

239
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,150
So I just created one simple scenario here.

240
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:11,670
Let us add some this also because there is some mistakes here also.

241
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,850
Emile said then.

242
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,880
New employee.

243
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,220
Also, there is one mistake that there is no gap between two.

244
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,540
This.

245
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,190
So this will help.

246
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,480
So now let's run that method again.

247
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,850
So as you can see, this is very back end or this is very primary.

248
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:40,420
But here what we understood that how we can create object oriented design, how we can create system

249
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,860
default methods, use random gems be.

250
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,380
Or I'm pulling for three accounting department now.

251
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,110
Now for this, you can see all the information.

252
00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:01,300
Let us see how we can use change password and enter current password.

253
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,770
So this is current password.

254
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:11,410
Currently I'm copy pasting this part only because I want don't want to waste time on that.

255
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,130
So it will ask for me and a new password.

256
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,330
So I will put one, two, three.

257
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,800
Plus.

258
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,760
Password change successfully.

259
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,160
Now, if I'm showing the info, you can see one, two, three, plus the password is changed.

260
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,220
And I'm not putting any alternate.

261
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,420
You can set alternate.

262
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,980
Let's put alternate gems.

263
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,390
Be at the rate gmail.com.

264
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,270
And if I'm putting that, you can see alternate set.

265
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,980
You can set everything.

266
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:53,080
Let's change mailbox capacity and put in your 1000 mailbox capacity changed again, you can see 1000.

267
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,090
So we created this.

268
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,690
So this is back end part of our project.
