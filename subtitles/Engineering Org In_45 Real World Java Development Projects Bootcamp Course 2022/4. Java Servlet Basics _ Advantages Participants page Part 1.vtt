WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.250
In previous sessions I told you about all things related to service that we created.

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.540
Index dot html.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.070
Then we created one html file inside a web pages folder, a log in, which is basically a log in to

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.020
display admin log in methods.

5
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.080
So now I'm closing this because we are done with that admin login and everything.

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.670
But as I told you so this is basically Java servlet.

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.780
But now we are going to deal with database Java servlet and our HTML.

8
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.290
So before that, I'm going to use your Oracle database.

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.780
So always remember the Oracle database services 80, 80.

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.260
That number is 88.

11
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.090
When you are installing, we will understand that.

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.940
So before installing Oracle GBC, there is one important step.

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.530
You have to change the.

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.770
Server port for glass feed server.

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.850
If you go to the libraries, you can see there is glass free server and in the tools of the ID, which

16
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.720
is NetBeans.

17
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.160
You can go to tools.

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.770
There is the server option.

19
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.290
Go to that server option.

20
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.110
You can see I change the port 8082 to 2000.

21
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.020
In your site you can see HTTP port is 88, which is basically default port for local host.

22
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.740
But I'm going to use your 202002.

23
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.430
I'm going I change this how I can change this.

24
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.630
So in where the installation is located on Mac or Windows system, in the Windows system you have to

25
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.560
go to the Sierra, which is main drive, then uses your computer name.

26
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.130
There you will find a glass fish server folder by default.

27
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:51.600
Location is that you can change the location, go to that part or then go to that domain dot xml.

28
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.080
So my location is domain switched domains domain one config domain dot xml.

29
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.450
You can find all the port numbers and everything.

30
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.370
So open any that part in ID or something.

31
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.310
Notepad, notepad plus plus any code editor, then search for your port number.

32
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.980
So I change port 2 to 0 zero two.

33
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:25.060
Your port is 88, so 88 is not more located here as you can see, 20i change 22002 So instead of 88

34
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.030
you can change these 2 to 0 zero two not allocated port on your system change do not allocate airport

35
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.130
so to 002 is free on my system so I can deploy this to 2002 server press and save this part.

36
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.720
Now you can.

37
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.330
Proceed with your installation of Oracle database.

38
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.150
So as you can see in the server of ID, your local list port is now changed, so mine is already changed

39
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.060
to 2002.

40
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.920
In your case, 88 change to another while installing you can also change with specifying another server

41
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.180
name or something like that.

42
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.410
So this is for installing Oracle database, many of which you will find during this installation.

43
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.330
Once is installation done?

44
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.780
Open the run SQL Command here, which is basically Oracle SQL Plus plus command.

45
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.330
So to connect to a school board this executing, we are going to execute using this only we are not

46
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.740
going to use any geo database or something to create.

47
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.370
I'm going to use this only.

48
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.290
So username is I'm going to specify default system and remember while installing you have to use password

49
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.700
and remember that password.

50
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.160
So as you can see, my system is connected.

51
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.910
Now I can execute any commands like create table, delete, double or anything.

52
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.000
So this is all about the Oracle database installation.

53
00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:02.860
Before that for GDB, our Oracle database uses Oracle database Java database connector.

54
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.210
I'm going to use your 14,010 to the latest or something, so please use that also for database connection.

55
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.980
So that's all about everything set up with GDB for info that I'm going to tell you how we can set up

56
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.590
everything but just remember these things.

57
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.220
So once we are done with our admin page now let us move with Paris participants.

58
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.800
Log in page so I'm going to create part log in.

59
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.220
I already created part log in, which is participant log in HTML page to save the time constraint.

60
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.520
So here we are going to go to options create account.

61
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.950
If you are a new user or already a user, please log in.

62
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.400
So we are going to create the signup HTML for signup page or log in HTML for login page.

63
00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.570
So this is very simple and I'm going to create some I'm giving the links, just, I'm giving the links.

64
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.930
It's all about the frontend.

65
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.650
So let us create some signup first.

66
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.300
So what is the signup?

67
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.300
Signup page.

68
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.860
So I'm going to remove this.

69
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.130
You can do this.

70
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.180
Just comment only.

71
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.960
So this is all about header parties always.

72
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.630
Same in my case, you can change it to something another.

73
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.860
But I'm going to use only a single link for this.

74
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.920
All things like stylesheet and everything.

75
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.790
You can modify this to another, so please log in using valid name and username password you can add

76
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.690
or something like that.

77
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.600
So I'm going to change this.

78
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.680
Please sign up.

79
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.730
Not logging.

80
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.360
Please sign up.

81
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.170
As.

82
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.870
New user.

83
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.990
Nurtured.

84
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.870
So.

85
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.660
Participant This is all about log in.

86
00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.860
Page.

87
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.710
I'm going to change it to the sign up page.

88
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.930
Okay.

89
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.600
Username should be your registration number.

90
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.820
You can change this or something like that.

91
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.750
Your information.

92
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.040
I'm going to change this.

93
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.170
No need to mention this because I consider this as a university.

94
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.960
First university deleted.

95
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.990
But now I'm going to change this to all over the bar.

96
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.670
So I'm going I'm going to use form material as I told you in admin login I'm going to use your formatter

97
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.270
form method is posting action is stored.

98
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.520
Remember this is our Java servlet name which we are going to use stored in means storing the password

99
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.720
or storing the data.

100
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.910
So I'm going to specify a name here.

101
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.730
First name participant should put their name.

102
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.280
You can add a mode option, name, location, everything.

103
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.100
But I'm going to consider only four fields name, username, password and confirm password because I'm

104
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.170
going to tell you some basic part of it, not very deep part of everything.

105
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.650
So name then it should be text and name.

106
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.610
Then username takes three username password this and confirm password, then submit button and I'm going

107
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.960
to close all the text.

108
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.700
That's it out p signup so how we can see our store.

109
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:21.200
P So before I'm going to tell store P and all the methods with the database connection, I'm going to

110
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.550
tell you about more about some servlet, but how the servlet is actually work and why the server later

111
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.940
I'm going to use here for the database connection and everything.

112
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:39.160
So let us see why our database and everything is very good using the servlet.

113
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:47.740
So normally the what is the function from server and everything runs on is request and response.

114
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.910
So consider one server which uses CGI.

115
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:58.870
CGI means common gateway interface before these technologies are exist like server java.

116
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.380
Then Python also CGI is most commonly used.

117
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.730
So CGI technology enables the web server to call external programs.

118
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.300
What we are creating, these are the external programs.

119
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.380
These are stored in the server, but it's not on the network.

120
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.740
Our Java program is not on the network is on the system.

121
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.850
Basically, we are writing on the system server, which is that part.

122
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.650
And to use that part logic inside network so before.

123
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:34.440
So let's see g-technology enables web server to call external programs and pass as a HTTP request information.

124
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.180
We are going to pass as a HTTP.

125
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:43.680
It's converged just servlet or java logic to HTTP part, but to extend program process request for each

126
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.080
request you start the new process.

127
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.140
So here comes some logical or computer science part process.

128
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.290
This means past consider as our task.

129
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.470
So if you want to go to three shops.

130
00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:05.530
But every time what you are going to logic is I'm going example for a shop you want to go to shop A,

131
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:13.210
B, C, but every time what you are going to do from the starting point, go to A, then come to the

132
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:18.850
starting point, then again from the starting point, go to B, then again come to the starting point

133
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.140
to starting point.

134
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.020
Each process takes too much time, so it creates three processes.

135
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:30.730
Consider that if you want to invoke three external programs, it creates three processes each time new

136
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.480
processes.

137
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.970
This creates server load.

138
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.940
Ultimately, server is a machine, so server takes.

139
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:44.450
But much in order for creating each new process to handle that process and everything to we are assuming

140
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.160
we are writing in the higher level language, but inside the machine it's again going to use in binary

141
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.350
language or we can say machine level language.

142
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.450
So so it is very difficult to handle programs, higher level programs.

143
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:04.200
Now the disadvantages of CGI comes, as you can see, these are the this is the image of CGI.

144
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.190
This is a request from client.

145
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.970
This is our server, http server.

146
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.370
This is CGI shell.

147
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:10.980
Shell.

148
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.840
What is the CGI shell?

149
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.940
It consists the external programs.

150
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.230
Which CGI programs.

151
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.340
So this is one process here.

152
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.850
It goes to this.

153
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.670
It runs this.

154
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.690
And it will fetch.

155
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.230
This is, again, sage for the new process.

156
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.970
This again, search for the new process.

157
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.590
These are the endless loops.

158
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.640
And these are going to this request and it's giving the response.

159
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.860
So as you can see for this server, allocate some memory for this server allocates memory.

160
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.740
So process load is very high for the CGI programming.

161
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.470
So if the number of clients increases, it takes more time to sending the response ultimately over the

162
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.820
response and request.

163
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.550
Time should be less in Java servlet as the ideal conditions for each request.

164
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:58.020
It starts a process and web server is limited to start process.

165
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.520
Start processes like web server cannot create 100 or 1000 amount of times.

166
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.860
There is some restrictions on processes.

167
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:12.330
Also you can for that much servers consider a server which can create only 1000 processes.

168
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:21.090
So if the 2000 clients come and ask for request, CGI server cannot create more processes.

169
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:29.490
More than 1000 I'm considering as an example, but it uses platform dependent languages C, C++, Perl.

170
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.260
What is the difference between that?

171
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.150
Java is the platform independent.

172
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:40.590
You can use Java on any system as if you are using Linux server, Mac server, Windows Server, anything

173
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.280
you can use.

174
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:50.580
So I'm using a Windows machine if another to what we can say with another person using Mac machine or

175
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:57.840
Linux machine, it can easily use that java, but c C++ first are platform dependent ultimately.

176
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.940
So let us see about what is Java solid.

177
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.070
So Java servlet creates web container.

178
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.120
It is very new technology we can say or reason technology we have container.

179
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.620
It creates the trade.

180
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.760
So trade means basically these are some process loading commands or we can see process loading handling

181
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.450
commands.

182
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.060
So trades for handling multiple requests.

183
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:29.360
One trade can handle a 1000 requests, so it can create thousand requests, thousand response each trade.

184
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.140
So ultimately, we are increasing the number of processes.

185
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.620
So multiple requests can be come to the servlet.

186
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.290
There are many benefits over the processes such as they can share common memory area.

187
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.060
They are lightweight then processes.

188
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.020
Each process is.

189
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:52.190
So players can use common memory like trade of one trade to share shares, common memory area in a server,

190
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.290
a controller like that.

191
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.950
So these trades, what can they do?

192
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:03.870
They can easily access same memory in any time or any amount of time.

193
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.110
There are some timestamps are given.

194
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.170
Again, the cost of communication between two trades like trade of one and two also can communicate.

195
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.670
Process one and process two.

196
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.470
Communication is very difficult and there may be errors inside that.

197
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.700
So for that error reduction, again, we have to use some system methods or something like that.

198
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:28.460
But in threads we can we can easily communicate that between two threads.

199
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.900
So advantages of stability over CGI.

200
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:39.280
First is better performance always because it creates 3 to 4 requests probability because it uses Java

201
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:39.640
language.

202
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.980
Probability also increases probability.

203
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:42.790
Java language.

204
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:49.990
As you can know, there is system default or if CGI loads on your own machine, if there is error in

205
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.850
some counterpart or something like that.

206
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:58.960
If you are using common variable between two processes, see C++ Perl use the error, but probability

207
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.640
of java language of giving error is very low, so processor load is again low, robust.

208
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:09.730
JVM manages servlet, so we don't need to worry about memory leakage, garbage collections, such parts.

209
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.050
So it is very robust.

210
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.390
So JVM takes care about that servlet part and everything, so it creates a virtual machine for that.

211
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:23.950
There is no need to worry about all things garbage collection, so never trust the garbage value on

212
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.870
system or HTTP container or we can say web app.

213
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:34.170
I need to secure because you teach our language, we can see we can create public private.

214
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.060
We can use abstract, we can use interface.

215
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.070
Anything inside Java solid.

216
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.980
So these are all about the Java servlet.

217
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.900
But now you know, the I will tell you about the guest post in a letter.

218
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.500
But remember, we are going to use two methods here.

219
00:14:50.530 --> 00:15:01.360
Get and post method as you can see in in that we created a source package which is name as we created

220
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.620
as validated.

221
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.270
We are going to use do post method.

222
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:08.710
You can use do get method also here but we are posting something information.

223
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.630
So I'm going to use your do post.

224
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.100
I use your do post method.

225
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.310
So this is all about the Java servlet.

226
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.050
I told you so.

227
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:24.280
In the next further session I'm going to tell you about how we can consider this and using p sign of

228
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.290
how we can put in the database all the participants name and everything.
