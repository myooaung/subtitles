1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,440
But now we need a string here.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,630
Just remove this.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:09,890
God.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,550
Okay.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:16,190
So now we need firstly I will write and then simply explain it to you what I'm doing here.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,460
So here I will write next line and just to get here.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:32,060
And after that, I need a wide loop, which is not equal to the input, not equals.

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:33,890
Okay.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,730
So which will not equal to the one here?

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:49,180
A neat anecdote and in art equals ritual, not this.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:01,300
To so simply I will write system, not dot print, Alan.

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,190
No, it will be invalid.

13
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,520
Right.

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,890
So invalid, commander.

15
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,760
Just simply pick up the input equal.

16
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,310
Next line.

17
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,870
Okay.

18
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,200
Sure need.

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,610
Okay, so after this while loop, we need another condition, which really we have equals.

20
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:39,920
One.

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,450
We are handling this situation only because these are only loved ones.

22
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,230
So simply I will write system note here.

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:02,360
I will write system, not our friend trend and I will write.

24
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,630
You can continue on your adventure.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,550
Okay.

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,850
So next condition for us if.

27
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,140
In what it equals.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,870
Here.

29
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,590
The output will be the input of the tool.

30
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,100
Under this I will write.

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
System, not our friend Alan.

32
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,160
And for that too.

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,520
So for the two part, I will write.

34
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,310
You have successfully exited your so I can you have.

35
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,420
Successfully.

36
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,880
I thought.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,960
The game.

38
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:13,950
Okay.

39
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,700
Done simply trick.

40
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,200
Now we need some of the lines.

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,870
Okay.

42
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,700
So what I will do.

43
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:46,530
No.

44
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,640
Just add up and line here and just write.

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,040
Thanks for being the scheme.

46
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,300
So simply what we have done here.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,240
Here we got the string Collingwood and set it on equal to the in the dot in the next line.

48
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,200
That's the input of the user.

49
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,780
Then we are going to say while and we are going to set up a little wide loop here.

50
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,560
And if you remember from the loop, if the enemy entered invalid information, we have the final statement

51
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,210
here which says the invalid command.

52
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,720
So here it saved the invalid command.

53
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,710
It will reiterate back to the top and just print out options again.

54
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,290
We need to do something similar.

55
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:57,090
So here, because if we don't validate the input from the user, we are going to write back up to the

56
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,450
top.

57
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,700
So the user types in something wrong.

58
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,500
It wouldn't say invalid command.

59
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,930
So here it's straight back up to like fighting a new enemy.

60
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,500
So we need to make sure we are going to make a Y loop and we are going to basically say while the input

61
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:19,470
user providing is not equal to one or two or while the user is not inputting valid information.

62
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,390
So we are just going to keep looping and asking them what they want to do.

63
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,190
They are going to say, well, that is not equal to equals, exclamation mark, meaning not.

64
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,140
So of course, while is not equal to one, it's not equal to two.

65
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,160
Then we are going to go ahead and say systems are ordered by invalid command and then just go ahead

66
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,910
and set input equal to the next line.

67
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,700
So the validation here, we grab the input the user put in the while, which is not equal to one or

68
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,550
two and it's simply printed.

69
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,080
So we have some options down here.

70
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
First one is to continue fighting.

71
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,460
Continue fighting.

72
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,910
And the next one is the exit game.

73
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,170
So for one, we can say you can continue on your adventure here.

74
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:21,620
And the next one in this case, in the case the user defeated the enemies and how the player wants to

75
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,840
exit the dungeon.

76
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,100
So this is like the victory screen.

77
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,030
Basically, you exit the adventure game from your.

78
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:36,380
No, it's basically like you exited the jungle game from your adventure and you can add like a school

79
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,570
or just a simple system.

80
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:44,420
Okay, so if you want, again, this is fully customizable and you can play around with this.

81
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:55,670
And now being after that we have take the truth option or the user if they choose to exit, we obviously

82
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,110
need to break and just show up a little feedback.

83
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,340
You have successfully exit the case, just you have successfully exited the game.

84
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,820
So then again, I use the break.

85
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,530
It will break out of the loop.

86
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,790
And finally, just we have running just we got a message here.

87
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,240
Which will say the last one for thanks for playing this game.

88
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,780
Just like here, we have used the welcome to the jungle here.

89
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,100
Welcome to the jungle.

90
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,950
And it will simply show.

91
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,860
Thanks for playing this game.

92
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,300
Okay.

93
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,300
So now what we can do?

94
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:48,100
Firstly, we will just see the running of the whole program.

95
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,430
Okay, just simply run.

96
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,400
Okay.

97
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,400
So here, firstly, what I will do.

98
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,380
Just dive in.

99
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:12,800
See, we have the Health Potion 100 and session's HP six because a session has appeared here.

100
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,350
It is a randomized number.

101
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:23,180
So firstly, I will put it with the first attack.

102
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:33,860
So here you strike the four for damage, you receive 20 in retaliation it randomize the damage out,

103
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,240
damage taken.

104
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:45,950
And what I will do firstly I will hit just run away because I don't want to kill so I have run here

105
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,150
it show you run away from the assassin not assassin has appeared.

106
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:58,490
Firstly, I will drink a health potion first again drink health potion and now firstly I will attack

107
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,170
the Now you would try to strike the assassin for seven damage.

108
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,580
It's not doing so.

109
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,360
Just run, run now the warrior has appeared now just simply I will attack it.

110
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,540
And you could see Warrior was defeated.

111
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,930
You have one in the HP left here.

112
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,990
It has not dropped the health potion because I have said that it will be a 50% chance.

113
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,310
So let's see in the next part what it will do.

114
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,680
I will continue fighting and just simply for storing the health potion.

115
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,480
Now here it to me.

116
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,160
You have one health potion left and one for free amount of HP.

117
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,410
Okay.

118
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:45,980
Just.

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,690
I will just run.

120
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,270
Suki Waterhouse.

121
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,620
Okay.

122
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,370
See here, I have got the option.

123
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,910
You run away from the session.

124
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,280
Warrior has appeared and Warrior was defeated.

125
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,040
It's simply the randomize thing.

126
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,590
Okay, so you have 150 health potion left here.

127
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,800
When I defeated the warrior, it dropped the health potion.

128
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:20,160
You have to do health potions now because I have had it there and now again, just session has appeared

129
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,030
run.

130
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:29,340
So here I have tried this action for 22 damage and you see 29 points and I have defeated them and it

131
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,950
does not provide me the options because it's a 50% chance here.

132
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,420
So here I have done with my game.

133
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,220
Just a minute and potions dropped.

134
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,060
King, which is not coming in good way.

135
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,040
You have to hand.

136
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,230
Just a simple.

137
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,630
And just again, run.

138
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:25,270
Just again on our program here, Warrior has a rival attack on him.

139
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,210
You strike the warrior.

140
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,670
I have not just simply run because I don't want to kill you.

141
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,960
Now the zombie has appeared.

142
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,180
First, I will drink my health potion.

143
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,850
Now I will attack my zombie.

144
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,120
You strike.

145
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,140
Okay, just run.

146
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,850
Because I have not just run.

147
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,180
Now the skeleton is out there, so somebody just.

148
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,620
I will attack on him.

149
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,160
Okay, just run.

150
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,410
Skeleton has appeared.

151
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,630
Okay.

152
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,910
Here.

153
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,660
The skeleton was defeated.

154
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,690
You have 62% left.

155
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,330
The skeleton drop the health portion.

156
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,090
So now I have four health potions here.

157
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,250
So you want to continue fighting or exit the game?

158
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,910
Now, I will do exit the key.

159
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,150
So it will show you have successfully exited the game here and thanks for playing this game.

160
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,760
So this is our game here.
