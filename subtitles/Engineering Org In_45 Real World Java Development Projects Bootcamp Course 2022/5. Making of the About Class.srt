00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,140
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:12,220
So we have successfully created a file button as with options attached with it as new open, save,

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,240
print and exit.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,000
So we are done with this file part.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,150
Now we will jump to this edit button.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:28,310
So creating functions or this edit button as a menu item similar way.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,490
As we done for the files section.

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:45,560
So menu item will be like for edit we can do a cut, a copy, a paste and I think we can select.

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,910
So yes, the menu can't.

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,000
New menu item will be cut.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,080
Yes.

12
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,930
Writing it as a menu item could.

13
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,870
We can set this.

14
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,690
Method to the edit button.

15
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,800
And we can use this part again.

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,780
Space between you and your menu item.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,010
So similarly for copy.

18
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,460
Based and select all text.

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,740
So copy.

20
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,470
Based.

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,610
Select all.

22
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,110
And replacing it heralds.

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,780
Copy, paste and selector.

24
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,630
As we say.

25
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:17,890
So yes now successfully importing these menu items for Java String Library, now we have to add constructors

26
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,700
to it.

27
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,980
So adding this added dot and.

28
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,900
For the cut one.

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,180
So I had cut.

30
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,170
And.

31
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,550
Similarly for copy, paste and all.

32
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,450
Least.

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,060
Four times.

34
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,960
And then replace.

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,710
Not human cells.

36
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,730
Copy.

37
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,710
Paste.

38
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm just a little.

39
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,970
So select all.

40
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,250
Here we are.

41
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,650
So we have created actions for the edit button.

42
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,040
Now we will try to run this.

43
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:20,620
So yes, running this notepad++ run java and waiting for the program to run.

44
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,100
Checking for the edit button.

45
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:31,660
So yes, we have successfully added cut, copy, paste and select all options for the notepad.

46
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:39,010
So when we are inputting text, we can cut it, copy, paste it and select all the text.

47
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,450
Now the file is also as options.

48
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,090
Edit also has option.

49
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,660
Now we are going to add an about a space in the help section.

50
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,530
So for that we have to create a about class.

51
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,270
In Java.

52
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,550
So.

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:13,650
We have successfully created the about class now the Java String Library similarly as the notepad class.

54
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,790
So import java x dot string.

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,260
Import.

56
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:38,810
So that sticker denotes that we are importing all the components from the Java String Library.

57
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,280
Now writing the code four about constructor section.

58
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,990
So creating a constructor called about.

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,430
Opening races.

60
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:02,560
And we have set bounds for the frame size of the notepad window.

61
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:08,450
So similarly, we have to set bounds for the about section as well.

62
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,870
Let us first set a title for this about section.

63
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,510
So set title.

64
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,910
As.

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,400
About noted down application.

66
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:41,160
So the heading of this about frame is going to be about note it down application.

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,420
So it's fine now.

68
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,700
We are going to set a title.

69
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,620
We have set a title now.

70
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,320
We are going to set a bond.

71
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,870
So it's showing some errors or I think I forgot to extend this class.

72
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,220
As Jeffrey, we are going to create a frame then only we can set a title and set bounds.

73
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,270
So yes, extends.

74
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,370
Different now that Assad vanished.

75
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,200
So set bombs.

76
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,440
What do you think the bounce can be?

77
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,860
The rectangle field.

78
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,560
So.

79
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,340
Something smaller than the notepad window.

80
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,290
It could be 101 hundred.

81
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,490
500 or something like 400.

82
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,530
It's fine.

83
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:58,880
So the bouncer said, Now let us try to run this by creating our main function public static void.

84
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:14,060
Main, main function is created by string arguments and then try to run this window of about us page.

85
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:25,670
We have to set the visibility to true first then only we can run this new about.

86
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,430
About the method is invoked the constructor that we created and setting the visibility to.

87
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,800
Through.

88
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,410
Remove this.

89
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,240
And yes, so the about frame is created in a rough way.

90
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,040
Let us try to run this.

91
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,730
So perfect.

92
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,820
We have about window about noted down application with this size.

93
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:22,340
Now we will try to input something inside this and try to check this after writing the code.

94
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,020
So closing this and trying to.

95
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:35,190
You might think how you saw said default close operations set

96
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,420
so on closing.

97
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,080
On clicking the close button we exit the about window.

98
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,480
Setting this to frame this poll on close.

99
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,810
J frame.

100
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,020
This falls on close.

101
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,640
So this will dispose.

102
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,060
On close.

103
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,610
So, yes.

104
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,630
We have to set our layout as not.

105
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:32,550
Now we will similarly add or I can to the about window as the notepad part.

106
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,260
So copying this part from her image.

107
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,480
I can class and.

108
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,680
Setting this like.

109
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,730
So when we run this, we will get a similar window.

110
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,920
There's no notepad on the Java coffee icon, isn't it?

111
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:57,370
Yes.

112
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:04,160
So we have the notepad icon in the title bar and on menu mining in the taskbar.

113
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:12,740
So after adding the icon, we are going to add some text inside the about part.

114
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:23,410
So for the text part inside the window we have added this G label and inside the G label we have an

115
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,580
HTML tab which contains some text.

116
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,480
As noted down noted down version two already noted.

117
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,030
Down is a word processing.

118
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,270
It is basically a idea about what this app is doing.

119
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,470
So we have used jailable.

120
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:51,810
So we are using this VR tag as jailable takes only input as a state tax.

121
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,670
It does not suppose backslash.

122
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,790
And so we are using this HTML string from the beginning to the end.

123
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,990
You can see that.

124
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,960
So let us try to.

125
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,720
So I'm running this about window.

126
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:18,380
We get the output as this the things written inside the jailable system and are displayed here in the

127
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,710
about us window.

128
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,540
No.

129
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,030
In the notepad home page.

130
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,380
We are supposed to edit right and save text.

131
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:39,990
So that is possible only when we are going to add text field input inside the notepad window.

132
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,820
So let us figure out the function so that we can write text inside the notepad window.
