1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,810
In this video, we will have a look at the live run of this project.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,040
So we'll be running all these classes one by one and see how these classes are performing and executing

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,980
those operations for which purpose we have been created.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,800
These so let me run this first class, which is a CAD count or Java class, which will be used to count

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,450
the characters and words in the provided text area.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,040
So I'll be running this file.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,010
So here the window has been appeared.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,400
So this is the window for the cardboard count tool.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,260
So I'll be entering here.

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,380
Let's suppose I am entering this.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,350
Project contains.

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,150
Beauty ladies like.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,970
Uh, font chooser.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,500
Sorry.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,680
Font chooser.

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,460
I'll be fine.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,450
Calculator.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,240
Or online test.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,420
Puzzle.

20
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,850
And.

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,260
Take.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,280
Back to.

23
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,230
Now, let me check for.

24
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,990
Let me first change the pad color.

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:50,080
So as soon as soon as I clicking on bad color, it is showing us these color options where I can select

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,550
colors.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,600
So this will be the bad color from HSV.

28
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,870
You can choose the edge, saturation and value.

29
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,430
Also with these lines Excel or in the form of RDB.

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,660
Also you can choose and in the form of CMYK you can also choose.

31
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,760
So I will be selecting from the swatches.

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,680
So let's suppose any random color, I'll be selecting this color and I'll click on.

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,930
Okay, so the background has been changed to the color which I have selected.

34
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,090
Now let me change the color of the text.

35
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,800
So let's suppose I want to change the color of the text to something white.

36
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,540
So let me click on.

37
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,380
Okay.

38
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,680
So now this is appearing like this.

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:41,530
So the color changing has been working fine for the both background and the front of this text area.

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
Now if I click on Count.

41
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,970
If I am clicking on count.

42
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,340
So it is showing that words are 18 and characters on 113.

43
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,790
So this is how this character word count tool is working.

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,230
It is working pretty fine.

45
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,230
So this is our first class.

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
Let me close this.

47
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,480
And.

48
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,750
I'll be running now.

49
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,540
The next class, I will be closing this.

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,610
That is a font chooser class.

51
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,940
So let me click run this file.

52
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,370
So this is how the font chooser is appearing.

53
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,480
Let me check you if we can edit this.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,490
Yes, we can edit this also.

55
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,940
So let me edit this.

56
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,020
Let the things will be two lines.

57
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,510
This will be perfect to check for any.

58
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,930
Now I'll be clicking on set font.

59
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,780
So this will take us to this where this another dialog box that is a choose font.

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,340
So there is the list of the fonts and it is scrollable also.

61
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,570
So there is a list of fonts you can select from this, and here is the size you can select regular italic,

62
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,120
bold, bold italic as well.

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,460
And there is the size ten, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 68 and 64.

64
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,690
So I'll be selecting some.

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,150
Let's suppose I'll be selecting.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,840
Dubai light and bold italic let's suppose bold only and its size.

67
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,010
Let's suppose 20.

68
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:31,330
So if I click on okay so that things have been reflected, every font type family and size have been

69
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,660
reflected here in our text as well.

70
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:40,680
If I am writing something, then this is also in the same font size type and family.

71
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:50,400
So that's how this font user class is working in which we can set the font type for the text, which

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,520
we have written in our area, and we can choose font family font style and font size and.

73
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,960
And that's how it is working.

74
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,880
So let's move on the third class, which is of IP finder class.

75
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,660
So let me close this and run that IP finder class.

76
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,770
So here is our IP finder class.

77
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,930
So let me run this one.

78
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,370
So here the IP finder tool has been appeared.

79
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,630
This is the dialog box.

80
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:30,290
In this text field we have to enter our UDL so it will present you the IP of that.

81
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,210
I'll be entering a URL here.

82
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,460
So that is w w w dot google dot com.

83
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,930
That's a general url.

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,460
I'll click on find ip.

85
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,220
So it is showing that ip of w w w dot google.com is this here it is shown.

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,910
Let me click on.

87
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,910
Okay, let me check for the another one that is a Gmail dot com.

88
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,550
Gmail.com.

89
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,310
So it is showing the IP of the Gmail as well.

90
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,000
To run this project, you must have been connected to the internet.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,340
That's then it will be run.

92
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,670
Otherwise it will not show you the IP and it will show you the exception.

93
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,910
So that's how this IP finder tool is working.

94
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,670
Now let me run the another file that is my calculator or Java file.

95
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,340
So I will be running this file.

96
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,020
So here the calculator has been shown the output.

97
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,520
This is the output of the my calculator.

98
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,590
I'll be entering a value.

99
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,560
Let's suppose I have a selected eight multiplied by two, so I will click on.

100
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,660
Okay, so that is showing 16.

101
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,310
I'll click on clear.

102
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,510
So it is zero.

103
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,520
Let's check for any point values.

104
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,010
Also 2.8.

105
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:49,550
Minus one equals 21.7999.

106
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,820
So that is showing that values something, some values.

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,910
So that's the output of this minus.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,270
And let me check for divide also eight divided by two.

109
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,380
So that is four.

110
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,360
So this is the calculator, how this is working.

111
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,910
So this is the output of the calculator which we have created.

112
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,340
Now let's check for the online test java file.

113
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,570
So if I am running this online test or Java file, let's check what the output of this file.

114
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,800
Run file.

115
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,280
So here the quiz has been appeared online test of java.

116
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,980
So I am selecting random things here.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
So next.

118
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,870
Now suppose if I want to bookmark this question, I'll click on bookmark.

119
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,160
So bookmark has been added to and we have moved to the next question.

120
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,120
Let's select.

121
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,650
I am selecting random things.

122
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:48,140
Let's suppose I want to bookmark this so I will be looking at this mark or this also class next anything,

123
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,680
any options?

124
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,510
I have said I've been selected randomly.

125
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,880
And I'll be bookmarking this question as well.

126
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,480
So three bookmarks have been added this.

127
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,890
Let's suppose this.

128
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,690
And.

129
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,200
I'll click on next.

130
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,760
So what happening here is we have reached of the ten questions but we have to I if I click on result

131
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,680
so it is showing that correct answers one but we can and I click on okay so the app has been closed.

132
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,340
We can also go for the bookmark questions by clicking on those bookmark buttons because we have bookmarked

133
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,000
those questions to answer after completing all the questions.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,850
So that's how the online test class is running.

135
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,240
And let me show you the remaining two classes.

136
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,590
That is a puzzle on Java.

137
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,320
So I'll be running this puzzle dot Java file as well.

138
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,120
So one file.

139
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,340
So this is how the puzzle game will appear.

140
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,430
There is a one block back end.

141
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,040
So if I click on Phi Phi Phi will be shifted on this block.

142
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,100
This is the total click and time will be shown in seconds.

143
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,090
If I then click, then it will update the time with the respect of the time, which will be using if

144
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,820
I click on for the full value shift table.

145
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,720
So that's how this game is working.

146
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,810
We will want if is able to set these values in correct order like one, two, three and four or five,

147
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,350
six.

148
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,560
So to do that, let me try.

149
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,110
Uh.

150
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,260
This is how I can do it.

151
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,900
Now for has been come to the right place.

152
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,730
Uh.

153
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
What we need to do is.

154
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,290
So that's how you can do that.

155
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:38,800
It's.

156
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,510
Ready.

157
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,050
So you have to do that too, so that the boxes come at the right place.

158
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,620
Then it will show you that you want.

159
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,290
So that's how it is working.

160
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,010
Currently, I'm not able to arrange it, so that's how it is working.

161
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,420
Puzzle game and let's there is a last game which is a tic tac toe game.

162
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,820
Let me run it so I'll be on file.

163
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,580
So this shows us the two radio buttons either versus computer.

164
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,170
So I'll be clicking on versus computer.

165
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,310
Now my choice.

166
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,470
I'll be feeling energized.

167
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,400
I feel here so I'll feel cross the zero will appear automatically.

168
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,680
Let's I will be feeling cross here.

169
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,370
The zero paired here I'll be filling cross here zero paid here.

170
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,070
Now I can put either the here or here I will be one.

171
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,520
So it's the message shown you one click reset.

172
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,050
So I'll click reset.

173
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,670
So the game will be reset again.

174
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,170
You can play this game again.

175
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,660
So this is how the all of these classes, which we have defined and implemented in this project, are

176
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,680
working very fine.

177
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,970
The objective or purpose of this project was to.

178
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:54,090
I understand the basic concept of the AWP and the swing framework of Java.

179
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,640
So that's what we have done in this project.

180
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,080
So that's all from this.
