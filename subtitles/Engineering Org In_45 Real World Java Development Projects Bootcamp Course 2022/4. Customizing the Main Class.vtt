WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:09.100
Now so that we have covered everything up to the ad download button and the text field where the URL

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.170
is going to be like pasted.

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:19.240
And then on clicking the add download button event is going to be performed that the download is to

4
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.740
be started after that.

5
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.120
Now in the next part, we are going to set up the download table.

6
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.120
So this table is going to be set up with the help of this part of the code.

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.070
And this part is going to create a new table model with the help of the table component of string library

8
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.880
as well.

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.130
And this table is going to like select our like action listener is attached to that table also.

10
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.840
And whenever we are going to like select an event from the table, then our event is going to be changed.

11
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:04.400
Like suppose our download is started and like this, so like this, suppose this is going to be like

12
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.170
added to the row and this is like continuously changing.

13
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.600
So the action is to be listened continuously and the download is performing.

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.910
A progress bar is increasing and everything is like in motion all the time.

15
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.950
Not in this, but in this part.

16
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.180
Everything is in motion.

17
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.040
So the table is set to event values are getting changed.

18
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.700
So the argument is to list selection event.

19
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.160
So we have like this action performing at the time.

20
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.800
So that function is going to be considered for this and similarly for all of them.

21
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:51.100
Now after this, like we can select only one row at a time to play, pause, resume, or to perform

22
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.690
any other actions.

23
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.820
We cannot like pause two of the rows at the same time.

24
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:07.390
So we are going to use this single selection method of the list selection model for doing so.

25
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.110
So yes, so only one row is to be selected at a time.

26
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.380
Now we are done with the like selection part of the table introduction part.

27
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.180
Now the progress render.

28
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:28.360
So the progress bar is increasing continuously from 0 to 100 and this renderer is also saying so that

29
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.670
zero and 100 are going to be the starting and ending part of the progress render.

30
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:44.290
In the next part we have like a certain string painted through like by default the if that row is selected.

31
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.790
So the progress render is by default set to blue background.

32
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.340
You can see it here that it is showing a blue background thing.

33
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.430
So if the download is here, then it is that background is here.

34
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.320
Now if it is completed to 100%, then complete the block.

35
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.270
This progress render is converted to blue background highlight.

36
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.640
After this we are setting a height and width for the table and the progress part also so that the progress

37
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.000
bar do not exceeds the table column.

38
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.510
So in order to do so we are using like get preferred size in order to like fix that progress bar within

39
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.080
the column, not to like exceed outside the column.

40
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.350
So this is doing that now we have to set up the download panel.

41
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:50.650
So what actually the download panel is this complete thing is the download panel and this download panel

42
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.290
is going to be like contain a title.

43
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.470
So that title is containing the word downloads.

44
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.980
And inside this we are setting our layout and the size for the download label head.

45
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.710
You can see this bold download is appearing with the help of this.

46
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.250
So yes, we have started the title Border and Border Layout Center.

47
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:24.190
So this is going to be the like layout and the position of the text according to the table size.

48
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.960
So it is in the middle of the above line and below line.

49
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.040
We have above and below border for this text.

50
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.960
Now Button's panel so this buttons panel is also a very important part in this.

51
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.750
We have this button panel.

52
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.980
Once a specific row is selected, then only the button panel is going to be highlighted.

53
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.900
And also the player is disabled in the beginning.

54
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.980
Once we have like selected auto and.

55
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.610
And only then only we can clear it or otherwise.

56
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.100
If the download is done, then we can simply clear it.

57
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:17.270
But if the download is is a progress status so we cannot clear it directly, we have to first cancel

58
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.850
the download, then only we can clear it.

59
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:30.530
So looking up to this lower bottom column, this contains four buttons pause, resume, cancel and clear.

60
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.210
So what actions are attached to those buttons?

61
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.920
So we have used like all the components of the string library.

62
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.460
So in this we are also going to do so.

63
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.460
So this pause button is going to call action pause.

64
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:56.300
We are going to create functions for every button in the action event thing we are going to create later.

65
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.280
So Action Listener is going to be attached to our main class download manager.

66
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.500
Firstly, let us like understand what is happening inside this panel.

67
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.460
So initially we are like setting everything inside the panel.

68
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.040
Then only we are going to add actions.

69
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.750
So yes, this is for the pause button.

70
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.680
It is going to create action performed function with event as an argument and action is going to be

71
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.460
pause.

72
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.680
Similarly, for resume and for cancel and clear.

73
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:39.140
So everything is going to be written inside the J button component as all four of them are buttons and

74
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.070
nothing else.

75
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.430
So it's after looking at the addition of these buttons to the panel.

76
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:53.370
Now, after this, we are like setting this clear button to disable in the beginning by default.

77
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.840
So by default this set enable it set to false.

78
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.580
The argument is boolean.

79
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.360
We have set this clear button as false and button's panel and we have added a clear button to the panel.

80
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:14.120
Now similarly, we have added all the buttons to the panel and this is for like add panels to the display.

81
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.970
So we have four buttons.

82
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.800
So we are adding all the four buttons to the frame after this.

83
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.600
For the exit programme, we have created this action exit above here.

84
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.070
We have done it in the first part, I think.

85
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.540
Yes.

86
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:40.400
So this is for the closing window event we are going to perform in order to escape the application window.

87
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:48.740
So, yes, we have created this exit programme function which is going to call like system exit and

88
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.320
it is going to set it to NULL in order to escape from that application.

89
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.390
Also, we have added all the panels to the display.

90
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.000
Now after this, we have covered this exit the programme part.

91
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.550
Now to add new download, what is this?

92
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.330
So this is the addition of a unique row.

93
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:21.320
Once we paste your URL in the text field and hit that download button.

94
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:30.290
So this part is going to be responsible for adding unique rows for every download, like in order to

95
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.420
attach it to the table.

96
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.830
We are like making.

97
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:40.790
So this table so far, this part, every row is going to be added.

98
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.740
For a specific download you are then modify the order.

99
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:53.510
So this verified you are is a component of the string library as well, which verifies that whether

100
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.220
this you are is a valid one or not.

101
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.730
So by default this is set to like not null.

102
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.330
So we have to like paste to order in order to add it to the download panel.

103
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:15.710
So after this, on clicking the Add download button, a new download is going to be added to the row

104
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.060
like this.

105
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.860
So we have pasted the URL now it is not equal to null.

106
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:30.620
Then only we can click this add download and then this is added to the row and the download starts.

107
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.870
So add text field set text.

108
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:43.400
So this text field is we are adding to this action add in order to like to make things like yes, this

109
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.960
action add is we have added this add panel to the panel.

110
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:55.580
Now after this, we are attaching like action listener for that add panel which we are doing here.

111
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.210
Yes.

112
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.840
So initially the text field is empty.

113
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:07.150
The ones he paste the URL, then it is going to start the download and add it to the frame also.

114
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:14.040
So else suppose if you are all is not abandoned then what is going to happen?

115
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.120
So it is going to display that in invalid download URL error.

116
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:28.540
So suppose that you mistakenly pressed like pasted a wrong URL and then hit this add download button.

117
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:37.000
Then this is going to like short text that wait, you have pasted a wrong URL, try pasting another

118
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.810
one and then start like the new download process.

119
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:49.090
So yes, you should input that, download the URL very carefully in order to make a successful download.

120
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:58.840
So this is the new download part now for the verification of the URL like we have covered in the introduction

121
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:08.530
part that once we paste like inputted URL and our error was displayed, so that is going to be checked

122
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:17.110
here that whether the link is not broken or the link is like error free, then only the download is

123
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.070
to restarted.

124
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:30.380
So it is going to check whether the link is starting with http and then all the text like information

125
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.370
bits that you are is in lowercase.

126
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.200
And also we can like start links with as http.

127
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:48.040
And actually both are the protocols, valid protocols, just this as the notes are secured and this

128
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.150
without s is simply hypertext transfer protocol.

129
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:59.170
So yes, we are like verified that the U.S. is valid, valid or not.

130
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:07.600
Now format of the URL is going to be checked here using a try and catch exception handling method.

131
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:15.760
You are l is not null then verify the URL is to be added with the new URL and the argument also says

132
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:25.870
so as if like that is any exception they are is not valid, then things is going to be like stop and

133
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.520
it is going to be return null.

134
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.730
So make sure that you are real.

135
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.380
Specify the fine.

136
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:42.070
So like your URL should contain a file like we have can paste any random link which is not containing

137
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:42.760
anything.

138
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:49.510
So we have to like check that whether this link has a file attached to it or not.

139
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:57.460
So yes, this is going to check not whether the URL is verified in all the ways or not.

140
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:06.520
Like verifying the download URL format of the URL and specify the file whether the URL, specify the

141
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.420
file or not.

142
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.860
And then after all this, we are going to return the verified URL.

143
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:18.760
So this is the total process of verifying the URL that whether it is valid or not.

144
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:27.610
Now after this, if suppose everything is verified or the download has started successfully, now after

145
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:34.930
this, suppose if we select a specific URL or specific row is selected in order to perform any tasks.

146
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:44.740
So this part is for that we have to like check that whether the selection is that we made is not null,

147
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:50.320
then only we can perform the tasks so if not clearing.

148
00:13:50.320 --> 00:14:01.390
So this if statement signifies that we have to add a clearing like suppose this download is not cleared,

149
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.190
it is already present.

150
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:11.410
Then only we can add like receive notifications from it, like whether it is downloading, whether there

151
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.190
is an error or the download has completed.

152
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:21.250
So these are the specific notifications we are supposed to receive now.

153
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:26.680
Pause, resume, cancel and clear functionalities are added here.

154
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:34.390
We have created a pause function similarly for the resume and for cancel and clearing.

155
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:42.670
So these three are like working in a similar way, but the difference arrives here in the clear button.

156
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.020
In the by default the clearing was set to false above.

157
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:54.160
We have discussed it, so for clearing we have to set the boolean clearing object to true.

158
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.740
Then we have to like enable the clear button once the cancer like.

159
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.270
Once the download is selected and it is canceled, then only this buttons becomes enabled.

160
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:12.900
And yes, so we are going to like set a clear specific selection.

161
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:18.060
A specific selected row is only going to be cleared, not all the rows.

162
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.790
So yes, we can clear one row at a time, not multiple rows at a time.

163
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:32.280
So once the selected row is cleared, then again the clearing boolean object is set to false and everything

164
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.960
is like back to normal.

165
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.750
Selected download is again set to null.

166
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.460
Now in order to clear something else, we have to again select a download.

167
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:48.600
Then this null will set to like a specific order and then we can perform all the actions, pause the

168
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.540
resume, clear and cancel everything.
