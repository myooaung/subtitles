1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:10,770
We already started our project, which is based on Java BLOCK System, which I refer to name as Connect

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,620
to Globe because I'm connecting the people to the software.

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,000
Or we can see server deployment through JSP and Java servlet.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:29,330
So if you have seen we already created this, not this page we created indexed JSP page and I already

5
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,160
coded some part.

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,720
I will tell you what is the significance of this part?

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,110
So this is the index page, which is basically first loading page or landing with web page.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,230
You can see now, what is these things?

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,500
I will tell you later, but this is very important.

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,170
I'm preferring my page language java, not HTML.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,120
So I'm embedding embedding the Java code in HTML you can say throughout the JSP.

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,040
So this is the beautiful thing of JSP and ignore this.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,290
These are all the JavaScript where I preferred some CSS files.

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,410
So if you have seen these things, let me show you.

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,990
These are the JSP, which I'm going to create.

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,950
But if I'm going to downward a little bit and I will tell you, I'm using JSP here.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,590
So all these things are basically just be JSP language or we can save this language.

18
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,580
Okay, now you are seeing this not logging message.

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,260
Everything all dot println.

20
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,170
It's basically not HTML.

21
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,740
It's.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,920
So I am embedding inside these.

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,490
These are the things very important showing in the green.

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,830
So the Green Party is Java.

25
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,960
So I'm using JSP now.

26
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,870
I am using JSP instead of using HTML.

27
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,260
You say.

28
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,430
HTML is very useful.

29
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,320
You can use this in HTML only.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,070
But the thing is, while printing this message you can see this.

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,720
I just want to create, not log in message or something like that in this.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,540
What I have to do, I have to create one HTML, then I have to create one servlet.

33
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,940
For that servlet I need backend each and everything.

34
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:18,960
Now I can create one JSP file and inside that only I can use Java file and it will load directly.

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,050
So that's a beautiful thing because I don't want to create index HTML and that index servlet also.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,270
So I embedded this.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,270
I will tell you what is the JSP thing here?

38
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:39,300
Then I created an admin page admin JSP, which is pretty similar, which is loading pretty similar.

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,220
But one thing is here is.

40
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,250
Just ignore this.

41
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,080
I just added This is nothing but just sentence.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,760
If you know the java or HTML basics, I'm just writing this part because I don't want to add some imaginary

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,000
part.

44
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,380
Am writing just this part.

45
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,270
And these are some images I'm downloaded from the internet and.

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,600
Here.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,410
You can put some things then all the things you can put here.

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,630
So important thing.

49
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,130
Here is this form.

50
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,170
Well, then what is the form?

51
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,810
Basically, add a log in admin, log in process.

52
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,490
Just create action.

53
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,270
It will ask for username and password name as username and password to log in.

54
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,510
Everything here is very important and I'm including footer html to add that footer and which is the

55
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,260
food html.

56
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,970
This is the html.

57
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,930
Basically nothing.

58
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,760
But it's having some links images then something here like that.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,400
So this is we all already created.

60
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,240
I just added admin jsp with this.

61
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:51,020
If you want to create another thing here like just only form, you can add this to give minimalistic.

62
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,110
Look, I'm just adding all the text here and I'm just copied that part only so you can add that part.

63
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,900
So let us see what the JSP is.

64
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,710
So our.

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,200
So let let me go to the soil first.

66
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,030
If I told you that.

67
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,560
Solid.

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,480
What is a solid?

69
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,520
It's a pure Java code.

70
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:20,390
You can add a HTML inside that, but it's request server and response time each embedded with this.

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,660
But what if I can use only HTML?

72
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:30,320
I can put that java file on the network instead of being on the server instead of giving load on the

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,260
server because server is also searching that file for that particular purpose.

74
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,050
Instead of that, I can put Java file in the network layer, which is basically network is also having

75
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,070
some storage capacity we can say, or we can transfer capacity.

76
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,260
So I can embedded that part in HTML only.

77
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,280
So this is the forward method, include method each and every thing, then servlet, important parts.

78
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,090
I'm going to tell you if you know the servlet, there are three important parts.

79
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:09,920
Here is HTML, CSS JS for frontend java servlet program for backend or logic we can say and web XML

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,840
to control flow of web app each animating one instead of this.

81
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,190
JSP is a Java servlet pages basically Java language inside extreme page, so you don't need to worry

82
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,570
about web dot xml.

83
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,040
My file is added or not.

84
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,960
No need to worry about that.

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,200
It will take care itself with that syntax.

86
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,080
Or we can say scripting syntax for that purpose.

87
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,030
Tooling between java and HTML.

88
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,620
But you can cannot use JSP directly for the database connection.

89
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,130
Remember that you need to create java separate java file for for that like listener files or everything.

90
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,660
So that's another thing.

91
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,510
But I don't just for fetching part, just for displaying part, I can use JSP.

92
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,340
So JSP technology is used to create web application, just like servlet technology.

93
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,820
It can be thought of extension of solid because it provides more functionality than servlet like expression

94
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,480
language.

95
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:14,600
Still Java scripting language is everything raw transcript language also provides so JSP page contains

96
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,490
a statement text plus JSP text.

97
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:23,600
As I shown you before that part, then JSP pages are easier to maintain because of servers.

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,730
Because we can separate designing development if you know, like let me show you.

99
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,490
This admin got GST.

100
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,760
There is more padding here because it's shifted to this part.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,640
Notice let me use this part on you.

102
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,060
So it's very big file, as you can see.

103
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,250
So as you can see in this part, you can see this.

104
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,420
All the things are basically design.

105
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,250
And these all the things are basic part of our development.

106
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:03,140
So GSP is easier to maintain, or we can say easier to specify the gap between designing and development.

107
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,800
If I am using HTML and servlet, what is the difference?

108
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,660
I have to create one another file which is going to slow down the server and which is going to load

109
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,830
so it takes more time and everything.

110
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,710
Maintenance is very difficult.

111
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,840
In that case, it provides additional features with some expression languages, custom tags.

112
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,560
You can create some custom tags in cases or JavaScript.

113
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,690
You can use that directly in JSP.

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,700
So that's a very huge thing.

115
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,960
A lot of things you can do.

116
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,280
But what is the advantage is basically I'm going to tell you it's an extension to servlet.

117
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:43,270
If you notice that we have some limitations like for the gate forward method each and everything, you

118
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,600
have to remember everything, syntax each and everything.

119
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,380
But here there is not that such case.

120
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,830
You can provide as many as four word cases, everything.

121
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,530
And it's an extension of servlet because why I'm doing extension, you can use some implicit objects,

122
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,300
predefined tags, custom tags, you can create expression, language, you can create, you can create

123
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,300
another methods in JSP also just like Java.

124
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,570
But you have to remember, you have to give the syntax.

125
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,350
What is the JSP image?

126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,650
It's entirely just that triangular arrows with percent and you have to end that JSP.

127
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:26,390
Do you recall that HTML having some JSP tags then easy to maintain as I told you is very easy to maintain.

128
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:33,380
We mix our business logic with presentation logic in servlet like logic is basically development and

129
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,700
presentation is basically design.

130
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,280
We have to mix both like for the center part each and everything you have to put out and everything.

131
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:41,610
Oh.

132
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,810
Then fast development.

133
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,330
No need to recompile and redeploy.

134
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,270
I will tell you what is the team here?

135
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,680
Why solid?

136
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,580
If you create a new servlet, you have to redeploy it again.

137
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,850
You have to run it again.

138
00:08:51,970 --> 00:09:00,010
But in JSP consider you develop the one code in JSP or you can say you develop one AB, which is related

139
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,570
to your car booking.

140
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,410
Car booking app.

141
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,720
You create it in JSP fully.

142
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:13,510
And after developing in that part and deploying on the server, I'm not telling on this local server,

143
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,630
I'm telling one online server after two or three weeks, you understood as a developer you have some

144
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,660
mistakes in that you need to add one more GSP.

145
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,210
You can add that JSP in that server part or we can set deployment, but just add it.

146
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,700
You don't need to redeploy.

147
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,660
No need to change your dot.com part or your L part.

148
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,740
It just added and it just automatically redeployed.

149
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,370
So no need to recompile once.

150
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,240
It is very.

151
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,250
What we can say.

152
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,140
There is no errors in that DSP.

153
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:51,600
You can redeploy it again and again as many as we want because it's automatically redeployed in JVM

154
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,660
or Java server.

155
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:00,550
Similarly, if JSP pages is modified, we don't need to compile redeploy, so let course need to update

156
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,840
it.

157
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,930
Recompiled.

158
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,910
Sometimes what happens while fetching the database if we have no entries there, that thing is also

159
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,720
showing the null.

160
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:14,290
So it's if we have change, look and feel the application and everything, we have to redeploy it again

161
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,680
and again.

162
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,520
So that means we need to stop the server, we need to redeploy it, then again bring back server like

163
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:28,390
so instead of this, what we can do, we can just add the JSP inside that and we can perform such actions.

164
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,720
So let us see in the ID what I've created already.

165
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,720
So this is admin and if you have seen I put a log in JSP, so let me log in process.

166
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,000
JSP So this is very simple file.

167
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,610
What I'm putting the admin netbeans is my password.

168
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,710
You can choose any different because I am specifying this only I don't want to specify or.

169
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,690
Molting year, and this is importing this part and all the things it's displaying.

170
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,630
So this is all about how I'm creating this.

171
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:14,400
But let me tell you what is the basic theme here is if you have seen this part already, I'm specifying

172
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,880
the A status DSP.

173
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,390
So I will tell you later what is the significance of this status?

174
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,070
Everything.

175
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,630
But always remember one thing while developing this.

176
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,540
You don't need to recompile it again.

177
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,730
As these are the JSP files you don't need to recompile.

178
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,510
So what you are going to do is just here, just add that file in your project in JSP.

179
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,470
As I told you earlier, how we can add these files in your JSP.

180
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,010
Similarly, you need to add that file in GSP.

181
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,100
Just recompile it and you are good to go to develop your files and each and everything here.

182
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,920
So this is all about how we are going with this.

183
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:10,960
So in further videos, what I'm going to tell you, I'm going to create some files here and I'm going

184
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:18,310
to build it throughout my project with some default things I'm mentioning here.

185
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,730
Some files you need to create here.

186
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,170
But.

187
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,520
Always remember, create all files.

188
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,770
Don't miss any footer, file or anything.

189
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,830
So this is the status and I'm using a skill.

190
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,300
I will tell you what is the significance of this?

191
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,990
Why I am putting the SQL file and each and every thing log out.

192
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,330
JSP I'm going to create.

193
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm putting everything here.

194
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,990
So I will tell you what is the significance of this each and everything in later part.

195
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,420
So this is it we can create.

196
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,630
So let us create one more GSP, which I already created.

197
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,630
It's just see what you can say showing the file.

198
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,820
It's not very useful file because there is no logic inside this.

199
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,980
But let me show you what is the file name?

200
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,290
So specify the file name is Apia.

201
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,060
You can finish.

202
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,800
So it will take time to create JSP file.

203
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,660
Once it is loaded.

204
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,010
You can see this file is no use of this.

205
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,800
If you want those fish, I'm cooking this as it is because I want this fish that I'm going to need at

206
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,160
this point.

207
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,820
So let me tell you what I'm going to do this year.

208
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,780
So my thing is very simple here.

209
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,580
Usage is very simple.

210
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,150
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create one.

211
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:55,350
I'm going to use one HTTP protocol here, which is basically nothing but some.

212
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,090
More what we can say package here.

213
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,620
Some templates which I'm going to use.

214
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:10,540
So it's nothing but just creating the objects, everything I'm going to create and some I'm going to

215
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,280
edit some locations.

216
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,660
So if you want to add more locations, you can add.

217
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,230
But I just added only two.

218
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:21,940
Three locations

219
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,420
you're only.

220
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,850
These are the locations I added and which I found on internet easily.

221
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,780
These are some random locations I added, and I just want to put this.

222
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,750
So if you want to add, you can add it here more using or creating by objects.

223
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,550
So these are the property and these are all the JavaScript things.

224
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,120
So that's it about JSP, which I created.

225
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,120
You can directly copy this part or if you want, you can develop this part.

226
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,740
Part is very easy here, but I'm adding some functions here, as you can see here.

227
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,910
So this is how you can develop this part.

228
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,500
Function, functions, family, all these things are related to script JavaScript.

229
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,450
So if you want to add in Java, you have to mention that it's in text, but I just added in JavaScript

230
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,740
part for the frontend.

231
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,160
So this is how we can create the this part.

232
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,630
I hope you understand.

233
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:30,200
In the further part, I'm going to explain the main logic of SQL part here with the database connection.

234
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,350
And this is it about this topic.
