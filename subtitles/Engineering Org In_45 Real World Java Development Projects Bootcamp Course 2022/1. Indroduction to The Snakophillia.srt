00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,610
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:10,790
So in this series of learning making projects in Java today, we are going to make a new project in

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,900
core Java.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:19,050
So on your screens you are seeing a layout of this application.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,800
Basically, this is the interface of the application we are going to meet.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,840
So this application is headed as the snake.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,060
Ofelia Feed the snake.

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,390
So I hope by listening to the title you must have.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,310
Yes.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,340
Must have built a rough insight about what we are going to make today.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,100
So this is basically a game made in Java code.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,930
In this game we have to feed the snake and make it grow longer and longer.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,410
The game continues until you feed the snake without hitting any obstacle.

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,800
So let me give a quick introduction about the application we are going to make today.

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,710
So in this we have a player.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,880
Suppose the user is the player and going to play this game in his or her text.

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,680
So the player is going to control a dot, a square or any object like in this we have an apple.

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,770
Yes, this is the apple from which we are going to feed thusly.

19
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:44,910
So this object is inside this border plane and we have to feed this three dotted snake with this.

20
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,730
Now, then the snake will move forward.

21
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,450
And if this object, which is an apple, it will leave a trail behind.

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:03,590
Like if the snake will eat this apple, a more dot will be added to the body of snake, and later this

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,390
object will shift to any other place in the frame.

24
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:18,770
So we are going to build this main window and once the snake hits, any obstacle like the wall is an

25
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,760
obstacle.

26
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,180
The snake itself is an obstacle here.

27
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:32,030
So when the snake hits this, this, this or this four side window or itself, then the pop up will

28
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,760
appear saying that the game is over.

29
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,470
In another common scheme, a snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail, a fixed number

30
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,390
of units away from head.

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,620
Like suppose there are three units.

32
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,480
And the last part is the tail.

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:59,930
So after eating this apple, the snake will grow a tail behind its head and it will continue until the

34
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,780
game is continued and not over.

35
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,330
The player loses and the game is over.

36
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,680
So this pop up will appear when the obstacle is hidden and the game is finished.

37
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,040
So I hope you understood this game.

38
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,820
If you are nineties kid, you must have played this game in your keypad phones.

39
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:30,650
And by making this game will make you nostalgic about playing this game in your head in your childhood.

40
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:37,910
So let's get a quick idea about what are the specifications of this project.

41
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,680
We are going to make today.

42
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:48,230
So talking about the specifications of the project, as I already told you, there will be a player

43
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,190
which will control the dot with the help of his or her keyboard.

44
00:03:53,210 --> 00:04:01,910
So your keyboard has four navigation buttons up, arrow down, arrow, left arrow and right down.

45
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,700
So the player will control the snake with the help of these four buttons only.

46
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:15,980
So that dot square object where suppose that we have an apple here is inside the border plain and we

47
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:23,570
have to make the snake with the help of our keyboard to eat that apple object inside the frame.

48
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:30,560
So as the snake moves forward, it leaves a trail behind resembling a moving snake.

49
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:38,330
Basically, there are images which the snake this consist of, but it will look like there is a moving

50
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,450
snake and eating the apple and going.

51
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:50,390
But no, we are just adding images after the tail and again and again until the game is not over, the

52
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:56,000
player loses when the snake runs into the screen border obstacle or itself.

53
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,180
So if the snake hits the screen border.

54
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,950
And if like.

55
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,820
Suppose.

56
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,150
The snakeheads, this border, screen border or itself.

57
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,030
Then the game gamble over.

58
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:16,950
So everybody is of hope, willing to make this project on their own.

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,650
So before starting to make how this project is, let us gain a quick idea about what are the concepts

60
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,160
we are going to learn by making this application.

61
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,280
So what will you learn?

62
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,950
Heading off this slide.

63
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:43,890
So before making any project, we must wonder what we are going to learn by making this project.

64
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:51,990
What are the concepts that I will gain in my mind after making the project which I am going to start?

65
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,050
So you are no wrong.

66
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:01,130
We must think that what actually is this project actually going to help me to?

67
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:09,340
Not share my knowledge in Java or any other language in which a project is going to be made.

68
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,760
So let us start the concepts which we are going to learn in the project.

69
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,340
So the first point is object oriented programming in Java.

70
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,390
So what is object oriented programming in Java?

71
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:35,420
So basically OPS in Java organizes a program around the various objects and well-defined interfaces.

72
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:43,240
And these concepts aim to implement some real world entities in the program.

73
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,510
Ahead of having object oriented programming in real entities.

74
00:06:51,510 --> 00:07:00,150
There are also many features of OBS in Java we are going to use in this project like inheritance, hiding,

75
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:06,630
polymorphism and etc. in the programming section which you will see later.

76
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:14,230
Apart from object oriented programming, what are the other factors we are going to learn by making

77
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,100
this project?

78
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:24,010
So after the completion of this project, you will be able to make an amazing application using just

79
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:30,790
core Java libraries, not any complex libraries, but just simply core Java libraries.

80
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:41,450
Thus make Ofelia feel the snake game is built using core Java AWP and string libraries and packages,

81
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,850
so the app is built above AWP and swing only.

82
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,560
Let us take a quick look at what AWP and Swing are.

83
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:59,340
AWP and Swing are used to develop window based applications in Java.

84
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:07,800
AWP is an abstract window toolkit that provides various component classes like label, button text,

85
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,760
etc. to show window components on the screen.

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,800
All the classes are the part of Java dot AWP package, which we will see in the programming section

87
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,460
later.

88
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,040
On the other hand, Swing is the part of Java foundational classes that is built on the top of AWP and

89
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,870
written entirely in Java.

90
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,950
Like suppose there is interference of any other language, then we have to learn that part also.

91
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,230
But no, that's not the thing.

92
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:48,090
The project is just made in Java and the library which we are going to use, are also made in Java only.

93
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,400
So my talking about the birth of learning how to make this project.

94
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,720
There is a main feature which I am going to tell you about now.

95
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:07,580
So we are going to make this game from scratch, like we have to write the code, make the project from

96
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:16,520
the beginning in our compilers, and write each function component classes, methods one by one with

97
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:22,390
explaining what this part is doing and what that part is doing and everything.

98
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:30,080
We are not going to leave a single point while making this project, and this is the main part of learning

99
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,280
this project.

100
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,250
So building such an interesting game of your own from scratch.

101
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,890
Yes.

102
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,390
You are hurting me, right?

103
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,020
This interesting game we are going to make from scratch.

104
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:50,510
Also, the classes and objects are the main part of object oriented programming in Java where there

105
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,260
is oops, there is nothing without classes and object.

106
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:02,720
So yes, apart from all the things, the classes and objects are also being used while making this project.

107
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,880
So I hope you all are excited to start making this project with your own.

108
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:20,960
So come on, let's switch into the coding section and start the coding part and learn how to make function

109
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,400
components, classes, libraries and package with our own.

110
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,410
See you in the next part.
