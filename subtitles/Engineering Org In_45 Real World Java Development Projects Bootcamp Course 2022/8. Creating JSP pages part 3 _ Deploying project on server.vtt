WEBVTT
1
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:11.270
We already created some JSP files as admin updates, student update questions and everything, but we

2
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.240
need to create some more JSP files for everything.

3
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.340
So Update Student contains some just feel like JSP files as adequate with a regression.

4
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.040
JSP So let us see how we can create that part.

5
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.530
Also this part also had a question.

6
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.280
Just be here.

7
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.180
Okay.

8
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.320
So let us see.

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.370
Student list first.

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.930
Which contain.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.180
Student speak.

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.710
I will copy this for naming purposes only click new JSP.

13
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.750
Then I'm mentioning the GSP file here.

14
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.250
It.

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.110
Before things I already told you about.

16
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.880
There are some default things.

17
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.130
So let me remove this part and let me remove this part also.

18
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.960
One nine.

19
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.210
So it contents.

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.950
First add a student GSP.

21
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.070
So let me create one ad student GSP here.

22
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.750
So this is very important.

23
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.160
JSP As you can see.

24
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.580
STUDENT Because it contains all things related.

25
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.500
Adding the student.

26
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.540
Using GSP.

27
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.610
Okay.

28
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.360
So what it contains.

29
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.040
Let's see.

30
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.090
So I'm using the Java as my language.

31
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.310
Or let me change this and.

32
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.030
Hard.

33
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.680
Students.

34
00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:01.240
Okay so this contains this and I enter student details with sponsor's permission is basically this controller

35
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.260
student insert.

36
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.390
So as you can see in the office controller I created student insert method.

37
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.420
So it is the front end of the student insert.

38
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.500
But you can see so this is the front end of that student insert.

39
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.560
If that message to like student is inserted or something, data is not inserted.

40
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.540
I'm printing this message here with this get parameter and output print.

41
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.120
See?

42
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.370
So I already told you I already mentioned the messages here.

43
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.360
Message one is student added message to student is not ready.

44
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.590
So I'm printing this.

45
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.610
We did not edit one edit for this is the frontend for the similar thing.

46
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.250
I'm going to create an instruction method.

47
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.420
Or at instruction GSP.

48
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.830
Again, similar thing.

49
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.920
New Jersey.

50
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.960
So as you can see, we can we are using JSP more than this.

51
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.740
Java, but it's Java only because we are writing Java files inside JSP.

52
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.060
But you can see it's html.

53
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.900
So we are using HTML embedded with java.

54
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.060
So add instruction.

55
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.070
Again, we started with an instruction.

56
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.730
And it's.

57
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.940
Shows.

58
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.570
With instruction insert.

59
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.170
GSP.

60
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.510
And this adding this instruction with text.

61
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.030
You can add instruction here.

62
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.540
Which is open to the instruction list only if submitted for that purpose.

63
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.210
Instruction in that instruction for that.

64
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.590
Or again, I need to create an instruction.

65
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.490
Just be also.

66
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.060
So these all things are similar.

67
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.750
Let me go with this other question.

68
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.470
Just be.

69
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.040
This are adding the question.

70
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.000
So we are done with adding pot, adding GSP pot.

71
00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:03.380
So some things are remaining which contains basically exempt GSP result GSP for the replying the result

72
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.770
and some demo GSP for that purpose.

73
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.660
So let me create one exam GSP for examination fronted.

74
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.130
You speak?

75
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.950
It's him.

76
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.480
In.

77
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.350
Okay.

78
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.290
It is deployed.

79
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.110
We are done with our project now, so let us deploy this for the deploying purpose and deploy it and

80
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.740
try it already.

81
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.080
So let me redeploy it again.

82
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.490
What I'm going to do is I'm going to click Clean and build first.

83
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.570
So we close this part.

84
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:06.400
So before this, you should always check all the libraries like DC 14 for the database connection.

85
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:13.170
Sometimes I also made mistake because I never added some files, so it will throw the null pointer exception

86
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.460
error.

87
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.290
So now our will be successful.

88
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.330
Now running our path.

89
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.550
So as.

90
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.440
You can see.

91
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.090
Glass with silver is now deployed with these holdings in milliseconds.

92
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.880
So let us go to the Chrome browser.

93
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.360
And you can see this part is done already.

94
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.060
Now, first, let us go to the login part.

95
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.010
And if I am using route or something here, it will print me the error, basically invalid username

96
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.580
and password.

97
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:54.040
So for this I know the password, this admin admin.

98
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.320
So this is now our admin panel.

99
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.580
Let me add one student, add or update.

100
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.980
You can go to the back panel and you can check.

101
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.490
Always.

102
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.350
Let me add a student here.

103
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.190
First, let me add name as John.

104
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.740
User IDs j101 password is mentioning simple.

105
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.150
One, two, three, four.

106
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.690
Digital student added, Let me go to the home.

107
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.660
You can add our updated instruction.

108
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.780
Now you can see there is no instruction here.

109
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.440
Let me add one instruction here.

110
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.390
Always be ethical.

111
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.060
Then I want to add one more.

112
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.610
Unser.

113
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.970
All questions.

114
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.150
That isn't.

115
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.520
Now, if I go to add an object student again, you can see this is done.

116
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.180
You can go to object student or you can delete that student also.

117
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.140
And remember, this is starting from zero.

118
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.360
So you can implement it already, but you have to check that all the code.

119
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.460
Now you can see you can always be.

120
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.650
Answer all questions here.

121
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:12.780
I don't object.

122
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.180
Student Let me add a question here.

123
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.010
First question is.

124
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.120
Java is.

125
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.450
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

126
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.160
Higher level language.

127
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.220
I can add some simple question GSP means.

128
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.740
Let me add Java solid pages.

129
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.720
Just two options, basically.

130
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.070
Java server pages.

131
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.040
Wrong option.

132
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.700
Jake Whitty.

133
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.130
Equity is wages.

134
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.180
The ocean is.

135
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.840
One correct option is we know now, if you would, done.

136
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.830
Why this year in question is not added.

137
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.970
Okay.

138
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:23.280
So as you can see, we have to mention something here always.

139
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:24.950
Okay.

140
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.370
So let me add this part again.

141
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.010
If you go to this and connection is successful, is done.

142
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.010
You can see.

143
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.120
There are too many values inside a school exception.

144
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.650
So I'm getting a school exception.

145
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.670
Let us check that.

146
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.150
First.

147
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.880
What is escalation?

148
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.730
I'm getting serious.

149
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.960
Christians be.

150
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.330
Getting this deal.

151
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.640
Sculpture exhibition at 31 and.

152
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:14.800
Deacon.

153
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.200
Okay.

154
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.780
Okay, let me.

155
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.870
You knew this because.

156
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.250
Some of the mistake.

157
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.520
Deploying the quisling.

158
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.210
None.

159
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.010
So now we are done with this part.

160
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.240
So.

161
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.560
Let me check first.

162
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.340
Why?

163
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.200
She's doing 31 and we'll keep it.

164
00:10:59.070 --> 00:10:59.510
Okay.

165
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.400
So it is showing me you are providing some more values less than this because.

166
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.210
Seven.

167
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.230
And what we have in question table is only.

168
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.820
Six questions.

169
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.320
So.

170
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.760
We are adding some more extra things.

171
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.450
Questions and food options with correct option because.

172
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.730
Okay.

173
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.970
So let me do this first.

174
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.250
Let me check.

175
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.760
And what is 48?

176
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.370
Let me run this again.

177
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.860
So you may find some errors here also.

178
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.600
Now you can see Christian in Israel.

179
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:06.690
If you go to the homepage and if you can add an update question, you can see correct answer edition

180
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.000
and going back to the panel.

181
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.780
You can create a single sphere, so.

182
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.170
j10191234 is our password for the student and we going to log out page again.

183
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.340
And then to exit.

184
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.580
So once you exit, I'm going to student page now.

185
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.420
Basically student log in method.

186
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.260
Know what you already know.

187
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.650
j101 password is one, two, three, four.

188
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.740
Let me know in this.

189
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.220
So book a student instruction GSP.

190
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.390
He's not done.

191
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.380
We are remaining with student instruction.

192
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.880
JSP Let me create this as fast as possible.

193
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.030
Student instruction.

194
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.800
JSP We are remaining with one.

195
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.030
JSP As I told you.

196
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.800
Student JSP Instruction.

197
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.710
JSP Because it should show the first student instruction JSP.

198
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.790
Let me check.

199
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.400
It's done.

200
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.700
Those.

201
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.100
Okay.

202
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.350
I will click finish.

203
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.850
I told you like there are some errors while deploying this.

204
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.870
Remember, you have to check each and everything before deploying.

205
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.300
So as I told you, I'm demeaning with this.

206
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.880
First, let me just create this.

207
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.870
This is really simple GSP.

208
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.950
And just check again.

209
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.170
One, two, three, four.

210
00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.980
Log in.

211
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.650
Or it is not deployed.

212
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.190
Okay.

213
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:07.710
As I just created.

214
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.020
Let me redeploy it again our server.

215
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:18.290
So sometimes it takes time to deploy it.

216
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.380
All things will go fast in this.

217
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.620
So let me go to the student login page.

218
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:29.400
Do you have?

219
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.410
101.

220
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.590
One, two, three, four is our bass and logging.

221
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.700
Student instructions.

222
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:43.960
Okay.

223
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.530
The thing is that I made some errors.

224
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.440
Let me remove this first.

225
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.520
Yes.

226
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:58.370
Why I made some errors is a file name is this.

227
00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.790
Let me copy this because I want include this file inside this.

228
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.970
Then.

229
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.890
Let me do this, New Jersey.

230
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.270
This.

231
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.790
Let me remove this part.

232
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.960
So as I told you, you have to always remember to read all files you mentioned.

233
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.540
And let me redeploy my server.

234
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.080
I will click this.

235
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:35.770
Reload.

236
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.480
Now you can see.

237
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.130
Welcome, John.

238
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.590
Always with our instructions.

239
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.630
If I could start a test here.

240
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.740
You can change or you can see your options also.

241
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.020
And 5450.

242
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.140
Now if I put Java solid pages.

243
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:55.730
Submit.

244
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.710
Open questions is totally wrong.

245
00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.740
Correct answers.

246
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.290
John Usually our result is printing.

247
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.850
So this is all about how we created our pages and student loan.

248
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.530
So this is very simple.

249
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.240
If I go to again.

250
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.500
And if I'm bleeding.

251
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.580
One, two, three, four.

252
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.040
Start this, I'm going to create and starting this query again.

253
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:27.810
If I put his query pages and wrong answer, this correct answer is zero and it's printing the all things.

254
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.610
So this is a very simple thing.

255
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.350
You can add more and more questions here, but as I told you.
