1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,110
So in this video, we will be talking about the next three classes, which is book intensity gap, fill

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,570
the Gap and will enter the gap.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,770
So the first class is about inter-city cab.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,100
It is defined inside the package cab booking system.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,050
We are imported the necessary packages.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,130
After that, we have defined the class intensity gap, which is extending the frame.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,280
Inside, which we have a table type of instance named as table.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,490
Then there is a J label instance, three G label instances, and there is a buttons, three buttons

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,450
and two choices.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,080
After that, we have inside the main section, we have defined the called our class with the null values

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,340
and then we have defined our parameter constructor book intensity gap with the string username, set

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,360
the title as book gap.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,040
And after that we have to get content paints at the background color as white and set the default close

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,690
operation or for that window.

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,040
Then there is a label for both Intercity Cat for which you have set the as blue and set the font family

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,310
and type for that label and edit, set the size and location for that label and edit that or frame after

17
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,460
that.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,290
Set the layout as null.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,050
And inside the source label we have restoring the source and setting font family size for that and adding

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,750
the location and size of that label.

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,170
And after that, we have added that source label to our.

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,550
Frame.

23
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:28,550
After that, there is a destination label we have defined for the destination, setting its font bound

24
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,700
and adding that to our frame.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,200
After that, there is a choice instance we have setting a location size and adding that to our frame.

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,610
Similarly, for the C2 choice.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,480
Then there is a label for the name setting its font, its size, location, adding the doorframe.

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,060
Similarly, there is a label setting as font size and adding that to a frame.

29
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,440
Then there is a label for the user name, setting its font size and adding that frame.

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,950
Then there's a label setting its font size and adding that also over frame.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,450
Then inside the tree block what we are doing, creating a connection, executing the query.

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,850
Select a string source and destination from the intensity table and we are adding all those sources

33
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,120
and destination into our of choices.

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,620
Then we will be executing query select extract from account where username event will match and we will

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,370
print the user name will label tenant tenant label respectively.

36
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,510
Name and user name of the.

37
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,290
Customer.

38
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,930
After that, there is a label for the type setting its font size and adding that to our frame.

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,290
Then there's a label choice C3 for which we can select the type of the card that can be my micro mini

40
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,310
or SUV type of cars for the intensity caps.

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,400
So then after that, we are setting the location for that choice and adding that to our frame.

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,910
After that, there is a show button for the details setting as background color for color and setting

43
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,110
its size and location and adding that to our frame.

44
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,750
After that, there are a label for the card setting its font size and adding that to the label.

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,330
Then there's a label setting its font size, adding that to our frame.

46
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,840
Then there is a label for the driver setting its font size and adding that to our frame.

47
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,330
Similarly, there is a label setting its font size and adding that to our frame, a label for the price,

48
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,260
setting its font type, family size and location and size, and adding that to our frame.

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,970
After that, there is a label for that which is storing null value, setting its font size type and

50
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,030
ending that total frame.

51
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,480
Then we have loaded an image to make the page attractive and added an image to the label.

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,940
Setting it font, setting its size and location and adding that to our frame.

53
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,670
After that, there is another label for the different number, setting its font size and adding that

54
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,420
to our frame.

55
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:36,550
After that, there is a label, a label setting its font type size family and its location and size

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
and adding that to our frame.

57
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,230
Then there is a random variable R, which will be used to generate a reference number.

58
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,760
After that, in the show button, we have defined public void action performed inside which we have

59
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,520
stored the selected items from those events to our source and destination.

60
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,170
Then we have created the instance of our connection class and stored the two queries.

61
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,180
SDR inside the and SDR to the queries will be select as from customer, where username will match and

62
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,790
select asset from intercity, where destination and type will be matched from the 33. get selected item.

63
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:14,050
We will be executing a string to query and after that, for the next row in that table from our database,

64
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,960
we will be setting the values of L six and L four labels with the driver, price and car name.

65
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,510
And after that we will be executing the STR query.

66
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:29,980
For that we will be setting the name of the user in our written label and in user name in our L 12 label

67
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,870
can block the landline exception.

68
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,330
If occurs, then there is a button vocab foreground, color as white and background color as back setting

69
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,520
its location and size and adding that to our frame.

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,640
For that button, we have stored the selected items from the choices and text in our different string

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,690
variables and created a connection with our classes.

72
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,350
And we will be executing the query that delete from the app.

73
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,450
So we'll be deleting all the previous values.

74
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,290
In our interactive table and we will insert the current values or the fresh values which will have just

75
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,310
inserted by the user and which will be stored in our Interac app.

76
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,420
Then we'll execute that query.

77
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,790
And so the dialog box that can book successfully.

78
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,960
After that, there is a back button for the console which will help us to create the set, the visibility

79
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,270
of the current window as false, and then the sizes aged 60 plus 600 and its location 500, comma 2020

80
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,070
and its visibility as true.

81
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,320
So this is all about the intensity cap from which we will be working intensity types of caps.

82
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:30,520
Let's go to the Billboard cap to Java file, which will help us to show all the interest types of cap

83
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,000
details.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,840
So this is a cap booking system defined inside the package cap booking system.

85
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,770
We have imported the necessary package for this class and we have defined extending the frame.

86
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,730
And then there is a private type of panel content and choice.

87
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,610
Even inside the main function, we have defined the public void method inside which we have created

88
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,390
the current and current instance of the class and set the visibility as true.

89
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,770
Then we have defined its parameter as constructor.

90
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,350
Set the boundaries for 50 comma 20 2000 size will be one fifth 1050 cross 600.

91
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,140
After that, we have loaded an image and scaled this instance and then added that image to our label

92
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,770
and set its size and location for that label, adding that label to our frame.

93
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:19,090
After that there is a label named as well cap details and setting its font family size and setting its

94
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,010
location and adding that our frame.

95
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,420
Then there is a label, a customer name setting its location size and adding that to the label.

96
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,520
Then there is another label setting this location size, adding that label.

97
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,810
Then there's a label named as driver name, setting its location size, adding that to a label, setting

98
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,740
another label, setting its location size, and adding that also to our label.

99
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:46,600
Similarly for the source label, destination label, car label, we are doing the same thing and for

100
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,180
the ID label as well, just the location for each and every label will be different to formatted better

101
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,230
in our window.

102
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,780
Similarly for the phone label, address label.

103
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,640
Then there is a label for the price label arriving in label reference number label and.

104
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,150
Then inside the tribe.

105
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:12,970
Look, we have created the connection and we have executed the result set very inside which we are passing

106
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,850
liquids select extract from an app where username will match.

107
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,850
So from the Interac app we will be selecting the user name and for all the records for that particular

108
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:27,400
record where the username will match, what we are doing is we are storing the values in our null labels.

109
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,360
L2 Inside l23, four, five, l, nine and l 11.

110
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,190
After that we are executing the query that select extract from the customer will user name will match.

111
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:44,600
So for that particular username, we are restoring the values in L1 in name in L1 ID type with the reference

112
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:50,090
number in L six and inside L seven phone number and inside L address.

113
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,290
It will be used to define the random number and then we will be closing the connection.

114
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,940
After that, there is a button exit which will help us to move back from this window.

115
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,580
Similarly, we have defined the action performance inside, which set the visibility of the current

116
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,060
windows false and set setting the location size for that window.

117
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:17,030
Background colours black foreground colour is white and adding that button to our content pane and background

118
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,020
colour as white.

119
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,530
So this is the will book, the Captain Java file.

120
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,990
After that, there is a blue intensity gap.

121
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:30,050
So with the help of this class, we will be having a look at the gap of type intensity.

122
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,150
So this is also defined inside the package.

123
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,050
Lookup booking system.

124
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,450
We have imported the necessary packages.

125
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,980
I defined our class, which is extending the frame.

126
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,280
There is a content pane and see my choice inside the wide run method.

127
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,830
We have defined the correct distance and the visibility has to.

128
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,090
After that we have defined its parameterized constructor and set the size and location for the frame.

129
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,390
Then we have loaded the image to make the webpage application page more attractive and adding that image

130
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,710
to our lens and label and set the location and size for that label.

131
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,060
Adding that label to our frame.

132
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,540
Now similarly, as we have did that, I added the details in our book CAP.

133
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,550
We are doing the same thing in the inner city boot camp.

134
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,010
The only difference will be I'll be showing you.

135
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,390
Till then we are adding a label, its font, family type size, setting its location and adding that

136
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:25,810
to content.

137
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,010
Similarly, we are doing for the here for the customer name.

138
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,230
It's a label in which the customer name will be stored from the database.

139
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,400
Then the driver name its respect on a label, then the source label.

140
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,810
It's respect to the label.

141
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,790
Similarly for the destination, it's respect on a level car name.

142
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,140
It's respect on a level.

143
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,090
Then there is a type.

144
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,180
Now this label is new because in intercity vocab there is a type of the cars as well.

145
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,260
So the type can be of a mini micro or SUV.

146
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,490
So that label is extra here in this class and then it's respect to label for that type.

147
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,450
Then the phone number of the user, it's respect to label and it's address, it's respect to label price

148
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,700
and respect to label for the price arriving in respect to label for the arriving in label, then there

149
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,820
is a reference number, respect to label for the reference number.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,240
Now we have created the connection statement, connection and stance of our icon class inside the results

151
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,890
and we are executing the query select extract from interactive where username will match and we are

152
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,880
storing the respective values like drive value of the name of the driver in L to source an l three destination

153
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:47,570
in L for car name in l five type in l six call price in l nine and car reference number in l11.

154
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,110
Then we will be executing the query from selecting extract from customer where user username will match.

155
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:01,940
So what we are doing in this is storing the value of one a name in one phone in HL7 and addressing it.

156
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,750
Then we have defined the random variable are.

157
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,930
Four the minutes to generate few minutes in which the car is arriving.

158
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,730
Then we will be closing the connection.

159
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,860
After that, there is a button exit in which we have defined the set visibility of the current window

160
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,920
as false, setting the bound location and size for that window.

161
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,410
Background color and foreground color for that button.

162
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,390
And adding that button to our content pane.

163
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,680
And at last we have defined.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
The complete color for the background window as white.

165
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,020
So this is all about the three classes which we have discussed in this video.

166
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,930
These classes were booking the intensity gap, showing the details of the intensity gap and then showing

167
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,280
the details for the build intensity type of mode gap.

168
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,670
So this is all in this video.

169
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,330
We will be talking about the next classes in our next videos.
