WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.870
So the next thing which we need is the user input.

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.930
So how you get input from the user?

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:21.930
So using the scanner object we will write string input and which will be equal to the next.

4
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.800
Nine.

5
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.510
Okay.

6
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.480
So here pretty simply, we are just going to call one matter from.

7
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.210
We have called a string input and here we get the input from the of the user.

8
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.990
So whatever the user typed in, we are going to get that input and we are going to say it's equal to

9
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.760
in which our scanner object.

10
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.820
Right.

11
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.970
And we said our next line and as simple as that, at our next line, grab the next line from the console,

12
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.390
which is basically if I run this, I can show you.

13
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.600
So you can see our game's already set.

14
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.410
I know.

15
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.230
Just previously.

16
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.860
First here the setup kind.

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.810
Okay.

18
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.790
I know we're not finished yet, but you can see.

19
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.590
Welcome to the dungeon here and it gives your HP here.

20
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.430
What would you like to do with your enemy?

21
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.220
And so we are presented with the options and then we can type in one, two, three.

22
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.730
We are going to add some validation to make sure they have paid a valid option or not.

23
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.510
One and the two.

24
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.180
Three.

25
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.930
Do not.

26
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.130
So the next thing which you need a matter.

27
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.190
Which OC.

28
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.120
The next thing we need is the validation to make sure they have picked a valid option.

29
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.200
Basically when I click one and hit Enter or when I type an input and hit enter, it's basically after

30
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.540
you hit enter this input.

31
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.350
Here is what this mapper returns this next line.

32
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.880
It returns whatever you type after you press enter.

33
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.600
So in this instance, this string here would be stored in input and then we could do whatever we want

34
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.950
with so that.

35
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.950
So once we have the input we need.

36
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.370
So actually see what they want to do.

37
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.630
So I'm going to go ahead and use some statement.

38
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.890
So here we are going to see firstly if.

39
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:58.770
And here I will write in Dart equals and we have seen these string functions so as input equals when

40
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.070
we are going to do this and we are going to add LCF.

41
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.930
So firstly, I will start with the one condition here.

42
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.280
Here with two important goals.

43
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.590
One, we are going to do this this option that will.

44
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.760
Yeah.

45
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.310
We are going to add input articles to.

46
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.580
We'll do something else and then I'll have input articles and three.

47
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.050
We will do something else.

48
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.760
And then finally, we will have our final Elsa's Elsa statement.

49
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.840
Without that, if we saw if all else fails, we are going to do this.

50
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.090
This is going to be our validation.

51
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.220
So if it's not equal to be one or the two or the three, the user has not typed in anything valid.

52
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.580
And we are going to go ahead.

53
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.630
So the next.

54
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.890
Firstly, I will just start first.

55
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.480
Now what I have the first will be the Elsa.

56
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.290
So in start.

57
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.940
Equals here.

58
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.120
And just set it to two.

59
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.020
And if.

60
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.420
Okay.

61
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.470
The three.

62
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.800
The last one will be the elsewhere.

63
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.660
The validation part will go.

64
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.180
So here I have the user.

65
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.780
The validation will be the user has not typed in anything valid.

66
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.830
So we are going to go ahead and here I have used the LS statement here and just repeat the load.

67
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.470
We are going to go and back up to here.

68
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.560
So the first thing we have to do for input one firstly here for the input one.

69
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.030
Is to attacking the enemy.

70
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.020
That's what we have offered the user the first terrorist attack.

71
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.210
So here.

72
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.080
If they press one, we are going to attack the enemy.

73
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.780
Now, there is a few things we are going to do.

74
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.140
But this we are firstly going to set up two integers.

75
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.280
Okay.

76
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.530
So and we are going to say first one will be here, I will write damage.

77
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.570
Firstly, just write it and then I will.

78
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.900
Okay then you ought to have done right.

79
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.640
Not sorry

80
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.630
or not

81
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.910
mixed in

82
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.870
that.

83
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.710
Okay.

84
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.100
The under one integer damage taken.

85
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:21.590
Our dot next and under that world barometer of anime.

86
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.150
Attack damage.

87
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.260
Okay.

88
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.830
So the first thing we will have to do for input, one we have offered the user.

89
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.220
Firstly, no.

90
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.770
So there we have set up the two integers.

91
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.000
So we are going to say integer damage deal here and the integer damage taken.

92
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:56.390
Now, whenever you attack the enemy, you are going to deal some damage to them and they are going to

93
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.040
deal some damage to you.

94
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.910
So that's how the attack mechanism in this game is going to work.

95
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.520
So the damage deal is going to be equal to the random dot next.

96
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:16.610
And again, this matter generates a random number, random number between zero and the number you put

97
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.890
between these brackets.

98
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:27.500
The random damage that we are dealing is going to be between zero and our attack damage that we have

99
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.070
here.

100
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.570
So you can add these variables as you wish.

101
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.280
So random attack, damage.

102
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.850
So we are going to generate a random number between zero and 50.

103
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.650
We have 30 zero and 50.

104
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.040
Now, the damage taken is going to be equal to or not next.

105
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:59.090
And it's going to be pretty much the same thing, except we are going to go for the enemies attack damage.

106
00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.630
Right.

107
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:07.640
So instead of over attack damage, we have got two variables here, damage field and the damage taken.

108
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.630
And they are equal to the random numbers between zero and the values we have settled on these variables

109
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:23.600
here, the attack damage and enemy attack damage here 30 and the 25.

110
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.100
So we need to do now, we simply need to take the health, the damage and take the number of it from

111
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.830
the enemy's health, the damage taken.

112
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.450
Take that away from our health so we could do that.

113
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.710
Pretty simple.

114
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.870
And we have seen it before.

115
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.650
We can say enemy health minus equals.

116
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.820
So here I will write enemy health.

117
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.150
We just put minus equals the damage to yield.

118
00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.580
Okay.

119
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:09.160
And here just put health my know plus equal to damage taken

120
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:22.120
so we could do here we have we can say enemy health minus equals to damage deal and the hell this plus

121
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:33.070
equals damage taken so our health variable here our maximum previous health we are going to do my okay.

122
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.030
It will be the minus.

123
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.090
Sorry, the my minus one.

124
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.500
Okay.

125
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.110
Minus with the enemy.

126
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:40.930
Right.

127
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.980
So here, the one that we set up at the start, which is right now maximum health we are going to use

128
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.070
to minus it from the damage here.

129
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.720
Damage deal here.

130
00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:01.870
So you can see now whenever the user inputs one, we are going to have random amount of health from

131
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.620
the enemy.

132
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.750
Then slowly but surely, enemy health will become less than zero.

133
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.130
So we will break out the while loop.

134
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.700
And then down here.

135
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.980
Here, down here.

136
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.210
Okay.

137
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.180
Mainly what we have to do.

138
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.070
Just a minute.

139
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:28.640
Slowly, we will take the enemy and it will become the zero less.

140
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.140
Okay.

141
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.820
So we will break out of the loop here and then down.

142
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.860
We are going to add some stuff.

143
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.810
And seeing you defeated the enemy.

144
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.140
Okay, we can put it.

145
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.110
You are defeating our enemy.

146
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.340
So.

147
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.860
Okay, firstly, I will do.

148
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:59.300
Firstly, I will print these variables by using system not case.

149
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.420
This not all dot print linear.

150
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.450
And notice I will write tabbed.

151
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.580
You strike the.

152
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.850
No enemy.

153
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.030
Nurse or.

154
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.620
Now my.

155
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.960
And just put the damage.

156
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:59.700
I'm done next which I need system dot dot print linear and simply take tab D and here I will write you

157
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.050
receive.

158
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.020
In.

159
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.770
What should I say?

160
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.910
A word which we need.

161
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.850
In that mistaken it should write.

162
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.050
Retaliation here.

163
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.390
Okay.

164
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.890
So we have added this system order print lines.

165
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.040
So now again, I have set this up beforehand.

166
00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.530
So we are going to go ahead and tab and then we do.

167
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.370
Greater than sign here.

168
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.800
So here the greater sign.

169
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:14.110
Then we are going to see you strike the anatomy.

170
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:23.020
And here I have concatenate the name of the enemy and then say four and then concatenated the damage

171
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.120
deal and then the word damage.

172
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:33.970
So it's basically going to say you strike the enemy, name of the enemy for the X or the Y amount of

173
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:34.630
damage.

174
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:42.610
So whatever this damaged out variable was done blow were are going to pretty much do the same thing.

175
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.610
We are going to say system or print island.

176
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:53.530
Now we are going to go ahead and tap the backslash D and then we do the greater symbol here and then

177
00:13:53.530 --> 00:14:01.870
we will see you see and concatenated the damage taken variable value and in retaliation.

178
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:06.640
So you receive the x amount of damage in retaliation.

179
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:14.140
So we have the values we have told the user and what value to all the player, what has happened in

180
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.800
the game.

181
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:22.870
And then we are going to go ahead and add a little check if we check here after that.

182
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:32.450
After that we will just create some check and we have check if happen.

183
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.510
We have tried and we are actually have not killed the enemy.

184
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.810
So firstly, I have.

185
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.620
What I can see.

186
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.460
If you have haven't kill the enemy.

187
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:52.140
If the enemy is killers, we are going to add a little if a statement and here we are going to say if

188
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.110
firstly, check with our health first.

189
00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:05.250
So here I will write if our health is less than or just equal or equal to zero here.

190
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:13.220
And we can simplify and just see if our health is less than okay.

191
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.670
And.

192
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:19.660
Just zero.

193
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.340
Take it.

194
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.040
Let's see if our health is less than or equal to the zero.

195
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.580
So we will simply write system order for.
