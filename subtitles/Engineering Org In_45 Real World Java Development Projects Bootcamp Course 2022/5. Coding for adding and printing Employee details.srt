1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,150
So in this video, we will be talking about the next classes.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,310
Those our classes will be new employ and list employ.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,120
So these two classes we will be talking about in this video.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,010
So name class will be used to add an employee to in this project.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,250
So let's just start its explanation.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,450
So import Java SQL will help us to connect with our database.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,810
That's why we have imported that package and import java export string will be helping us to create

8
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:38,230
a better graphical user interface and Java JWT will help us in the Abstract Window Toolkit package,

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,690
which will be used to create graphical user interface application or Windows and after that.

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,550
We have imported Java event which will help us to handle events over the buttons.

11
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,190
After that, what we are doing is there is a public class new employ which is extending the frame and

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,260
implementing the interface accent listener.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,620
After that data, we have initialized the seven labels and seven text fields.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,690
Then we have two buttons and one choice.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,970
Now we have defined our non parameterized constructor of a new employer class heading as new employee.

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,460
Then we have set the size of the frame as 600 comma 650 and the location has 600, comma 200 and its

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,020
background color as white.

18
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,180
Then we have defined a panel P setting its background colour as white and its layout with the help of

19
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,360
grid layout, which is eight comma two and ten comma 40.

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:47,670
Then we have defined the label, new label as a name and a text field with size as 15, adding both

21
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,980
the label and the text field to our panel.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,100
After that, what we are doing is we are creating a choice seven as equals to new choice.

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,390
Then we are we are adding choices to that instance of choice.

24
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,590
Seven Add male and female, so that choices will be four selecting the gender of that particular employee,

25
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,410
which we will be adding in our database.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:19,200
So after that there is a label l two gender and we have added that L two label to our panel and that

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,510
choice instance to our panel.

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,350
After that, we have defined another label as address and its respective text field of maximum size

29
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,100
15.

30
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,390
And we have added the address label and its respective text field both to our panel.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,070
After that, we have defined a label for which is for the state, and to enter that state we have defined

32
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:50,760
a text field of size, maximum size 15, and we have added that label for and text field for to our

33
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,360
panel.

34
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:59,460
After that, we have defined the label city and also its respective text field, which is of maximum

35
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,480
size 15.

36
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,850
We have added the label of state and its text field to our panel.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,570
After that, what we are doing is we have defined the label L six labeled as email and then we have

38
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,380
defined the text field of maximum size 15.

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,200
Then we have added the label L six and text 56 in our panel.

40
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:31,700
After that there is a label L seven which is labeled as phone, which is be used to enter the phone

41
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:39,170
number with respect to text 57, which is a text field of maximum size 15 then p one dot add.

42
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,900
It will add the label seven to our panel one and the text field segment to our panel one.

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,440
After that, what we are doing is we have defined one new button submit and another button as cancel.

44
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,240
So the submit button will be used to submit the data of the employer to our database and the cancel

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,110
button will be used.

46
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:07,640
If we want to cancel from that window or program or application, then we have added both the buttons

47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,970
B1 and B to to our frame or panel.

48
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:19,220
After that, we have set the layout as new border layout and added another label with the image icon

49
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:27,890
by passing its path of the image to our class load or get system resource at the location of West.

50
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,610
Now we have added B1 at the center panel with the help of border layout.

51
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,750
So we have passed center.

52
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,100
So we are adding that panel.

53
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,920
Also after that we have defined actions not over the button one its background color and foreground

54
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,840
color as black and white.

55
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,870
Similarly for the button two, we are adding actually its background color as black and foreground color

56
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,590
as white.

57
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,190
Now we have defined the method action performed with method which is taking argument as.

58
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,390
Action event.

59
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:10,410
Now inside it's an inside which in a string and we have stored the text from the text field.

60
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,200
Even inside a string, we have a store of the item selected from the choice.

61
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:23,420
Even inside a string a we have a stored the text field content of the text field three inside the string

62
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,510
as we have stored the content of the text field for inside Siva is told the content of the text field.

63
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,250
T five Inside the string.

64
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,490
E We have stored the content of the text field three six Similarly for the PE, we have stored the content

65
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,870
of the TW seven as well.

66
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,570
After that we have defined a string.

67
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,620
Q are y which will be storing the query to insert the data into our table employ.

68
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,030
So that's in into employer values.

69
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,110
That these are the values which we will be storing in our.

70
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,560
Employ a table now inside the tribe log.

71
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,810
What we are doing is we are first creating our database connection with the help of our con class,

72
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,870
which we have discussed in our second video of this project.

73
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,840
Now 7.8 Start Execute Update Query.

74
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,150
Which will be executing that query so that the data must be updated to our employer table.

75
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,900
And after that there is a dialog box appear after successful updation of the data and it will show that

76
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,070
employer created.

77
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,530
Then we will set the visibility of the.

78
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:39,600
Current window as false and after that we will cancel the exception if any occurs inside the public

79
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,770
static void main.

80
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,600
What we are doing is we are creating the new employ instance and set the visibility as true.

81
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,650
Let's have a look at another class that is a list employee which will be used to show all the employees

82
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,170
which we will have added to our database.

83
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,060
Here is the list in my class.

84
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,270
So we have imported the package java SQL to connect with our database.

85
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:13,640
Java starts with strict Java JWT and Java JWT and after that, what we are doing is we have defined

86
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,650
a public class list employer which is extending frame and implementing accent listener.

87
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:27,350
Inside which we have defined a table and stance on a button instance B1 And we have defined a area of

88
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:37,010
a string which is a string and bid name, gender address, state, city, email ID and phone number.

89
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,730
After that, we have defined the two dimensional string array, which is new, a string of size 20 plus

90
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,240
eight.

91
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,430
Then we have defined the two variables as equals to zero, and this goes to zero of integer type.

92
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,700
After that, we have defined our class.

93
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,960
Constructor which is a non parameter constructor list employ heading as will employ and set the size

94
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,640
as 1000 comma four and red and its location as 450.

95
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,550
200.

96
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,540
Inside the tribe log.

97
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:19,200
We have created a spring queue which will be storing select aspect from employ and then we have defined

98
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,380
our connection C1 as equals to new coin, which will be creating the instance of our COIN class, which

99
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,210
will help us to create with the database.

100
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,930
After that we have executed the results set out as as close to seven as execute query which we will

101
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,010
be executing the query.

102
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,900
Q and insight.

103
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,140
Q What we have stored is select extract from employer.

104
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,540
Now, while I restart next.

105
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,680
So I restart next.

106
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,210
What it does, it will iterate over the records every row of that particular table.

107
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:57,670
And we are storing the record of every row and every column into our two dimensional array, which we

108
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,110
have created so far.

109
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,640
Day zero zero.

110
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,470
The idea of the first employee will be stored inside the d01.

111
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:11,860
The name of the first employer will be stored similarly from for the zero two the gender will be stored.

112
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,890
Then address the state, city email and phone.

113
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,680
So as soon as the first data is, data of the first row will be stored in the two dimensional array.

114
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,480
What we are doing is we are incrementing the value of I, so I will move to the next row of that two

115
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:34,210
dimensional array and J will be moved back to the zero so that we will be storing now the second data

116
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,260
of the second row into our second row index in this two dimensional area.

117
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:51,040
Now Jeevan is close to new table inside which we are past the two dimensional array and list and a string

118
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,940
area of that.

119
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,680
The number of columns or the name of the columns.

120
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,680
Then inside the cache block we will be handling any exceptions.

121
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,970
If occurs, then we have defined a button new button print and added that button at the south location.

122
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:13,950
After that, we have defined the scroll panel as one new scroll panel, G1, and passed the argument

123
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,630
of Java in that scroll panel.

124
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,600
So what G1 is a given is a table, basically.

125
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,280
So to apply a scroll panel over that particular table.

126
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,170
We have created that scroll panel and past the table and stance into it.

127
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,110
After that, we have added that scroll panel to our frame and we have defined the action as over that

128
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,610
button also.

129
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,830
Now after that arc, we have defined the action performance method which is taking action event A and

130
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,980
inside the drive log try block.

131
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,060
What we are doing is g1 print.

132
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,820
So what is the use of this German print?

133
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:59,590
This will open the printing page for that particular record and inside the cache block we will be handling

134
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,040
any exceptions if occurs and public static void main.

135
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:10,870
Inside this we will be calling them creating the instance of new list employ and set the visibility

136
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,620
as true.

137
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,820
So this is all about the two classes which we have discussed in this video.

138
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,990
The first class is a new employer, which will help us to add the employees to our database.

139
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,860
And second is the list employee, which will help us to retrieve the all the record of the employees

140
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,090
and have a look on that record in our application, which we are creating.

141
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,710
So that's all in this video.
