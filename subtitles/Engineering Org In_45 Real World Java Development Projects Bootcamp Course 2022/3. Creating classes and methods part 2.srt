1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,540
In previous videos or in previous project steps.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,650
What we did is we created a one class email class.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,960
We created one scanner class which is public.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,010
Always remember the scanner is global.

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,590
I will write here also.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,570
Global.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,410
This is global.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,350
You can use this all in this project.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,120
Then these are private.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,890
These are strings.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,770
Also are global.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,120
You can use this inside this email class and we are going to use it inside this class also.

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,820
So all these are about creating class.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,560
We already created this class.

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,340
Now we created one constructor to receive first name and last name.

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,670
Now, what is the significance of constructor is if I am putting here only these parameters I'm putting

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,110
here, it is not like abstract or something you can you are using that class and you are not securing

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,290
it.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:08,520
Anyone can change that part like your private if name for first name or last name, they can change

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:08,740
it.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,960
So significance of this is creating constructor is to receive first name and last name and protect that

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,870
from original one, which is private string and first name and last name.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,410
So let's move further.

24
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,640
Now, in this constructor, what I'm going to do.

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm going to assigning this f name to this F name.

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,240
To do this.

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:34,550
What?

28
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,350
We are going to use this keyword.

29
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,140
This dot f name.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,040
Is equal to F name.

31
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:52,730
Similarly for this also like this last name, Elin, basically.

32
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,550
A name is equal to a name.

33
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,150
So what happened is.

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,620
You can see this and these are equal now.

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,570
So it is not just forwarding the value.

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,090
It's copying that value from here to here when we are going to run this program.

37
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,190
No.

38
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,710
I'm going to print output system.

39
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,520
Not out.

40
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,890
Not print a line.

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,110
Inside this, I'm going to bring like new.

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,410
Employee.

43
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,760
Let's.

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,180
This board is named.

45
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,390
Unless I'm going to do some small gap year in between and then this dot.

46
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:44,620
And.

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,330
So we are done with constructor.

48
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,410
Now inside this, we are going to develop more in this one sector.

49
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,090
So I am leaving some space here.

50
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,750
Now we are going to create some methods.

51
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:07,180
So from the PowerPoint and that template, we already know we want to create some email, generate mail,

52
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,080
generate password.

53
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,510
For that we need to create some methods.

54
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,860
So let's start with creating some methods here.

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,210
So let's begin with.

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,660
Some department asking the department and then password or.

57
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,950
Let's start with generating email.

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,120
Generic.

59
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,840
Me.

60
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,230
Okay.

61
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,510
Male method.

62
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,210
Now, remember, this should be private.

63
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,020
So I'm creating private.

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,750
It's not really that.

65
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,220
You have to always create it private.

66
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,480
You can create it public.

67
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,840
But to achieve the abstraction, I'm going to use private.

68
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,460
It's going to return string.

69
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,430
So string generate.

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,420
Email.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,010
These are the same types of creating methods.

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,670
Now what?

73
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,970
It will return.

74
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,380
It will return email.

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,520
This format is this dot f name.

76
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:14,320
So if you are putting first name in capital and email is always in small letter to convert this to all

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,710
small letters, there is system default method or we can say user library to lowercase.

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,250
You can see two lowercase.

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,640
You can put two lowercase here.

80
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,170
So what it will do if you are putting all the capitals, even if you are putting all the capitals,

81
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,240
it will create to the small case.

82
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,240
Similarly, this dot we know.

83
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,120
Okay, okay.

84
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,200
Before that we need to put Dot here plus again this dot.

85
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,310
In Name Dot.

86
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,340
Bullock is.

87
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,010
Now we want to put your address in bold.

88
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,400
So it.

89
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,240
Oh.

90
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,780
Then this dot.

91
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,050
Department deputy.

92
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,880
Not again to lower case.

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,000
This syntax, as I told you about all the syntax here.

94
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,170
Let's now simply dot company.

95
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,650
Dot com simple remaining.

96
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,890
So what it will do, it will take first name, last name from user, and it will put with the department.

97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,570
It's just letting them in.

98
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,590
Now we will move further.

99
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,850
So what we did is we created first method for we we are going to move in the second method asking for

100
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,840
department, asking or department.

101
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:39,970
Again.

102
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,250
Private, private string.

103
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,950
State Department.

104
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,050
Since we began putting in.

105
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,190
No.

106
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,880
I need to put some user interaction.

107
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,290
I'm not going to send directly you for that administrator.

108
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,720
It will ask which department do you want to put?

109
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,480
So I will put here first system.

110
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,820
Not all dot println.

111
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,760
Depart.

112
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,160
Department foods.

113
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,580
Then what it will be?

114
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,640
It will print department quotes, basically.

115
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,720
Likewise.

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,340
This one.

117
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,570
For sales.

118
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,780
Remember, selection will be put in the next line.

119
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,310
Next line for new line or for new line.

120
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,590
I'm putting slash in.

121
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,510
Development.

122
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,890
Development.

123
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,060
Oh, a third department I'm going to put is for accounting.

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
Accounting department.

125
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,950
And last time building zero for.

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,690
None.

127
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,420
Nothing.

128
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,750
I'm not going to mention here anything I'm putting here?

129
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,170
None.

130
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,250
So.

131
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,910
Now.

132
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:24,370
What I want to create some loop or what we can say to choosing part here that one, two, three.

133
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:32,570
So you can go with too many cases like switch case and something, but I'm going to use your switch

134
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,160
case you can use if else.

135
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,900
But using switch case is more efficient here.

136
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,830
So I will create one flag here.

137
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,250
Let me tell you why I'm going to use your flag.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,720
Because I want to execute it again and again, like.

139
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,530
If.

140
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,620
I'm not going to execute it again and again.

141
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,350
It will generate only in first time.

142
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,440
Or we can say if you are entering first employee, it will ask I want to put form multiple in place,

143
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000
so I want to create some loop.

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,070
I'm going to use your do y loop or y, I'm going to use do y.

145
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,720
Loop is very important here.

146
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,440
I want to execute at least one time and the do y loop will execute at least one time for other loops

147
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,860
like for loop for a loop for each loop or enhanced for loop.

148
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,660
In Java there is no like condition, there is not any condition.

149
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,930
It will move for one to but do y loop will run at least one time.

150
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:40,920
So I will put do here first do if you know the syntax do then I will prepare a system.

151
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,740
I'm going to ask like System.out.println.

152
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,160
Just.

153
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,520
And Department could.

154
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,250
So this is very simple back department code.

155
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
After that, I will create one.

156
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,020
The choice would be good choice.

157
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,380
No.

158
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,570
What I'm going to do this next end so you will understand.

159
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,110
What is this?

160
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,640
S.

161
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,200
S is this scanner part?

162
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,860
Scanner.

163
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,940
Scanner part.

164
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,730
So I'm going to use this to take user input.

165
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,710
Now switch.

166
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,700
Switch.

167
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,060
As.

168
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,690
Also the switch choice.

169
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,660
I would then kiss one.

170
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,500
If you don't kiss one.

171
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,740
Then since.

172
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,300
It's if it's putting the ideal condition, you have to break it.

173
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,310
But there is not any significance for this.

174
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,280
You have to put a brake statement here.

175
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,560
But I'm going to just returning this so it will return only in one time.

176
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,320
It will not.

177
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,720
Or again and again start looping inside the switch case.

178
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:08,240
So just returning the need, any break line here is three.

179
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,770
Return.

180
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,600
We do need a return.

181
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,010
Ofcom.

182
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,910
And if case zero return on.

183
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,470
No.

184
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,440
Guess.

185
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,490
Well, it is not the.

186
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,140
Okay.

187
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,590
This.

188
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Border was, I guess, zero.

189
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,840
It would've been.

190
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,390
None.

191
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,170
That's it.

192
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:56,280
So we are done with this, but we are missing something.

193
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,610
Like we didn't want to exit that loop and we want to create some default conditions.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,530
So we are done with our logic, but we are not done with our perfect code.

195
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,570
Let me complete that one part.

196
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,560
Also default.

197
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,020
I will print your system.

198
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,870
Dot, dot, println.

199
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,910
Invalid.

200
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,820
Joyce.

201
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,530
These.

202
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,160
Through.

203
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,270
Again.

204
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,200
Now we are done with this no switch case.

205
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,080
Now I will end up with the well.

206
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,880
So this is do part of it.

207
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,170
So I will put a file.

208
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,930
It's like.

209
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,980
So what did you do as flag is always false.

210
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,930
Not always true.

211
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,220
It will return null.

212
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,140
That's it.

213
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,740
So what it will do.

214
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,810
It will execute at least one time.

215
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,750
Written.

216
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,090
Not.

217
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,850
So.

218
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,550
Now we are done with this part.

219
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,030
As you can see what we did here.

220
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,640
Let me summarize this.

221
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:19,280
So what we did is we created one constructor, public email string, first string, last name with parameters

222
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,300
we.

223
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,670
Invoking it with this name, dot f name.

224
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:29,260
So what we are doing, we are going to assign this F name to this f name, this last name, to this

225
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,320
last name, and I'm going to print this here.

226
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,070
So now constructor part is not done.

227
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:43,120
We are going to create and invoke some other methods also there, but its initial condition for the

228
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,810
constructor.

229
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,320
Now I started with our methods.

230
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,140
I created first private string generated method.

231
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:57,940
So what it will be do it will do generating the mail according to our syntax.

232
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:05,140
So return this dot name dot to lowercase into dot, this dot or these are the lines.

233
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,250
So what is the significance?

234
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,060
These are f name.

235
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,570
It will look this f name here dot two lowercase.

236
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,970
It will convert all the strings into lowercase.

237
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,420
So no need to worry about uppercase and lowercase.

238
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,530
Then dot.

239
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,280
Then again this for last name and this for department.

240
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,470
These for the company dot dot com.

241
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,290
So it will generate that mail according to that.

242
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:32,440
After that I want to set department, but setting the department is all about the process from user

243
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,120
or we can say administrator.

244
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,260
So I will put here one, two, three and zero for the options sales development accounting respectively.

245
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,230
Then I will create one boolean flag to execute that loop.

246
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,850
I'm going to use your Dubai loop because it will at least run one time.

247
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,470
Again, the department code or choice I'm giving.

248
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,690
I'm using switch and switch.

249
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,420
Case method here.

250
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,680
Switch.

251
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,310
Case conditions you can use if l conditions also.

252
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,150
But it will take too much time to execute that to reduce time complexity.

253
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:11,460
I use switch choice case one case for case two for development and according to that default condition,

254
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,080
execute exiting that way, loop with the flag and returning.

255
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,280
So I created two methods generator mill and said department.

256
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,440
So now we are done with this.

257
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:29,770
So I will explain what is the significance of this in part also.

258
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,790
So this will assign the you understood that part.

259
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,360
So let's try it.

260
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,920
What is this part?

261
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,760
So let me show you.

262
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,770
What is this?

263
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,820
Significances.

264
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,380
So this is the this is the reference variable that returns the current object.

265
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,750
It gives states and behavior of the object.

266
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,620
It simply leaves global variable and class variable.

267
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,450
All the same.

268
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,970
You want to invoke it same, it will assign it and we just did it.

269
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,800
The global variable is different and class is also same for that purpose.

270
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,240
We just use this one.

271
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,890
If this is not used here, it will return null value.

272
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,340
If local variable and instance variable are different, there is no need to use if.

273
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,730
What difference are different?

274
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,630
Like global is different.

275
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,470
Class variable is different, but you want to assign it to is equal to is equal to.

276
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,930
You can do it, but name should be different.

277
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,660
So avoiding using different names.

278
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,630
I used your this keyword and this is very efficient.

279
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,760
Also, this can be used to invoke current class constructor.

280
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:40,190
What I did in this part to invoke the current class constructor.

281
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,210
So we will move further with another method.

282
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,020
Also here.

283
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,080
So let us see what other methods we are going to see.
