1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:07,720
In previous tutorials, I told you how we are going to create this project, which is basically every

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,330
project.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,580
So this is our title page and I will create here.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,350
Welcome to the.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,890
So this is our name.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,720
What I can do is like this.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,740
Okay, so these are the basic names and.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,410
I'm going to create two things here or library and login.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,110
And another thing is admin login.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,630
So first, create admin login.

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,010
Admin login is very simple.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,610
As I told you, this is importing lavatories I will put here.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,100
Including.

14
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:58,090
Libraries for the library, do post commentaries for the postings and I'm going to add some things like

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,430
admin log in form.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,070
So we are remaining with now I will create one lab home which is basically going to the navigation page

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,640
again.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:14,210
So let me create one Web page, which is navigation on this very simple page.

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,680
I'm going to create.

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,170
Let me delete this first and I will add that now home page.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,940
So this is my navigation homepage.

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,830
So once this is clicked in this and it will go to this part now, I mean, it's basically the first

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,680
page of this form for going to index page again and Liberian and Liberian page and logo.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,940
So I have to create logo admin part also here.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,060
So let us see how we can create logout admin.

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,220
So it should be in servlet.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,160
So let me mention that part also.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,470
So let's.

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,670
Not.

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,690
As you can.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,500
As you.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,640
If you know this.

33
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,920
And also copy edition.

34
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,930
We'll put this again here.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,860
So now let me create log out admin part.

36
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,540
Also let me control see this.

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,750
This should be the new logo in Finnish.

38
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,250
Finnish?

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,140
So this is my lobotomy.

40
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,340
I will do one thing.

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,580
I will optimize these inputs using star.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,860
Then again, using.

43
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,510
Studying and.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,940
Eugene, start here again.

45
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,940
So no need to do this.

46
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,770
No need to.

47
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,860
Require this part also.

48
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,900
New York process, request and everything is required here.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,550
So there's nothing but.

50
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,840
Okay.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,530
So this is my class and I'm importing languages now.

52
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm importing one another library.

53
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,540
It is basically.

54
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,010
Java X dot servlet.

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,080
Dot annotations, basically because annotation is basically is overriding.

56
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,550
Annotation dot dot dot oc.

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,790
So now I'm done with everything.

58
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,810
So.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,620
Let me add one thing here.

60
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,130
I did it with solid.

61
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,580
And so in this bracket.

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,370
What I'm going to mention is here.

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,920
So let's not.

64
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,990
Name is local.

65
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,610
So I'm done with this.

66
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,710
Now let me create one protected one.

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,210
What I'm going to do is.

68
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,290
I'm just going to.

69
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,080
Use defaulting in.

70
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,350
I don't want to waste time in this.

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,210
I will explain this, but it is very easy for.

72
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,590
If you know this part.

73
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,530
So it will do get a request and response.

74
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,020
It throws servlet exceptional exception.

75
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,530
That's it.

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,590
So let me do something.

77
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:46,910
Okay.

78
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,540
Now I'm going to mention request.

79
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,230
Not.

80
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,030
Get session.

81
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,140
This session, not invalidate.

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,480
So what it will be do.

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,630
It will be invalidated that session directly.

84
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,520
As you can see.

85
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,980
Where it will be.

86
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,040
Go the response.

87
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,800
Send direct redirect.

88
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,230
Basically.

89
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,130
Send redirect.

90
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,530
Where should we go?

91
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,450
Index dot html.

92
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,290
So that's it for the logo part.

93
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,850
Let me add your comments.

94
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,990
Including libraries.

95
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,350
Logout.

96
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,760
Return for.

97
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,910
I mean.

98
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,380
So now we are done with logout method of admin.

99
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:52,400
So now we required some more things, like we created an admin and you can see add library and view

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,420
library and log out.

101
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,810
So we need to create some form methods also here.

102
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,290
So this should be inside the servlet part only.

103
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:08,060
So let me create your also let me write this now why this is important.

104
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm mentioning the location of this.

105
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,310
So.

106
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,800
Once I'm done with this, I will explain you.

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,450
What is the significance of this?

108
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,330
Okay.

109
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:26,340
So for this purpose, if you see here admin login, you can see there are different request, not footer

110
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,320
or HTML for the footer part.

111
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,340
So this is nothing, but it's ending of everything.

112
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,220
Then.

113
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,860
Now home is basically the navigation home, which is similar to the index page.

114
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,400
So when you need to require this also navigation admin for admin part and it is again HTML part only.

115
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,950
As you can see, collapsing and everything, but it's showing index rotation for this and all the library

116
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,520
and part.

117
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,300
Now we are done with admin login.

118
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,830
So I'm mentioning admin login as default thing here.

119
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,520
If you want to add some more admins here, you can add using LC part.

120
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,160
Also if you want to use, you can use switch case also methods here, but I'm considering only one part

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,550
here.

122
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,310
The index estimates for the index.

123
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,800
So let me open this admin.

124
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,850
This is admin.

125
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,750
Log in and.

126
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,140
Just now we created a logo remain part.

127
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,260
So.

128
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,940
I'm done with this.

129
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,210
Now let us see inside the that part.

130
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,370
We need an admin admin library and login forms.

131
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,930
Let me copy this part because I'm going to create a new servlet.

132
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,000
Or you cannot see the dialog box because it's another window recording.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,550
But the thing is very similar.

134
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,440
You need to choose servlet.

135
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,190
You need to mention the class name, which is basically we copied name that part.

136
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,510
Then add information to deployment descriptor, which is basically XML.

137
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,820
You have to check that mark and click the finish.

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,950
Once this is done, I'm going to clear out this because.

139
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,850
We already gone through this.

140
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,490
So let me use this part.

141
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:23,130
So let me import one package is basically package solid because we are accepting that solid part.

142
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,270
Then.

143
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,130
Let me use this part again.

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,800
So I forgot to add so that also there.

145
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,300
God.

146
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:41,940
Okay.

147
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,070
Now, let me explain.

148
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,880
What is this?

149
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:53,200
So if I create a blog ad librarian form which library and form this basically tab, it should go to

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,500
the this part I level librarian form dot html.

151
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:58,770
Okay.

152
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,380
I understand.

153
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,450
So it is very simple.

154
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,400
It is just for part.

155
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,350
So let me create one HTML page for this admin login form.

156
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,140
If not, it will go to the navigation admin panel and putting that part again.

157
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,740
So new HTML page.

158
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,090
I will use this as an finish.

159
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,660
I'm creating new HTML page for this purpose.

160
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,220
So let me use some default template here, which is basically admin log in form.

161
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,310
And that's it.

162
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,410
So what is it, librarian?

163
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,250
It should be contained.

164
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,070
Name, email, address, password and mobile number.

165
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,180
So that's it?

166
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,370
We required here.

167
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,510
Let me save this and let me save this.

168
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,820
If you are not saving, you can see there is a black part here.

169
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,420
So this is admin login form.

170
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,180
I will again, I will optimize the inputs.

171
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,260
Because.

172
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,820
Optimizing imports is very important here.

173
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,460
If you want to describe all things, then it's no longer required.

174
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,030
But.

175
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,810
I'm optimizing the inputs and.

176
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,040
Importing heavily.

177
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,540
So now we are done with admin log in form.

178
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,760
So this is done.

179
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,470
But as you can see, this is admin login form and etc..

180
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,460
I as you can see there is one method is add level librarian.

181
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:47,360
So we need to create some add librarian method also to invoke that and put in the database because we

182
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,500
are going to use your database connection also.

183
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,910
So in further part, I'm going to tell you how we can going to do.

184
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,850
Always give full name for that purpose.

185
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,010
As you can see.

186
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,460
You can copy this from your also because it's in a solid package.

187
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,300
So copy this part and you can put here again.

188
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,900
Let me say this.

189
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,650
So now we are done.

190
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,370
Let me run this project first.

191
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,340
I will click clean and build.

192
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,290
So in the output window, it will take time to clean and build everything.

193
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,770
As you can see in the libraries, we added some files.

194
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:37,150
So let me add another jar folder also because we haven't had Java X Jar.

195
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,850
Let me add the Java X Jar also.

196
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,400
So now it's added.

197
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,860
And let me run this hourglass fish server.

198
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,130
So it will take time and it will be deployed on your web itself, on your web browser, through the

199
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,180
glass fishbowl.

200
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,500
Sometimes it gives the error that buildings fail.

201
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:07,250
Then there should be error in Java or something that you have to rectify that error first and then you

202
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,510
have to deploy that part.

203
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
So this is just we are doing with printing and we are facing the data.

204
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:18,030
But now what we are going to do, we are going to put that data inside the database.

205
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:23,430
But before that we need to create one user in the database, a different user.

206
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,410
If you want to use default user, you can use.

207
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,410
But I'm going to create another user for this.

208
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,230
As you can see, build is failed now while build is failed, as you can see here, module has not been

209
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,830
deployed.

210
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,480
Let us see what is different and why it is doing this.

211
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,180
So as you can see in admin librarian form, we created everything.

212
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,510
But there is something missing always.

213
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,110
Let me check now.

214
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,710
Admin each it is created.

215
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,350
Admin login form is created.

216
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:09,020
All things are created, then what is the missing part here is basically we haven't deployed every part

217
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,430
like you can see logout admin and we will leave it in solid.

218
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,380
So this is not done yet.

219
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,250
So we need to create this method also.

220
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:25,100
So in the next part I'm going to tell how we are going to create this part view library and everything.

221
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,080
So first, create one user, different user.

222
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:37,400
For this part I'm going with default user, but if you want you can create another user for database

223
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:46,010
and you have to execute some queries there because you need to execute that part and going to store

224
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,720
that part inside the database.

225
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:54,860
So in further videos, we are going to create each and every part here and I'm going to show how we

226
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,900
can execute this because we haven't mentioned some part here.

227
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,360
Lake View.

228
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,280
Lebanon is not declared so.

229
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,120
In the next part I'm going to create a view library and method logout method we already created.

230
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,290
So we will have a written method will be created there and we are going with that part.
