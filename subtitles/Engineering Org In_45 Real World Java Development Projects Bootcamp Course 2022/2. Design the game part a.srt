1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,350
So here I have my project by the name Minesweeper Gaming Java.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,870
Here this game consists of two classes board and a minesweeper and a saucy package.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,130
This one.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:25,190
And now we have 30 images underwater as RC slash resources directory this.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,270
So these images we will be using in our project or the program.

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,860
So what we have to do first we have to define.

7
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:39,620
Okay.

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,020
So here first we have to define the constant used in our game.

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,290
So let's start with that.

10
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,710
We will write private final and.

11
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:03,110
Give the name as the no images and.

12
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,310
Settle down.

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,150
13.

14
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,210
We know the constraints.

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,820
We will take it as in the case in our interest here.

16
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,880
And another one constraint which we need is a private.

17
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,080
Finally.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,600
And that will be the cell size set to the 15.

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,010
I don't know.

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,010
There are 13 images used in the scheme.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,290
A cell can be surrounded by a maximum of eight miles.

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,090
So we need numbers 1 to 8.

23
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,760
We need images for an empty cell, a mind, a colored cell, a model cell.

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,500
And finally, finally, for a lonely cell, the size of each of the images is 1515.

25
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,750
So for that, we need another constants.

26
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,420
And we will write primate final end.

27
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:25,190
And write it code for sale here and initialize it to the ten here.

28
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:37,740
We need another one which we will name as a private final end mark for sale and third to the ten.

29
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:46,430
Here's another one which we need private final int and that will be the empty shell here.

30
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,950
And set this 2 to 0.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,750
That's well done.

32
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
No, we need a minefield is in order.

33
00:02:59,470 --> 00:02:59,920
Okay.

34
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,720
So minefield is an array of numbers.

35
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,930
For example, zero donates an empty cell.

36
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,640
Number ten is used for a cell cover as well as for a mark.

37
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,320
Using constants improves readability of the code.

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,340
So we need another things here.

39
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,830
We will try it here.

40
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:32,360
I will write private final and give it the name mindset and set it to the line.

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,600
Know what we need.

42
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:48,380
The mindset represents a cell that contains a mine, so we have to write private, final int and write

43
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:56,420
it as a code mine cell which really equal to the mine cell.

44
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,370
And it added to the cover for sell.

45
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,100
Here.

46
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,750
Another one constant variable which we need is the private final end.

47
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:28,500
It will be me as the modeled mine cell and it will be equal to the gold mine cell added to the mark

48
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,430
for cell.

49
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,560
Here.

50
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,270
So it's done.

51
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,640
Now what we have to do.

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,180
Okay.

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,560
So now the code mindset is used for a field that is code and contains a mine, the mog the mine cell.

54
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,960
This one is a coal mine cell that was marked by the user.

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:00,210
So now we need to determine whether to draw mine a mine over a mark or a wrongly mark.

56
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,530
So for that, we have to define the variables.

57
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:13,080
So here we will write, try with final in, and here we need to mine.

58
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,250
Okay.

59
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,170
Okay.

60
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:28,800
So we will name it as the draw mine here and set it to the nine here.

61
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,740
Another one which we need is a private final and we need it.

62
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,160
Draw over here.

63
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,430
Set it to the ten.

64
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:56,660
Another one which would need to be made final in the 12 millimetres draw mark and set it to the levels

65
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:11,040
last one between we in the private final and name it and the wrong marker and it will set with that.

66
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,040
Okay.

67
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:23,780
So we have these constraints which will determine whether to draw mine a mine colour and a mark and

68
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,120
only mob cell.

69
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,290
Now which next thing which we need.

70
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,170
Okay.

71
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,280
So we have the minefield in our game which has the 40 hidden mines.

72
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:44,260
For that, we need another variable and another variable for the 16 rules and the 16 columns and the

73
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,740
field.

74
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,840
So there are 226 cells together in a minefield.

75
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:57,060
So for that, we need another retrievals and retrieval, right?

76
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,150
Primate.

77
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,490
And it will be the final in animate and stuff.

78
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,010
And mine's here and set it to 40.

79
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,470
For the hidden minds here we will write private.

80
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:31,480
I noted in Mehmet also Andrew Shearer set it to 16 last one which we need is a private final end and

81
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,270
calls here and set it to the.

82
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:35,930
Do you?

83
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,870
So here.

84
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,420
What do we have or do we have?

85
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,270
We have the minefield in our game has 40 hidden mines.

86
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,130
So there are 16 rows and 16 columns in the field.

87
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,920
So there are 226 holes together in the minefield.

88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,350
No.

89
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,480
Next thing which we need is board width and height.

90
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,910
So let's take before that.

91
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,730
What we need, we need.

92
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,750
Okay.

93
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:21,120
So firstly for the board width and the board height.

94
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,460
So here we will right

95
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,710
here, even right.

96
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:37,080
Private, and it will be the final end limit as the board.

97
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:47,970
Right here, we really call to the end calls multiplied by cell size.

98
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,300
And it will be plus one.

99
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:07,060
Next thing, we truly need private finance in need and support right here, which is equal to the end.

100
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:13,330
ROSE And it will be multiplied by cell size.

101
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,150
Okay.

102
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,860
It will be up with the one.

103
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,110
I'm done.

104
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,970
Now we need an area of the field.

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,140
The field is an area of numbers.

106
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,870
So what we will write.

107
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,780
We will write private and only by the name field.

108
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,410
The field is an area of numbers.

109
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,560
Each cell in the field has a specific number.

110
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,710
For instance, a mine cell has number nine.

111
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,840
A cell number two means it is a two, two minus.

112
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,100
The numbers are added.

113
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:01,830
For example, a cover mine has a number 19 nine for the mine and ten for the cell cover and so on.

114
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:16,200
So what we need, we need another thing which will be, as the private boolean in this endgame variable,

115
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,980
determines whether we are in the game or the game is over, next thing which we need.

116
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:24,950
Okay.

117
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:33,750
So the next thing which we need is the private and numerate as the mines left here.

118
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,780
So the mine's left variable, the number of mines to be marked left.

119
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:51,720
So this is done and now we need an array of images to store the images so we will take image.

120
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,840
I am here.

121
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,010
I'm done.

122
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,570
So firstly we have to import image.

123
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,830
Oh, this is John.

124
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,050
Now what we have to do, we will need private.

125
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,790
Okay, we are done.

126
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:19,170
Now the next another thing which we have to do, we have to load our images into the image.

127
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:28,710
The images are named here 0.1 not being G now the last will be the 12 being.

128
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,840
These are in numbers.

129
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,060
So we have to store and load our images into the image area.
