WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.270
Now it's time to do the interface part.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:12.790
Firstly, we have to solve this random thing so we will create an object or random object to shuffle

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.560
tiles.

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.900
So after this we only for this foreground color.

5
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:27.110
So we have to take the private static final data color.

6
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.190
Now we need the foreground.

7
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:49.150
For a ground color ticket is the new color and we will set the color.

8
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.450
Okay.

9
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.410
So I will take the eight comma 156, comma 239.

10
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.930
Here we use an arbitrary color here.

11
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.400
Now we need to create a random object to shuffle the tiles.

12
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.400
So a random object to shuffle tiles.

13
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.140
So here I will write primate.

14
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.310
Primate, static and final.

15
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.860
Mm.

16
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.580
Third, random, random and.

17
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.500
Right, new, random.

18
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.040
Here, parentheses, semicolon.

19
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.750
And then we have done the foreground color.

20
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.570
We have the tile size.

21
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.310
We have the only array for storing the tiles.

22
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.000
And so we do already have the matching thing.

23
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.210
We.

24
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.610
Okay.

25
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.710
So all we yeah.

26
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.550
We all really have the grid side also.

27
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.840
Now we have to calculate the grid size and the tile size.

28
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.500
Firstly, we take the J panel class, then we draw spot on the field to calculate the sizes of each.

29
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.930
So we will use the data specified in constructor parameter of the game.

30
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.730
So here I will.

31
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.630
Here.

32
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:25.460
Here I will write calculator size and tile size.

33
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.140
Here.

34
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:43.940
What we will do, we will take the variable criticized here and initialize it to the minus two and hold

35
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.650
this thing multiplied.

36
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.540
No, not the whole here.

37
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.560
This will be multiplied by the margin here.

38
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.640
I'm done.

39
00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.940
Now, for the tile size, what we will do, the tile size is equal to the great size.

40
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.560
Great.

41
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.250
We need a great size and it will divide it by the size.

42
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.170
So here we have calculated the great size and the tile size.

43
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.230
No.

44
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.670
For some user interface, what we have to do, we have to set the preferred size.

45
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.270
Said preferred.

46
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.340
Preferred size to here I will write new dimension.

47
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:50.490
And under this we will take the parameter of the dimension, comma, dimension plus margin here.

48
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.870
Okay.

49
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.810
So this Sunnis don't know.

50
00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:02.740
We have to set the background here, said Baghran, which will be our color lord.

51
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.460
We need the white

52
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.410
light here.

53
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.450
So we have said the background.

54
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.140
Now we have to set the foreground color also.

55
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.910
So what I will do, I will try to set foreground.

56
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.870
Here, take this.

57
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.860
And under this, I will write for a brown color.

58
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.860
Okay, so we're done.

59
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.600
No.

60
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.620
Next thing.

61
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.670
Which we have to do.

62
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.710
We have to set the font

63
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.660
set for.

64
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.960
Then we will take the new font.

65
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.370
And what should we take?

66
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.870
Science reporter.

67
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.600
So I will take the surf.

68
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:03.330
Simple one and after this comma and set the font we need center to look.

69
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.410
Okay.

70
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.090
Take it as a bold.

71
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.600
Bold.

72
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:19.000
And what we have to do, though, we will give the size of our phone to do something.

73
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.720
60.

74
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.870
So the sun is down now.

75
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.460
We have already created this part here.

76
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.270
We have to do one more thing.

77
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.380
We have to set our variable game over with the first so that our game will start.

78
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.470
Okay.

79
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.350
So here.

80
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.230
Okay.

81
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.220
Run our cars.

82
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.100
Okay.

83
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.240
Okay.

84
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.080
We have not done with the main thing.

85
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.890
We have to look.

86
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.340
Okay, let's do that.

87
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.460
Well, we will write.

88
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.660
We will write swing utilities.

89
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.060
Utilities dot invoke letter.

90
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.760
Know this.

91
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:44.590
Take this loop open g frame.

92
00:06:46.150 --> 00:07:03.650
Now create a frame object new frame done frame dot set default close operation.

93
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:12.400
Also under this we will create g frame and dot exit on close.

94
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.750
We need this.

95
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.150
Okay.

96
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.740
So this one is done now.

97
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.890
Here we will write frame, not set title.

98
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.860
And what we will give.

99
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.920
Game of Thrones.

100
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.200
Here I will write 15 puzzle games.

101
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.910
So I have.

102
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.380
Give the title here.

103
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.360
Another thing which we need is to.

104
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.140
Frame not set resizable.

105
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.320
Resizable and settled with the false already here.

106
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.170
Don't know what we will do.

107
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.290
We need the modern layout also.

108
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:15.560
So frame not ad in here.

109
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.180
I mean I knew.

110
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.520
Need a constructor here.

111
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.870
Setter with the four comma.

112
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.660
Food.

113
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.440
I will give the size 550 something.

114
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:48.560
On her note here with the 13th and after this comma, we need the border layout also.

115
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.690
So border layout dot.

116
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.280
Give it with the center.

117
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.060
Okay.

118
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.140
So here.

119
00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.710
Done.

120
00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.850
No frame pack done.

121
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.280
No thought.

122
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.870
However, output should come on the center of the screen.

123
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.430
So here what we will do.

124
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.750
We will write frame, not set location.

125
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.670
Really to set it to the null

126
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:31.070
frame, not set visible to the true here.

127
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.740
Well done.

128
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.740
No job application.

129
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.500
So, yeah, it's working.

130
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.890
Now we have to draw, know what we are.

131
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:53.040
So, yeah, we need to define the draw grid method to draw the grid on the spots on the screen here.

132
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.990
It's only a frame only.

133
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:08.970
What we will do here, we will see that thing where here we have in we have to the grid size and the

134
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.440
size of the tile.

135
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.670
So we have calculated the sizes of each.

136
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.700
So we will use this data.

137
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.820
Now the margin is also a parameter specified in the game constructor.

138
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:31.770
So now what we have to do, we have to define the draw grid of matter to draw the grid on sports on

139
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.430
the screen.

140
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:41.910
So what we will do, we initialize the area of X and convert the coordinates to the coordinates of the

141
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.790
user interface, then draw each tag to the corresponding number in the center.

142
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.550
So what do we have to do?

143
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.700
Firstly, we will do.

144
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.020
What should we do after this?

145
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.070
Okay.

146
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:12.080
We have to settle it with the OC after this year.

147
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:17.590
After this we will create our mascot by the name draw.

148
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:17.910
Great.

149
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:24.440
So here I will write private void emitters the draw grid.

150
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.600
Give the barometer with the graphics.

151
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.480
Woody.

152
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.910
And give it to G.

153
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.340
So under this, firstly we will take full loop.

154
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:53.870
We will convert a1d coordinator to two D coordination given the size of the 2D array.

155
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.080
So here I will take the for loop.

156
00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.890
And here I will write in.

157
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.270
I set it to the zero.

158
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.880
I is less than with the tile start length.

159
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.120
Get the increment of eight.

160
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.810
And under this we will take.

161
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:32.280
End rule as are and set with I divided by size next for the column and I is more below and size.

162
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.800
So now we will convert in correlation on the UI.

163
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:51.060
So here I will write in x is equal to the margin plus C multiplied by the tile size multiplied by the

164
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.460
tile size here.

165
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.140
Same thing with the y here.

166
00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:01.410
Margin plus here.

167
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.180
The are multiplied by tile size here.

168
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.230
Know what we will do.

169
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.550
We will check special case for the blank type.

170
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:26.910
So I will take a if condition here the tiles I get which is equal to zero.

171
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:36.150
So what it will do, it will start with the game over and check for the if game over.

172
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.350
So what it will do, do not set color.

173
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.560
We need a set color.

174
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.540
Foreground color.

175
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.290
Yeah, set color to the foreground color.

176
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:53.250
And after this, we need to draw center string, maybe

177
00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.020
third.

178
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.800
Here.

179
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.590
Okay.

180
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:12.210
Under this we will give some parameter with the g comma here.

181
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:23.480
I will take it as the backslash u2713 and give it the comma x comma.

182
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.500
Why don't.

183
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:42.650
Okay we will create this create material done after this cited to continue.

184
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:55.540
Well, after that, for the other tiles, we have to set the color and the UI part to suit all the other

185
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.350
tiles.

186
00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:06.480
So here I will write the not set colour, detailed set colour near the get foreground here.

187
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:16.510
After this we will write g dot fill run this one round react.

188
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.790
So x comma y.

189
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:22.180
Same change to the.

190
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.470
Separate to the tile size.

191
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.770
Adequate with the tile size here.

192
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:39.340
See, now the height goes to 25.

193
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.680
Same 25.

194
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:51.180
Now, another thing for the other times, we have to set the color to the black.

195
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:58.380
So here I will write, set color and set it to know.

196
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.450
Color dot black.

197
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.410
And here, draw.

198
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:21.760
Ron react here x comma y will be the same which will be changed to the title size.

199
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.240
How did we change to the tile size?

200
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.730
Here.

201
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:36.620
It will be the 25 comma, 25, not another one for the set color.

202
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.330
Change it with the color dot white.

203
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.670
You need a white one here.

204
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.730
And same with the draw round react.

205
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:55.750
No.

206
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.520
We need to draw center string.

207
00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.470
Okay.

208
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.180
Just me.

209
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.360
We have to lead out.

210
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.550
Hmm.

211
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.090
No.

212
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.010
We need the true

213
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.680
centered string here.

214
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.410
Give the parameter g.

215
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.210
Comma.

216
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.050
String not value of.

217
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.260
So to know.

218
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.670
Signs of a

219
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.020
coma and x.

220
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.160
Coma y.

221
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.760
I didn't do it.

222
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.730
It's not.

223
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.970
Grow.

224
00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.090
Okay.

225
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.950
The Como.

226
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:21.890
Okay.

227
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.050
We will take this in.

228
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.460
All we need.

229
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.440
What we have to do, we will.

230
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:34.550
Finally, we have to redefine the paint component method, which is our derivative of the draping glass.

231
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:43.070
Then we use the draw grid method, and after that we will use the draw start message method to display

232
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.730
a message promoting us to what we will see.

233
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.230
Click to start again.

234
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:55.970
So next thing we have to do, we have to make our method, draw, start, message.
