00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:11.090
Uh, so in previous things we found one error and the error is related to Java EE Web application.

2
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.330
So my suggestion is add this dependency in Java X API and that's it.

3
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.660
Now there is no other errors and these are very similar thing created and everything.

4
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.520
So let me do one thing.

5
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.660
Let me close these things because we have already seen these things.

6
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.570
So what I changed now I changed to three things here I added.

7
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.510
One involves JSP to create one in box.

8
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.960
Now remember, I'm using I am app thing.

9
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.280
You can use three things also here.

10
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.340
So why?

11
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.420
I told you creating the inbox thing is complicated because you need to handle with the file exception

12
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.140
and everything.

13
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.870
So creating inbox is very critical thing using java.

14
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.890
Other than this you can use like for this purpose.

15
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.190
JavaScript is very useful, like it is embedded but using Java is not very common thing.

16
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.660
So I created this.

17
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.390
It's very similar.

18
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.700
I added some bootstrap file, I'm using JS file and I did this for this purpose.

19
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.060
I need my this thing which is mailing thing and I am passing the file name for my email and everything

20
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:34.250
I'm doing here and code for I'm acting is just see I'm everything is basically 993 username and the

21
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.860
password filter protocol is I don't use I read the host SMTP this this is and I'm connecting this to

22
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.210
my URL now I don't want to specify the more detailed thing here.

23
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.030
I just go with some two, three old mails, not new mails in my inbox.

24
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.580
But let me show you how we can forcefully do this in this.

25
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.070
And previously I got error, and that error is regarding to this.

26
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.950
So now I rectified that error.

27
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.180
And let me show you this email utility thing.

28
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:22.820
Also, I changed a little bit, which is basically this thing and in mail client also I have one like

29
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.140
I never mentioned this thing which is basically overloading thing where I'm providing the overload,

30
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.000
which is HTTP servlet.

31
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.840
So no need to choose anything here.

32
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.630
Just close this because I added my main dependency.

33
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.210
So this is the in boxing.

34
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:48.740
So you need to do this thing, check whether these are appended or not or overwrite it or not.

35
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.100
If not, you have to override it again manually.

36
00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:01.040
So that one error I rectified I change email utility little bit, not very deeply change it a little

37
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.310
bit.

38
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.080
Some variables I changed.

39
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.040
Then let me do one thing here.

40
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.760
Let you start to optimize imports.

41
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:22.400
Like optimizing imports is a good thing to do because I don't want to specify that much things here.

42
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.460
And I just know I can remove all these things directly.

43
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.460
It's no longer required.

44
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.170
So I created this.

45
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.840
Now it's time to test it.

46
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.490
So testing is very easy.

47
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.070
Go to edit configuration field and.

48
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.130
What required thing is check your your tomcat server with 2000 to code.

49
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.740
My 2002 code is not used so I'm using this.

50
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.820
Similar to what war one, I'm going to build this.

51
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.310
So it will take time to build and performing the actions while building.

52
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.950
You can check this so.

53
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.950
Let me show you.

54
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.680
It's doing all these things and it's accessing and compiling everything.

55
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.940
So give ID to do these things.

56
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.480
While regularly developing this app, you need to add some application things and dependency.

57
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.620
Also, you can add your database also.

58
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.040
So now you can check this.

59
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.740
My Tomcat server is now running.

60
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.840
Build is successful.

61
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.830
As you can see, build is successfully 13 seconds completed and now the service is running.

62
00:04:51.190 --> 00:05:00.980
So you can add how you have to add some dependencies here in XML to perform every actions that PostgreSQL

63
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.780
will have.

64
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.980
Also providing the PostgreSQL dependency and you can perform these applications directly using this.

65
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.120
So.

66
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.620
Let me show this is my email application if you know this and.

67
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.420
Let me show you these things.

68
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.900
So.

69
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.780
So.

70
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.800
So this is my email basically and where I'm going to receive this and this is my email application.

71
00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:02.070
So let me send this is my mail test and let me put this is my test.

72
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.960
Application mail.

73
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.700
So you can add as many as you want.

74
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.170
You can use that things also.

75
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.890
And let me click send here so it will take time to perform actions.

76
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.300
Or while performing actions.

77
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:33.830
You can check all the actions in your tomcat localhost server where log where you can found that it's

78
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.970
connecting or not.

79
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.560
So let me show you when to.

80
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:44.110
You can check your IDs, adding and doing deals on everything you're doing with the Chrome tab.

81
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.480
So.

82
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.050
You can take my email sent succesfully or let me reload this.

83
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.790
So it's loading now and you can check my email I received.

84
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.310
So this is my another email I use for the temporary connection and everything.

85
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.560
You can use any other thing.

86
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.900
I can put.

87
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.140
Hi.

88
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.630
Got it as my reply.

89
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.500
So let me put this.

90
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.460
I got it.

91
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.550
So this is my test application and now it's working.

92
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:27.890
So let me show you how I created that.

93
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.930
Another thing.

94
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.690
Even when we go to this.

95
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.230
Okay, so this is my inbox and everything I read and you can check mail has been sent succesfully.

96
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.200
You can change the look of this also.

97
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.070
So let me go to the inbox.

98
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.750
So inbox is not very performed.

99
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:53.420
I created I just created as a prototype here for you to time constraints.

100
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.730
So I added some things here.

101
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:04.490
So this is my old thing I'm facing, not new thing I am fetching very old thing and fetching all the

102
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.390
emails and everything.

103
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.340
I am not handling everything here.

104
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.410
So like what is this?

105
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:16.430
You can create your own inbox, you can add here different things like contacts, you can add search

106
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.000
field.

107
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.340
I created this also using GSP so you can perform this.

108
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.490
So this is it.

109
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.770
How we can perform?

110
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.030
And as I told you, I received that mail.

111
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:38.380
But you can check here, like closing connection, a SMTP server where I'm accessing what I'm doing.

112
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.230
You can check everything and you can check for your passing and everything information from it.

113
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.640
Hope you understand.

114
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.110
Thank you.

115
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:57.620
And you can further more extended to most professional thing because this is not this is just I created

116
00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.330
a prototype.

117
00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.680
What you can do.

118
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.350
You can extend it more.

119
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.530
And you can build your own API as you can create here.

120
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.480
API Java is mostly useful for APIs.

121
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:15.790
You can create your own API or microservice for this in the form of XML, which is basically properties

122
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.540
XML.

123
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.870
You can perform these actions directly.

124
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.120
So let me show you complex and.

125
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.600
This is my complex.

126
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.670
Oh no.

127
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.980
This is in my point of XML.

128
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:46.060
So what you can do instead of adding it to mail artifact, it is different.

129
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.510
So.

130
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:56.790
Okay.

131
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.440
Now this is done.

132
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.750
Now we are good to go with the standard XML.

133
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:14.540
So you need to add some two three things here while developing on server, you need to add one field

134
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.360
to boot up your API, these things again and again.

135
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:26.860
Plus, you need to create one more thing to add to database because this is limited to only one user.

136
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:34.300
But while developing for company or industry, you need to face data from the database also.

137
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.540
So that's very easy when you display statements directly there.

138
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.020
So that's it and hope you understand.

139
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:41.770
Thank you.
