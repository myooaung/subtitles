1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,090
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:10,580
So I welcome you all to learn a new Java project in the cities of learning how to make projects in Java.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,740
So the title of this project is Build a file browser interface.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:24,210
So we are going to make this file browser interface in Java, which is going to be like this.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:34,620
So we have been using file browser our systems file browser by clicking the icon of folder in the taskbar,

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,430
which opens up all the folder folders of our system.

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:46,920
But we are going to make this file browser in Java and with the help of this application we can access

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,660
all the files and folders of our system in no time.

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,520
So are you on your screen?

10
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,120
You can see the welcome end of this application.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,310
So in this application that is going to be like this way, open your files, whether it be the C drive

12
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,980
or the divisions in your hard disk.

13
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,810
Now inside the folders, it is going to show the like in a tree like structure, it is going to show

14
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,430
the subfolders of the divisions of the hard disk in this manner.

15
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:29,040
So also in this frame you can see that there is a horizontal scroller to read the full name of the folders.

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,660
Also, there are four buttons in the bottom like footer.

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,290
We can say that this folder is containing buttons for save, rename, new file and new folder.

18
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,640
So suppose even if we want to create a new file or new folder, then also we can create this with the

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,460
help of this file browser interface.

20
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,340
So let us move forward.

21
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,880
So in this application, we are going to like make this application in Java using string and frameworks.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:11,340
We will be using all components of string and AWP in order to attach the functionalities to this application.

24
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,850
There will be classes, methods, objects as we are going to learn object oriented programming in Java

25
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,590
through this project also.

26
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,580
So initially we will be like building this frame.

27
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,280
Inside this we will be attaching panels.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,150
So yes, there will be an input like asking for the name of the new folder or file.

29
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,480
So we'll be attaching all these fields inside the application through the coding section.

30
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,100
Also we are going to like give it a tree like structure.

31
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,280
We have covered our tree in the BSC project.

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,420
We have discussed that our tree is a hierarchical data structure.

33
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,310
So this subfolder is going to be also a tree like hierarchical data structure, which is going to cover.

34
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,630
So suppose that is C, D and E, so when we open a folder, then we again open the sub folder, then

35
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,290
it is going to be like open in a hierarchical manner.

36
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,040
And that also we are going to attach in the coding section with the help of three cell renderer for

37
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
these files and folders.

38
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,320
Or the next thing we are going to attach of course for the tree we will be using the tree component

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,670
of the string library.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,710
Also we are going to attach threading or in order to like open it in a series of process.

41
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:43,380
So basically threading is combining process in like in a in that manner that things are linked to each

42
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,800
other.

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:51,990
So suppose if I open this folder then are the subfolders linked to this folder should open in a hierarchical

44
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,640
manner and that hierarchy will be only based on this folder.

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,640
No other folders will be affected by that like tree like structure.

46
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,600
So this is done with the help of threading.

47
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:14,370
Also, we are going to use event dispatches so that our specific event is dispatched.

48
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,400
We are also going to use threading in that also.

49
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,670
Okay, so we are going to add action looseness to the button, whether it be the scroll pane or these

50
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,660
four buttons.

51
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:33,060
So a separate action is attached in all the four buttons or whether it be the button inside the dialog

52
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,890
box appearing on the screen.

53
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:43,170
Also, we will be adding a back button here so that we can like if we want to go back to the main menu,

54
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,920
then we can click that bag back button and we can also.

55
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:47,670
Yes.

56
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,290
Navigate between these.

57
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,100
Hard Drive Division saw these folders or whatever it could be.

58
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,960
So what are the specifications of this project?

59
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:08,660
So this is going to be a Java string file manager, which a computer which is a computer program, of

60
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:16,040
course, and that will be providing us an interface, basically a disk window interface to manage our

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,260
files and folders inside our system.

62
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,950
Of course.

63
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:26,030
And the most common operations we are going to perform with the help of this file browser is to create

64
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,240
folders with the help of this, create new files inside the folders.

65
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:40,040
We can rename a folder, we can save a file folder and also the other functionalities which we are adding

66
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,580
to this.

67
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,840
Suppose we want to see our image like open image file.

68
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Then we can click on this image file and that image will open in the IT application window itself.

69
00:05:52,310 --> 00:06:00,950
Also, there is an option attached in this application that suppose we want to like watch any file or

70
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,660
folder in our desktop.

71
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:09,800
So that is a like a pop up menu which is a padding and which will contain option that suppose if we

72
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,730
want to open that index.html, then we can also open that in our desktop.

73
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:25,220
So that will open like a basic our system's window and we'll exit this window of this Java project interface.

74
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,820
So the other features of this project are that we can create, append, rename, copy and everything

75
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,980
with all the files and folders.

76
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:40,100
So basically we can modify the file attributes, property and file permissions.

77
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:47,150
Files and folders may be displayed in a hierarchical tree based on that directory structure, which

78
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:54,200
we have already discussed, that this is following a tree like data structure which is like you can

79
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,840
see that it is opening in a hierarchical manner.

80
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:04,940
These keys are attaching like a which tree is linked to which child and which is the parent and which

81
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,720
is the child.

82
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:14,750
So also we are going to learn how this hierarchical data structure linking and everything well now coming

83
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,180
to the concepts which we are going to learn after the completion of this project.

84
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,760
So this project is made with the help of object oriented programming concept.

85
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,160
So we will be using objects.

86
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:35,090
We all know that objects are real world entities and we are going to like tackle the real world entities.

87
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,710
With the help of this project.

88
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,330
Basically there is no hypothetical object.

89
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,930
We are going to use hypothetical term or we can say that entity which we are going to, or there will

90
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,540
be everything which will be a real world entity.

91
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,590
So object oriented programming goes perfect for that.

92
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:03,110
Now we are going to also learn that we are going to use String and NWT in extensive manner, so we will

93
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,740
be using components inside these libraries or packages.

94
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,520
We can see that the component is not the key is not the mouse adapter, but for the image and buffer

95
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,920
right there.

96
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:21,020
So we are using the images for this like that is image for this folder.

97
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,090
So we are like embedding these images inside this application.

98
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:32,600
Also there are image files which we are opening in the application.

99
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:40,210
So everything is rendered inside the window with the help of Buffer, the image and Beaufort writer

100
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,380
and also a file reader.

101
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,590
So this is also an interesting feature of this application that we can read and modify.

102
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,100
Files.

103
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:56,450
Suppose there is a text file we want to like modify that file so we can suppose we want to remove some

104
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,570
text or add some text to that file.

105
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,250
Then we can do so and we can save that changer and everything will be made very conveniently without

106
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,340
any mess and there will be no time lost at all.

107
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,390
Basically, this will work as a normal notepad or this file reader which is opening inside this application

108
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,450
only is going to be like a normal text editor.

109
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:28,070
So we are attaching a text editor also inside this application where we can do that right inside the

110
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,460
file.

111
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:34,460
So yes, we then write features are also embedded inside this project interface.

112
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,920
Also we are going to learn a hierarchy tree based structure on the directory structure.

113
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,930
So we will be learning that how we can link the folders and the subfolders in a form of a tree like

114
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,550
it should be looking like.

115
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,440
The hierarchy includes a folder, a subfolder.

116
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,410
Inside the subfolder there may be folders and files.

117
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,690
So everything is going to be combined in the form of a tree that will be parent.

118
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,710
That will be child.

119
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,600
There will be child to that chair.

120
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,790
So everything is going to be like attached to each other in the form of a tree.

121
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:17,110
Also, we are going to learn that how to make a Java application from scratch, like we will be creating

122
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,930
a new project in the compiler.

123
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,230
Then inside the ID window we will create the project.

124
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,490
We will attach files which will be containing the classes.

125
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,530
There will be classes for suppose we want to save a folder.

126
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,330
We want to like read the file, write a file.

127
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,850
We will be attaching action list notes.

128
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,790
Also there is a scroll pane.

129
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,110
Also you can see that.

130
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,950
So there will be functionalities for all of them, whether it be for opening the file, reading the

131
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,250
file, writing the file or saving the file.

132
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,300
Of course, whether we want to rename a file and also creating new files.

133
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:06,110
So yes, we will be using the repaint and revalidate components of Java.

134
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,120
Basically they are going to modify the structure.

135
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:19,320
Suppose we have added a new file, so that feature is going to be more like the revamp or the tree structure.

136
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,070
So suppose they have added a subfolder here inside the DX drive.

137
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:30,700
So this tree on a tree like structure of this local disk B will be revamped.

138
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:37,980
Yes, a new child will be added to this parent or the hierarchical structure will totally update.

139
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:45,370
So all this updating and revamping is done with the help of repaint and revalidate features.

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,290
There are mouse motion listeners, so suppose we have like a right click on any folder, then our pop

141
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,570
up menu is appearing.

142
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,520
Also, we are going to handle the pop up menu bar.

143
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:05,950
Like there will be separate functionalities for pop ups and like options inside the pop up, whether

144
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:13,660
it was the okay button, we have encountered it here and yes, there is like options for saving a new

145
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,380
folder.

146
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,110
Also, if we are creating a new file, it is going to be saved in the form of a text format.

147
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:28,600
So we are making sure with the help of this pop up that that new file is created with a dot text extension.

148
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,200
We will be like encountering that how actually these things are working in the working of the project

149
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,640
part, which will be which we will be seeing in the next part only just the immediate next part also.

150
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:50,620
So I think you have like gained a rough idea about what this application is about, how it is going

151
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,250
to look.

152
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,620
That is a background image in the so basically there are two divisions are left and right.

153
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,760
This is a shop in this is the main window which is containing the folders also inside the bottom like

154
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,410
we can see that a footer is containing the count for the folders.

155
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,740
Here we are having 31 elements, so it is changing.

156
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,700
So basically a counter is also attached here which is going to count the number of the folders where

157
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,660
we can say that child is inside the hierarchy.

158
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,720
So this was all about this application.

159
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,400
There are various concepts which we are going to learn and also at the end of this project we will have

160
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:42,580
a wonderful file browser of Java which will be like made on our own and we will definitely enjoy this

161
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,080
project experience.

162
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,920
So.

163
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,900
Or let this move forward.

164
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:55,580
Understand the working of this application and make a rough prototype of what actually the pathway we

165
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:01,410
want to follow in order to make this application totally functioning.

166
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,640
So in the next part, we will be covering both of them.

167
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:12,860
The working of this application, that experience with the user is going to get and to design a pathway

168
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,500
of how we are going to make this application.

169
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,660
So see you in the next part.
