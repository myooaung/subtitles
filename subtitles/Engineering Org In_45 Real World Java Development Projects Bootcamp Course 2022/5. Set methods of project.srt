1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,700
So all of you already know that we created three methods here.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,670
Password change password method generating random password method.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:20,300
Also I created here using that password method using random also then asking for department and printing

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,750
the mill.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,030
Now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to set that mailbox capacity.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,140
Now, remember in this first also I told by default is 500.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,510
And but if users want to extend that mailbox capacity, I'm asking for the set mailbox capacity method.

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,300
So after this part, I will create some.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,550
Set.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,720
Mailbox capacity.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,460
Method.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,990
Mailbox capacity.

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,460
Method.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,080
Then again, it is public, as I told you.

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,640
Why should it really be public?

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,590
Because user want to access that part will sit.

17
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,910
Male kept.

18
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,250
That's it.

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,430
Then no need to put any argument here because I don't want to put here.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,020
If you want, you can minimize this part.

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,680
Also see steam dot, dot, println.

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,700
Current capacity will bring current capacity first.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,610
Current capacity.

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,950
Is equal to.

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,580
Let's this dot.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,530
Male capacity.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,810
And I'm considering this is costing me not in GB, so I know this is very less, but I want to clearly

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,390
simplify this in my only.

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,030
Then system got out.

30
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,990
Println.

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,620
There is no need to ask for what is your first capacity or something?

32
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,670
I just want to create or assign that.

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,410
So enter new capacity.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,260
Under new mailbox capacity.

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,110
Capacity.

36
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,000
Then.

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,630
This not male capacity, that part only.

38
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,570
Is equal to as dot next.

39
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,440
Next integer only.

40
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,120
No need to put anything here next to it.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,290
And it will change like system dot.

42
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,220
Oh, dark.

43
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,420
In Berlin.

44
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,750
Mailbox capacity.

45
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,150
He is successfully changed.

46
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,950
So this is all about Ken setting the mailbox over city.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,080
It is very easy.

48
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,090
Printing first current capacity.

49
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,310
Then enter the new mailbox capacity.

50
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,050
And just from the user just assigned to that new mailbox capacity.

51
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,340
Similarly for that.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,800
Alternate meal, public void.

53
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,760
What is that alternate?

54
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,070
Eamon.

55
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,010
So I will put here first.

56
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,060
Set.

57
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,080
Our Internet.

58
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:42,850
We to remember comments because it's very helpful while reading the code system dot.

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
Oh, Lord.

60
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,240
Brent Lynn.

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,390
Enter.

62
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
New Order.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,800
Net mail or email.

64
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,550
Then this dot alternative bill that we create already created that part is not.

65
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,050
Mixed.

66
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,420
Then system.

67
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,040
This is very simple material.

68
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,800
No need to worry about this.

69
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,260
Alternate.

70
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,920
Male or female.

71
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,100
Is sick.

72
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,390
That's it.

73
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:31,980
Now these are all about creating or generating something, but I want to create some another method

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,070
to display something because we are just generating.

75
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:41,550
But there is nothing I'm going to display here how I can display the user information or something,

76
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,320
that part.

77
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,240
So to display user information I will create.

78
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,160
Another method.

79
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,290
Information matter.

80
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,580
For that part, it should be public, only public.

81
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,520
Avoid getting info and printing gear to get info.

82
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,900
Simple.

83
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,860
Just printing nothing.

84
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,980
Well that system dot dot printer and just printing statement print statements are only.

85
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,800
This dot.

86
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,100
F.M. now the space between to these.

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,420
This dot.

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,160
Similarly that system.

89
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,280
Port au Prince in.

90
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,840
Depart.

91
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,750
Meant.

92
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,560
Plus it will put that department, this DOD.

93
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,130
Liberty.

94
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,670
Department.

95
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,890
This is then for email you can put.

96
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,650
Email.

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,530
Then.

98
00:05:59,340 --> 00:05:59,970
This.

99
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,460
But.

100
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,210
All the user information, basically.

101
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,190
Then if you want to put a password, you can put that password.

102
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:19,220
But here y in ideal condition you should not print any password or you should not display any password,

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,090
but for the significant convenience and I want to check it will be running or not I'm going to put here

104
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,480
on you.

105
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,020
So this is for the testing purpose for our application.

106
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,120
This is not password.

107
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,540
Then again, system dot dot println.

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,030
Mail box capacity.

109
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,010
This not mailbox mail capacity.

110
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,320
I put the mail capacity.

111
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:04,220
And I will put in the also like I'm already mentioned I'm putting in this only me.

112
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,340
Then again, system dot dot println.

113
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,110
I don't make.

114
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,570
Internet.

115
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,000
Male.

116
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,450
This.

117
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,030
Not.

118
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,750
Alter email and that's it.

119
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:44,080
We we're done with these matters, so let's invoke it into that public class.

120
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:51,070
But before that, remember, we are remaining with some other methods, also store files and this.

121
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,630
But before that I will explain that constructor.

122
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:00,470
But yeah, so we already created one constructor here and before that creating controller.

123
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,540
What I did is set mailbox capacity, then set change password method, alternate email method and display

124
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,390
user information method that should be done.

125
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,640
Then we want to call that methods.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,470
So calling that method is very simple here, I can say.

127
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,240
So now I will go to this constructive part here.

128
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,260
Now.

129
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,350
I am putting here is calling.

130
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,590
Methods.

131
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,240
So now quality methods is very simple.

132
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,350
This lot.

133
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,620
Department to assign that department.

134
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,020
This DOD department is equal to this DOD set department.

135
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,350
What?

136
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,940
I created the said department.

137
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,530
Now the for the random password.

138
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,570
I will put here for department.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,220
First random password.

140
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:04,940
This for password is equal to this load generate password which I created.

141
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,830
Now what required here is I'm putting length eight.

142
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,310
What I told you.

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,170
I'm not mentioning Len there because I want to put inside this.

144
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,000
So avoiding that part, I just put length here.

145
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,550
So Len will be always it.

146
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,480
It's not very ideal condition to put always Len eight but for the simple condition, I use your eight

147
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,270
or you can put as much you want or you can choose form 6 to 15 or something like that.

148
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,710
Now.

149
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,100
I want to combine this.

150
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,210
Like generating mail.

151
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,340
You know that method this lot.

152
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,420
What is that?

153
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,250
Generate email.

154
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,400
Email.

155
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,600
This is for.

156
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,030
Email generation.

157
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,740
No.

158
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,360
Now we are done with this part.

159
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,120
But.

160
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,900
This is just there is no matter.

161
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:13,740
You cannot run this like this only because you can see there is no main method we created here we are

162
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,090
remaining with main method.

163
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,000
So this is all about the email part.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,410
In the next part, what I'm going to show you how we can create main method.

165
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:29,600
We are going to invoke that main method, including that how we can use this all part.

166
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:38,880
Plus, I'm going to show you how you can create and store that in the specific file dot text file.
