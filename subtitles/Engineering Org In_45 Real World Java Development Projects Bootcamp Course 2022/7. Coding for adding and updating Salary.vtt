00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.780
So in this video we will be talking about the next two classes salary on Java and update salary on Java.

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.780
So salary class will be used to set the salary or pay the salary to the employee and update salary or

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.470
Java class will be used to update the salary of any particular employee.

4
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.800
So let's have a look at the salary file.

5
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.980
So inside which we have imported the package, our SQL district to connect with the database Java X

6
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.640
dot swing to create a better graphical user interface.

7
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.400
Java JWT to create a.

8
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.500
Graphical user interface with the help of the classes and methods provided by the Abstract Window Toolkit

9
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.650
and Ada Blue Dot event, which will be used to handle events or the buttons.

10
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.640
Then what we are doing is defining a public class salary, which is extending the frame and implementing

11
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.250
actions inside which we have defined.

12
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.120
J label.

13
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.930
There are seven labels, seven text field, two buttons, and one choice and stance.

14
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.090
Now inside the salary non parameterized constructor salary.

15
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.990
What we are doing doing is.

16
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.600
Hiding assets salary.

17
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.100
After that, we have set the layout of the window with the help of new grid layout.

18
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.780
Eight comma two comma 20 common 20 and define the status was two new choice now to add choices over

19
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.020
the instance of the C2 inside the tri block we have initialize the connection with our database.

20
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.280
Con C is equals to new con, which will this class we have created in our earlier videos.

21
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.160
After that result, set addresses equals to see one point as a dot execute query pass the argument test

22
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.740
select district from employee.

23
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.060
So this result that will install all the details of the employee for from our employee table of the

24
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.120
database and while our start next.

25
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.070
So this will iterate over all the records of the table employ.

26
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.130
We will be adding all the IDs for every employer in our choice.

27
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.550
The cast block will handle any exception if occurs.

28
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.840
Then what we are doing is adding a label select employee number and after that we are adding the C2

29
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.580
choice in our char frame.

30
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.140
Then we have defined the label named as HRA.

31
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.680
After that, we have defined the text field.

32
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.290
With size 15 and adding the label and text field to over.

33
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.880
Frame after that.

34
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.960
What we are doing is.

35
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.420
Defining another label L three new label label.

36
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:56.230
SD Then we have defined the text field with the maximum files 15 to enter that D adding the L 393 both

37
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.820
to our j frame.

38
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.920
After that, we have defined under another label as m d and defining a D for new text field maximum

39
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.800
size 15 and adding the L four and D four to our.

40
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.750
J frame.

41
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.850
After that there is a label l five labeled as F and.

42
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.740
D5, which is labelled as text field, which is a text field and its maximum size is 15, adding that

43
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.680
L five and T five both to our frame.

44
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.280
After that, what we are doing is there is a label six name named as basic salary, defining a text

45
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.190
field for that respective basic salary to enter the salary.

46
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.570
Then we are adding the L six and six both to our G frame.

47
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.840
Then we have defined a button women as equals to a new button which is labelled as submit its background

48
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.080
colour as black and its foreground colour as white.

49
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.640
The submit button will be used to submit the details of the salary into our table of the database.

50
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.950
Then we have defined the cancel button which will be used to cancel or close the output or window of

51
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.790
this class.

52
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.770
Beethoven set background colour as black and foreground colour as white.

53
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.200
Adding that b one button and B two button to our.

54
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.020
Classes.

55
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.750
So we have added B1, B2, but then to our frame.

56
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.550
And after that what we are doing is adding action listener to both the B1 and B two buttons, because

57
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:43.880
these buttons must be performing any event and after that, setting the size as 450 plus 550 and set

58
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.160
the location as 500, comma 200.

59
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.060
Set the visibility of the window as true.

60
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.610
After that, setting the background color as white.

61
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.460
Now public white action performed inside the action from the event method.

62
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.780
We are taking argument as action event a what we are doing inside this method is.

63
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.350
Inside the string array, we are restoring the content from the text field.

64
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.690
Even inside the string ID we are installing the choice which will be selected from the key to.

65
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.020
Inside the DVR is storing the text or content from the text field.

66
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.540
Three.

67
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:29.570
Then inside the string, we are installing the text field value of default inside the PFA, restoring

68
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.380
the content of the TX five and inside the string basic.

69
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.020
We are restoring the text field content of 36.

70
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.320
Then we have defined a string query.

71
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.370
Q are y inside which we have passed the argument insert into salary values.

72
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.400
Which will help us to install the values into our salary table of the database.

73
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:57.000
And inside the bracket, we have passed those values ID grade and midpoint basic.

74
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.430
Now inside the trialogue, what we did is we have created a connection instance of our database class,

75
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.170
which is common and c 1.. executable query inside which we are past.

76
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:19.140
The Q are Y so that the query this query can be executed successfully with C one point has to execute

77
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.250
update query.

78
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.270
Then there is a j option pane dot show message dialog box which will show the dialog box says salary

79
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.990
updated.

80
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.050
If the query has been updated successfully, then we will set the visibility of the current window as

81
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.240
false and catch the exception if any occurs.

82
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.930
Inside the public static void main method.

83
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.240
We have just created the instance of the salary.

84
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.060
So this is how we can add details to our salary table for that particular employee.

85
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:55.600
Now let's have a look at how we can update salary of any employee so far that we have created a class

86
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.800
update salary.

87
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.500
So let's have a look at this now.

88
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.730
So inside the update salary, we have imported JavaScript strict because we need to retrieve the information

89
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.720
from the database and also update the information in the database.

90
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.020
So this package will help us to connect with our database.

91
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.660
Java Exports trying to provide a better info interface and graphical user interface for the application.

92
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.720
A JWT event to handle events over the buttons.

93
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:31.340
Now this public class updates which is extending frame and implementing action listener and both item

94
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.880
listener.

95
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:38.900
There will be six labels, six text fields, two buttons and one choice inside the non parameterized

96
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.610
constructor of that update salary.

97
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.970
What we are doing is setting the layout as null, using no layout.

98
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.520
See how it is equal to new choice and to a store ID of the employer and see out.

99
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:56.180
We have created a connection of our database instance and then we are creating instance of a result

100
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.680
set and executing the query select as strict from salary and from the salary table.

101
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.630
What we are doing is we are adding every idea of the employer to our choice.

102
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.510
Instance, the cash block will handle any exception.

103
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.560
Then we have defined the label select employee.

104
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.190
Named as select shampoo and set its bound 20 comma 2000 cross 20.

105
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.970
Adding that label to our frame.

106
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.350
After that, we have defined the bound for our choice and stance, adding that to our frame.

107
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.950
Also.

108
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.220
Then there is a label HRA and the text field for that.

109
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:40.300
Variable HIV label and we have set the bound for both 11 and L two to set its policy position and respective

110
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.270
size, adding that 1191 to our frame.

111
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.850
After that, what we are doing, we are creating a label for the day and its respective text field,

112
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.420
setting the bound for both of the label and the text field.

113
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.190
After that, we are adding the label L 22 to our frame.

114
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.020
After that, we are defining a label for the MIDI and its respective text field.

115
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.620
Three.

116
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:09.220
Then we set the bound location and size for both labels and text field respectively, then adding that

117
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.320
label and text field to our frame.

118
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:19.750
After that we are adding a label, new label and inside the T for text field what we are doing is J

119
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:20.850
text field 15.

120
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:27.210
So we are maximizing maximum size for the text field is 15 and that's for the label.

121
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:32.070
And after that we are setting the size and location for that for 94 respectively.

122
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.300
Then we are adding that Alpha 24 to our J frame.

123
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.160
After that there is another label.

124
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:45.000
As for the basic salary and respect to text field SD five, maximum size 15 and then setting the size

125
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.420
and location for that alpha 75, then adding both the labels and text field to our J frame.

126
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.680
After that, there are two buttons.

127
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.570
One is goes to new button update.

128
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.600
Set background as black or foreground as white.

129
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:08.030
This will be used to update the details of the employee salary and then there is a B to button new button

130
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.550
delete and B to set background as color black and set foreground color as white.

131
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:19.430
This will be used to delete any record for that particular ID of the employee beyond set down, which

132
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.290
will set the location for that particular button and b to set bond, which will set the location and

133
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.610
size for that particular button which is referencing to the delete.

134
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.950
Adding both the buttons to frame now adding action, listening to our button B one and B two and item

135
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:43.100
listener in our choice see to background color of the whole window as white setting visibility as true

136
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.220
sizes four and across 450 and location as 600.

137
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.090
Comma 200.

138
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.540
Now inside the action performed method, which is taking an action event argument.

139
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:59.140
What we are doing is if the source from the B1 button is if the source of the event is from the B1 button.

140
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:08.100
We will explore the content of the text filled one in a selected item or from the citizen ID and the

141
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:14.460
selected content from the data in the content of T three in the content of RT for NPF and content of

142
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.490
t five in basically a string.

143
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.680
Now after that a string Q or VI.

144
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.450
What we are doing in a string Q are why?

145
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:29.760
We are creating the update query so that the details of the salary for that particular employee ID can

146
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.480
be updated.

147
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:37.290
It is stating that update salary is attached to the Met basic salary where it will be the selected item.

148
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.810
Now inside the trialogue, what we are doing is creating the connection with our database with the help

149
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.310
of our class execute query.

150
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:51.960
If the query has been updated successfully, we will be showing the dialog box that salary updated and

151
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.000
set the availability of the current window as false.

152
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.430
Cache block will handle any exception if occurs.

153
00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.680
Now, if the source of the button is from the B2, which will be deleted.

154
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.300
So we have to delete that particular record.

155
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:11.100
So inside the block we have again created the connection with the database class which is gone and 7..

156
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.350
execute update instead which we have passed delete from salary where the it will be to get selected

157
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.740
item.

158
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.130
So for that particular ID, the complete record will be deleted.

159
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.780
It will show that salary deleted and setup ability of the current window as false.

160
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.640
Catalog will handle any exceptional effects.

161
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.390
Now, inside, the item is changed.

162
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.110
We'll pass the item inventory and inside the block.
