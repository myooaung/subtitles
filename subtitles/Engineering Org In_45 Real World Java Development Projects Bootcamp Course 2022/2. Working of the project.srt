00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,790
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:09,900
So I hope that you all have went through the introduction part pretty well and have again like much

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,980
idea about what actually this project is about, what are the functionalities we are going to attach

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,360
in this project and what are the concepts we are going to learn after the successful completion of this

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,990
project?

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:32,610
So after getting through the rough idea about this project, we are here to check the working of this

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,140
project, how actually this project works, what are the options?

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,690
How choosing options, navigating between accounts and everything works.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,080
So in this part we are here.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,510
After running the program, we are going to write the program on our own.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:59,670
But I am here to explain this with my already written program and to like check everything is working

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,920
perfectly or not.

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,930
So on running this project, this welcome to the project message will be displayed on your screens and

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,250
again asking for that type of account like we, whether we are existing users, then we will have to

15
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,770
log in and if we are like new user, then we have to create a new account to this project.

16
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:34,140
So suppose we are a new user and we want to create a new account, so we will be hitting two options

17
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,730
from our keyboard and on hitting enter we will be asked for enter your customer number.

18
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,860
So this is upon us.

19
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,570
We can choose any number.

20
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:54,420
So suppose I am choosing like four times nine as my customer number and and terrapin to be registered.

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,640
I told you about that.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,740
These credentials are very like explore visible.

23
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,660
Yes, they are possible.

24
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:12,900
So we have to keep these credentials very secure and do not disclose this information to anybody asking

25
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:23,150
for it as this is about the security of our money and this has to be kept in mind that we do not like

26
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:30,030
share these credentials to any random person which we are not knowing well.

27
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:39,150
So yes, after hitting enter yes your new account has been created, successfully registered.

28
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:47,010
So this message will appear on your window and then you will be redirected to the login window.

29
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:55,470
So if we have a pressed one in the choice option, so automatically this will be a padding.

30
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,500
But we have chosen the create account option.

31
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,850
So this is the additional part which will be asked by the user that you have to register first, then

32
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,530
only you can enter to this item like system.

33
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:20,550
So we are like we are having our customer number and pin number already so we can like see them and

34
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,090
type.

35
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,660
But I have told you that you have to remember this in future if you want to log in again.

36
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:34,950
So enter your customer number and enter your PIN number has been entered successfully.

37
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,170
Now after this, we are logged into our ATM system.

38
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,540
Now we have to select the type of account you like we want to access.

39
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,190
So type one is the checking account and type two is the savings account.

40
00:03:50,190 --> 00:04:00,330
So suppose we want to enter in our savings account and hitting to and after this this savings account

41
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,950
interface will open.

42
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,370
So suppose you want to view the balance.

43
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,040
So initially our balance is zero.

44
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:14,280
We have nothing in our savings account balance, so we want to deposit some money.

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,130
So current savings account balance will be displayed at every step.

46
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,290
We have already discussed it.

47
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,390
So amount you want to deposit.

48
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,730
So suppose I want to deposit $20,000 to my savings account.

49
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,610
So current savings account balance will reflect our value of $20,000.

50
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,750
Now, in the next step, if you will be like viewing balance, then the balance will be updated.

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,810
Now the next step we want to perform is suppose we want to withdraw some money.

52
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,010
So on hitting do it will be asking for amount.

53
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,240
We want to withdraw.

54
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,870
So suppose I want to withdraw to $2,000.

55
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,440
Yes.

56
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:07,130
So once I withdraw $2,000, then the current savings account balance will be updated to $18,000, which

57
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,420
is like working pretty fine.

58
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,910
We have like withdrawn 2000 automatically.

59
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,310
20,000 -2000 is $18,000.

60
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,950
Now, the most interesting feature is like transferring funds within the account.

61
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,020
So let us check that function also.

62
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,460
So select an account you want to transfer the funds to.

63
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,870
So you want to transfer funds to our checking account as we have like nothing in our checking account.

64
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,460
So amount you want to deposit.

65
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:50,690
Suppose we have $18,000 and we want to deposit it to our checking account balance from our savings account.

66
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,330
So the current savings account balance will be 10,000.

67
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:07,360
Now, after this, we want to exit this frame and we want to enter in that checking account window.

68
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,290
Now, in the checking account interface, suppose we want to view the balance.

69
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:21,260
So our checking account balance is updated to 8000 as we have transferred funds from the savings account

70
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,420
to the checking account balance.

71
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:30,230
Now here also we can transfer the funds to the checking account savings account balance from this checking

72
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,460
account balance.

73
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,700
So suppose we are transferring 2000.

74
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,960
Okay.

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,940
So you want to transfer funds to a savings account and 2000 or so checking account balance updated.

76
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,740
Now let us check whether the savings account balance is updated or not.

77
00:06:50,040 --> 00:07:00,090
So what we had, we had I think the savings account balance was at the last step, 12,000.

78
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,890
Yes, I can see that we have 1000.

79
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,690
So on hitting one.

80
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:13,100
Yes, perfect savings account balance is to end $12,000, which is like working perfectly fine.

81
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,120
We are like done with all the functionalities checked.

82
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,030
We have checked that.

83
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,600
Yes, the logging and registering thing.

84
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:32,120
Now, after that, we logged in to our ATM system, after which we have entered the savings account

85
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,070
interface.

86
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,910
Now did some functionalities inside the savings account interface, like depositing funds, withdrawing

87
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:47,670
funds, viewing balance, and then at last transferring funds to our checking accounts.

88
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:53,420
So after which we have like navigated to our checking account.

89
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:01,280
And again, we checked the balance, we transferred the funds again from the checking account interface

90
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,900
to the savings account.

91
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,730
So everything till now is working perfectly fine.

92
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:17,120
So this is an interesting project in Java where we are like switching between options.

93
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,520
We have this code which reflects object oriented programming.

94
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,170
We are having objects, classes, and inside the classes everything is like taking place.

95
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,640
All these steps are maintained by separate classes.

96
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:44,360
So like let us firstly prepare a rough prototype of what actually we are going to do inside this programming

97
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,630
section, which we will be looking in the next part.

98
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:58,130
So firstly, we have to create a new project in the ID, and after the successful creation of the new

99
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:08,390
project, we will be creating a main class which will be responsible for like our testing and running

100
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,820
of the IT management system or testing and running.

101
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,320
Testing and running is only performed by this main class.

102
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:27,560
No other classes will be involved in testing and running of the like system, only this main class.

103
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,880
So initially we will create a main class.

104
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:39,950
Then after that, what are the other classes we will require in order to complete this system project?

105
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:54,050
So the second class will be a account class creating the account class, and this class will be like

106
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,720
managing everything about the type of account

107
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:11,450
customer verification thing, like whether the credentials entered by the customer is like correct or

108
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:11,970
not.

109
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:22,790
So we have to like have a two factor authentication thing to check that whether the PIN and the customer

110
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,840
number entered by the customer is correct or not.

111
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:33,950
So we will be like managing our functionality for that verification in our account class in the project.

112
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,200
Now the third thing we will be going to manage inside this account class will be like operations regarding

113
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,260
the balance calculations.

114
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:53,030
So operations regarding balance calculation will be also managed by this account, class only.

115
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,640
So yes, this is the third thing we are going to manage inside this.

116
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:08,600
Now suppose that if a user enters any wrong choice from like their keyboards or wrong option is selected.

117
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:19,820
So also there is an exception checking like exception handling method for invalid choices which we are

118
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,570
going to manage with the help of try and catch blocks.

119
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:32,540
So yes, this exception handling will be performed with this account class for invalid choices also.

120
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,730
So this is all about this account class we are going to create.

121
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,910
Now, the fourth thing yes, the third class we will be creating.

122
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:52,490
And the fourth thing which we are keeping in mind in the prototype section, is to create creating an

123
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,260
option class.

124
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:04,460
So option menu class we can see and this option menu class will be responsible for displaying the options

125
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,400
list like displaying the.

126
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,300
List of choices.

127
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:20,780
Yes, this is the right word list of choices from which the user has to select that what he actually

128
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,100
wants to do.

129
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,480
Then you want to log in or create an account.

130
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:32,180
Then after that, whether he wants to enter to the checking account interface or the savings account

131
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,590
interface and everything.

132
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:45,200
So yes, this is option menu class and displaying list of choices is the role of this option menu class.

133
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:55,730
And the rules are to handle the exceptions, to handle the exceptions regarding the like option selection.

134
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:05,960
But suppose that the option attached to a specific choice is not entered correctly then to handle the

135
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,820
exceptions regarding the.

136
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,230
Yes.

137
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,830
So handle the exceptions here.

138
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,140
Exceptions regarding the switch cases.

139
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,920
So what actually switch cases are?

140
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,770
We will be like discussing it in detail in the programming section.

141
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:34,380
So yes, exceptions regarding the switch cases will be handled inside this option menu class.

142
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:44,240
And at last, this option menu class will be mapping things like we have a choice and a special option

143
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,370
attached to that choice.

144
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,950
So that is a unique choice with every key press.

145
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,820
So with the help of mapping, we are going to perform this.

146
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,170
Yes, here me correctly, I am talking about mapping.

147
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:08,870
We are going to use hash maps, data structures in order to link choices to specific options so that

148
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,780
on pressing that specific key, that specific option is to be performed.

149
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:30,590
So this option menu class will be going to like responsible about mapping values or with every key press.

150
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,060
Yes.

151
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,720
So we are going to map everything.

152
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:43,160
Every key should be mapped to a specific option and everything is going to be like linked in a manner

153
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,410
so that nothing overlaps.

154
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:54,050
Like suppose you press key file for the extracting and that key on pressing that key you enter to transfer

155
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,030
funds interface.

156
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,080
So this is not going to work.

157
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:06,710
We have to map everything like correctly in order to make things properly functional without any overlapping.

158
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:16,520
So to avoid any kind of exceptions overlapping, we are going to use different types of data structures

159
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,290
which we will be looking in the programming section in the next part.

160
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:27,620
So I hope you have understood all the like blueprint part of this project.

161
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:34,370
Now from the next part we will be start creating a new project and then initializing all the classes

162
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,130
and functionalities related to them.

163
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,850
So see you in the next part with the coding section.
