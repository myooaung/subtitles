1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,970
If you are so take it strong.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,390
You are simply.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,620
And you are simply copying this.

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,060
Just beat this line and don't.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,260
So we have.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,090
Take this.

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,860
You are in.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,820
And now we have.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,090
Get the Yahoo!

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,470
String results.

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,750
So.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,790
Right.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,820
Try and take the string results here.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,670
MP

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,860
you are in.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,280
Mehmet Oz took the page on the New York.

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,730
Do you want to?

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,670
PWD.

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,260
This is done.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,960
Now we need a buffer reader.

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,210
Florida in New we need Florida's.

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,940
And give it a new

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,530
input string reader, this one.

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:59,850
And after this, rewrite the page, not stream this one.

25
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,650
So we import this also.

26
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,650
Okay.

27
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,950
We will create a class first.

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,260
Okay.

29
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:23,250
So basically we have the page as the input stream and we do a new input stream on it and the new and

30
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,970
restore it.

31
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,730
And basically the operator that we have done.

32
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,350
So what we do now, we have this stream for the input line.

33
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,580
So let's take the stream input.

34
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,060
Nine.

35
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,200
Right?

36
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,890
Right.

37
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,750
What line?

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,360
It grew in the heart.

39
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,600
Read line.

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,230
Snotty girl, too, to no.

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,500
You know.

42
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,430
We strong?

43
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,660
So here's one thing.

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,820
We need bodies.

45
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:39,450
Who will do results equal to results?

46
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,390
You could line.

47
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,220
This.

48
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,220
So we have all these other here.

49
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,410
So let's just include all the files that we actually need.

50
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,690
The first of all, we need to issue.

51
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:31,270
So here we have the Java material and another one which we need to read.

52
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,090
Here we will write import java load.

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,880
You.

54
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,890
Both Foot reader,

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,190
rehab and stream reader also.

56
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,080
We have the you ought to be kind of a reader.

57
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,190
We need the sync results,

58
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,600
so we will write our note.

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,670
Swing.

60
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,440
Start on.

61
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,090
So we will set this thing.

62
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,930
And then don't need me have power, don't you?

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,060
Lord rejects.

64
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,100
We need a pattern.

65
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:48,680
We have the pattern also, and we need a method to write down.

66
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,690
You do not write checks?

67
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,380
Not.

68
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,910
Mature

69
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,400
this mature.

70
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,390
Okay.

71
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,460
We have all these.

72
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,870
No.

73
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,570
I don't know.

74
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,650
Maybe assuming that probably we just have to do it.

75
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,040
Okay, so

76
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,100
we do the last.

77
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,010
The mind of a reader.

78
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,320
I'll.

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,830
Ki.

80
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,530
So you.

81
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,690
Keynesian is incompatible types.

82
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:14,830
So we will firstly close the puffer reader first so we don't lose and we need a catch.

83
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,180
It's already here.

84
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,380
So after this.

85
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,410
We have to handle the other also.

86
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,120
So basically we will write.

87
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,100
Except she.

88
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,480
So who'd.

89
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,480
So to society.

90
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,680
This is what we need.

91
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,780
Okay.

92
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,000
Move used.

93
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
It's done.

94
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,840
No.

95
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,640
We have to write attachment here.

96
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,590
So we will write

97
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,360
children being not sure.

98
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,780
Message dialogue.

99
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,780
So here we will write this.

100
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,860
After this, we will give a message.

101
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:57,560
Disable write disable to connect to your we will try disable to connect to Yahoo!

102
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:08,800
This thing is done and here we have the error handling part also.

103
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,510
So.

104
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,620
We have got the results, so we have to get the results.

105
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,460
We need a pattern matching here.

106
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,400
So we write pattern finding pattern.

107
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,270
Equal to pattern, not compile.

108
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:43,860
Okay.

109
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,890
So.

110
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:55,230
To say, let's exhale after this.

111
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,820
We need I have already righted this.

112
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:08,220
This will be the read this one to simply write and paste.

113
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,470
It will going to match the actual text that we're going to read.

114
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,840
So let's roll it in number.

115
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,270
So it's going to be 0 to 9 here.

116
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,570
This one could be more than one number.

117
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,940
And also, it might be a decimal.

118
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,070
So we have the thought as well.

119
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,680
This is going to match the pattern that the user gave.

120
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,480
So for this, we need much, much find.

121
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,760
Final button, no matter.

122
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,450
I mean, right

123
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,040
now we have to match.

124
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,870
Find you and you.

125
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,590
We need.

126
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,520
The Sun.

127
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

128
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,270
So here.

129
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,040
No, the matching.

130
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,420
The pattern is matched.

131
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,290
So now we have to match fine.

132
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,860
And we have to execute the regular expression.

133
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:49,060
So we are going to spread the currency first.

134
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,950
We need to match.

135
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,760
Find.

136
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,480
No, it's fine.

137
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:09,660
So we take the well and we write our rate equal to double, not value of.

138
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:17,110
We actually want to do the thing from the match find here.

139
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,220
So we will.

140
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,340
Right, match.

141
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,870
Fine.

142
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,600
So do the group first.

143
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,580
So we write group and I know that will value.

144
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,220
This is how the conversion rate on.

145
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,710
Growth rate.

146
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,450
From Groupon.

147
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,550
Okay.

148
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,510
Now.

149
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,950
We need to get in the middle of this one so we will write.

150
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:27,850
We need to learn to convert and we will write our rate multiplied

151
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,490
the

152
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,010
value of here.

153
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:46,660
We will write a good amount here and start.

154
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,310
You get taxed.

155
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,970
Okay.

156
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,020
We will change the variable name.

157
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,320
Okay.

158
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:17,430
Currency amount will need a currency amount not get taxed.

159
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,940
And.

160
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,080
Not.

161
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,060
We value.

162
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,220
Who do?

163
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,360
Mr..

164
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,540
And.

165
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,540
The normal value of my point.

166
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,460
So here.

167
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,040
Done.

168
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,360
This is done.

169
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,790
So now we have converted.

170
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:06,940
We we actually have the value to conversion everything we need to get the current rate and amount.

171
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,600
So we have to create time matching also.

172
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,950
So, so just copy this and.

173
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,370
Here.

174
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,940
We will know we need.

175
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,030
This one.

176
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,730
You even tried.

177
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,150
Final Brighton.

178
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,640
This should be removed.

179
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,180
And then here we will write.

180
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,490
This one.

181
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,790
Simply copy and paste this.

182
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,750
Now we are going to take anything, the Spaniard, if you like it.

183
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,590
So it's going to have it's going to be this type.

184
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,660
This will at first underscore it.

185
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,240
And this can be any number of letter equal to X.

186
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,600
So that will be the actual pattern of that we need to match.

187
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,430
So.

188
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,480
We have this much fun.

189
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,960
Thing is, we need

190
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,160
to display that text.
