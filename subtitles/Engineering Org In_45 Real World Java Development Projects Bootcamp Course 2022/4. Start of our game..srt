1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,740
So here I have a game labeled and a colon.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,260
So what I have done with this, I have labeled this file loop game.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:18,740
So game is now the name of this wallet and now we are going to be using this label here a bit later

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,130
letter so that we can allow our program to trade back to the start of this world loop or here.

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,460
That's why we need this label right here.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,810
So now that we have done that, there's going to be a lot of systems around that line in this program.

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:45,000
So right here, just because it is a text based game, so it has to be a lot of text printed out on

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,870
the screen.

9
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,080
So I'm going to go ahead and firstly, I will write here.

10
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,130
Okay.

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,800
I will copy the system out of print.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,960
Here print.

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,380
Alan.

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:57,780
Here.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,760
Firstly, I need over while first.

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,300
Okay.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,060
So under this while running.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,560
Just honoring the Gottlieb record and put the system not honored.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,420
Friend Alan here and simply copy this.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,020
Here I will write.

21
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,640
Firstly, it will start with the.

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,180
Okay.

23
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,280
I need.

24
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,380
New Start one.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,540
So now what we need.

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,540
Okay.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,850
So next thing which we need the wall.

28
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,460
Look, the first thing we need to do is to start the combat with an enemy.

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,800
So the first thing we are going to do is find an enemy.

30
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,270
Set up the stats for it and then start combat with it.

31
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,750
So let's go ahead and say here, I will see here.

32
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,960
What do first we need?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,470
Okay.

34
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,340
So.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,510
Okay.

36
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,670
So I will see in anime.

37
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,630
Anime healthier and simply not.

38
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:40,420
If you remember up here we have set a variable called maximum anime health here.

39
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:49,360
This is the maximum amount of the A health and anime can have, but it can have a kind of more than

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,310
this, but it can have less because we don't want it to be flat.

41
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,400
What is 70 the whole time?

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,910
We are going to go ahead and set the value of the anime health each time because again it's going to

43
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,960
be a random and we are going to set this here.

44
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,850
Equal to here.

45
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,350
Going to set it.

46
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:23,950
And I'm sacred equal to the random object which we have are dot, which is the random object which we

47
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,490
have here.

48
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:34,480
And the next matter we use now, we will put the full stop here and we have a lot of matter.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:44,680
So here we are going to use call the next int, next int here and just give it.

50
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,260
So it takes one parameter.

51
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,650
So this parameter is the maximum value.

52
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,050
So here I have the maximum enemy held here.

53
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,270
So this random that this random entire can be.

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,450
So the integer that is generated is going to be between zero and the number given.

55
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,370
And the number we are going to get is our variable right here.

56
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:22,310
With the maximum enemy held for the start of every duration, we are going to set enemy held equal to

57
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,540
a random number.

58
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,140
Why do we not honor maximum enemy health?

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,760
So we are going to go ahead and set the string next.

60
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:42,870
So here I will set a string called Enemy and we need to know which enemy we are fighting again.

61
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,540
And this is going to be randomly generated.

62
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,420
It is going to be a random selection from one of these here.

63
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,080
So we need to access one of these random names.

64
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:05,540
So we are going to go ahead and see enemies, grab the area and then do the square brackets.

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,940
Now, as we have learned, we need to put the index of the array inside the square brackets here.

66
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,360
So I will do.

67
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,320
Mhm.

68
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,670
And yeah.

69
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,760
And then mixing these games is going to be a random integer between zero and the length of this idea.

70
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,600
So the random integer between zero and the length of this area.

71
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,260
So by.

72
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:42,060
So by doing that it would mean zero and the length of the array we are going to generate a number.

73
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:50,820
So that is either with zero one, two or three and it's going to randomly pick one of these each time.

74
00:05:51,660 --> 00:06:03,120
So inside the index for the array we are going to see here, we need the enemies and just put a dot

75
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,270
here and start, Len.

76
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:07,830
Here.

77
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,910
We need the right name first.

78
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,300
Then the next.

79
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,150
Next integer and just put up the enemy.

80
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,200
Start.

81
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,540
And it means dark land.

82
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,380
Okay, so we are accessing the enemies area here.

83
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,570
This.

84
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,850
They are not.

85
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,260
Nada.

86
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,330
We need a square bracket.

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,260
Okay.

88
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,830
And it means dirt land, which we have.

89
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,370
Okay.

90
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:27,680
Here each time they look inside the next for the area, we are going to say round here the next end

91
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
and then the parameter is going to be start length.

92
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:40,490
So we are accessing the enemy's area here and then the index and we are using this as a random integer

93
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,210
between zero and the maximum length of this area here.

94
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:55,410
So now that we have the name of the enemy, we can go ahead and just simply write this down note on

95
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,220
dot print in here.

96
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,910
And under this we can I set this up beforehand.

97
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,540
So there is going to be a actually format of the game.

98
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,380
And so it is a text page, obviously.

99
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,340
So here we have to write.

100
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,780
It's okay.

101
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,340
We need some format here, so I will take the three.

102
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,780
Okay.

103
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,570
Hmm.

104
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,970
Just a minute.

105
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,490
What I can do.

106
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,620
What format?

107
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,640
Okay.

108
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,760
I will start with the backslash D.

109
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,570
This is the character for tab in the console.

110
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:45,500
So we are going to tab forwards one and then we are going to say we are going to do this.

111
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,750
Same here.

112
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,630
First, the hash here.

113
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,080
No, not the hash we need.

114
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,950
We will take it with the.

115
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,970
What I will do.

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,300
But with this

117
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:19,150
we are we have used the symbol here and then a space here, and then we are going to see plus here and

118
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,920
plus we need the enemy string.

119
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,320
Now the next thing.

120
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,980
Will Shu has appeared.

121
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,540
Okay.

122
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,170
And just simply put.

123
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,930
Okay.

124
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:54,570
Just simply put the symbol here and the backslash and and then so here, let's explain what the string

125
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:54,660
is.

126
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:03,840
So first of all, we do our tab, then we do a symbol here like we do a tab, then we do a symbol like

127
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,540
this and we do the name of the enemy here, which is going to be appeared.

128
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:17,940
So here I have right has a beard and then another slash with the symbol here and I have the backslash

129
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,780
and make sure it moves on to the next line.

130
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,730
So it's like a line break.

131
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,770
We're moving to the next line.

132
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:34,920
So if I do a comment here like, okay, not the command, what I will show you, this would look like

133
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,730
an example.

134
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,110
We have tab then.

135
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,170
So just simply run this and.

136
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,450
Okay.

137
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,420
Okay.

138
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,200
He's not stopping because I have not done it.

139
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:02,650
Okay.

140
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,170
Okay, let's control.

141
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,070
Let's see.

142
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,550
Okay.

143
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,140
You can see the output of our it totally showing the rhino variables.

144
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,770
It will going okay, so it is creating over here so we can see our format here.

145
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,270
This is going to be.

146
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,910
Show up in the console right here.

147
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:32,860
You can see the output over next thing, which we have to do, we need to actually add the world for

148
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,340
that.

149
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,630
So this is an example of what it would like to look like.

150
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,290
So here it would look like this in the console.

151
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,540
So now that we have the enemy appearing, we need to set another loop.

152
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,360
So the next video which we have.
