1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:09.110
First class is the payment class, which is used to pay the payment for the hotels and the package or

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.800
everything.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.390
So this is class is defined inside the package travel and we have imported the package here.

4
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.090
Import 1.8. colour.

5
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.810
So this package will help us with the different colours provided by this package.

6
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.930
Then there is another cost in the package container which will help us to contain all the elements of

7
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.960
the interface into a container.

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.560
Then there is a font which will help us to manage font.

9
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.460
The styling in this window.

10
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:52.460
Then there is a dot dot image which will let us create an access image from our device and action event

11
00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.290
will help us to perform any event on buttons and any kind of event.

12
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.590
Mouse click or keyboard key pressed or.

13
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.260
But then.

14
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.340
Then there is the action listener by which we can define the action performed event.

15
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.250
And there is a Java export swing to provide a better interface of the graphical user interface.

16
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:24.520
After that, we have initiated the definition of the class payment, which is extending the frame and

17
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.240
being inside the class.

18
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.770
We have defined the non parameter constructor payment inside which we have set the layout as null.

19
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.550
After that we have set the bounds for the frame whose location will be 600 comma to 20 and its size

20
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.430
will be 800, cross 600.

21
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.080
So this will be the size of that payment window.

22
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.970
After that, we have defined a label labeled as pay the payment and set the font for that label.

23
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.390
Font families as a real font type as bold, and its font size is 40.

24
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.060
And then we have set the bound for that label.

25
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.850
So the size location is 50, comma 20 and its size will be 350 plus 45.

26
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.210
Then we have added that label to our.

27
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.840
A frame up that we have created an image icon instance which will be loading the image from over a specified

28
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.780
part which we have passed into it.

29
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.490
So it is using class loader.

30
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.700
Get system resource.

31
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.880
So get system resource will help us to load the image by passing the location of that image to it,

32
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.870
to that method.

33
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.880
So we have passed icons .6. jpg that will be the name and location of our image.

34
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.680
This will get the image from there.

35
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.070
Then we will create an image object eight, which will be getting the image and scaling its instance.

36
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.290
So it will be fixing the size of that image and storing the image icon that is it.

37
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.340
Now we have created another image icon and on the basis of the previous X, so that will create an image

38
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.990
icon object nine.

39
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:12.390
After that we have added that image icon object I9 into the label into our label.

40
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.260
So that label will hold this the image I9, I9 and after that we have set the bound for that label.

41
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:27.060
The label will look at it as zero comma, 150 and its size will be 800, cross 600.

42
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.120
Then we have added a label to our frame.

43
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:38.040
After that there is a button P which will be labelled as P and the inside, which we have added.

44
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.650
It's actually list of the button for that.

45
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.750
We have performed the event.

46
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.890
So inside the action performed method, which is taking an action event, we have defined the dialog

47
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.430
box only g option pinned or so message dialog passed it null and payment done successfully.

48
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.140
So after when you click on paste, it will show that payment done successfully.

49
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.590
It is not referring to any payment page because that will create sometimes errors and that not looked

50
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.460
like a better interface as well.

51
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.960
So we have just showed the display box dialog box has been mentioned successfully.

52
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.900
After that we have set the bound for that pay button.

53
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.920
So bound for 2020 will be the location of the button and its size will be 80 cross 40.

54
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.540
After that, we have added the button to our frame.

55
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.390
After that, there is another button labelled as back.

56
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.360
This will let us move back from that window.

57
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.360
After that, this we have added action for that back button as well.

58
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.700
So inside which we have defined the action performed inside the action form.

59
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.580
We have set the visibility of the current window as false.

60
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.550
After that, we have set the bound of the back button location as five, ten, comma 20 and sizes eight,

61
00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.600
cross 40.

62
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.940
Then we have added the back button to our frame.

63
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.420
After that, we have set the background colour of the window as white and set the visibility of the

64
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.940
window as to inside the main function.

65
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.740
What we have did is creating a new payment instance and setting the visibility as true.

66
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.520
Now let's have a look on our about Java file.

67
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.610
So this is our about Java file.

68
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.950
So it is defined inside the package travel.

69
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.980
We have imported the necessary package.

70
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.730
First one is java JWT, which will help us to create graphical user interface.

71
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:42.150
Java dot dot event package will help us to manage events in this window.

72
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.840
Java exports linked package will help us to create attractive designing for the window and a dot font

73
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.240
will help us to manage the font, styling, size and family of the font in this window.

74
00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:02.730
Java X door frame will help us to design a window energy frame and Singapore class will help us to create

75
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.930
a shorter four hour window.

76
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.510
After that, we have defined our about class this about class field holding the information about this

77
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.590
project and this web based, desktop based application.

78
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.140
So which is extending frame and implementing action listener inside which we have a button instance

79
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:26.100
B one and a label instance L one, three font instances F, F and F two and a one text instance demon

80
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.360
and a string instance.

81
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.760
As then we have defined the.

82
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.220
Non parameterized constructor about setting the layout of the frame as null.

83
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.080
Then we have defined a button labelled as exit, adding that button to our frame.

84
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:48.280
After that, we have set the bound for the button whose location will be one comma for 30 and its size

85
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.980
will be 120 cross 20.

86
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.600
After that we have added accent listener to the button.

87
00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:00.310
Then we have created a font object new font railway font bold type is bold and font size is 180 and

88
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.660
set the font f.

89
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.680
After that we have defined a string which it containing about project.

90
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.330
The objective of the Travel Training Management Project is to develop that automates the process.

91
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.040
So this is all about the introduction which we have stored inside the ESC, inside a string with the

92
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.060
list and the new line.

93
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.290
All, all of this.

94
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.520
After that, we have created a.

95
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.450
Text area.

96
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.070
So text area.

97
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.580
We have created an object of the text in a new text area past that is string in the text area its location

98
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.720
will be ten, comma 40 and it will be a scrollable vertical.

99
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.280
And after that.

100
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.960
We have set the editable property of this text area as false, so we cannot edit that text.

101
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.150
It will non editable and after that we have set the bound for that.

102
00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:01.260
Bacteria, which will be location is 2100 and its size will be for 50 cross 300.

103
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.690
Then we have added that text area to our frame.

104
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:14.600
After that we have defined the font f one and that is railway font mold 16 and set and set the font

105
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.860
over the text area.

106
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.930
So this font property will be applied over the content of the text area.

107
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.450
After that, there is a container.

108
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.920
We have defined the content pane.

109
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:32.600
The stored content pane will get the content pane and even new text areas or even is equal to new text

110
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.870
area.

111
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:38.790
And there is a label about project adding that label to our frame.

112
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:45.740
After that, we have defined the bounds for that label, whose location is one 7100 and its size is

113
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.030
180 cross 80.

114
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.800
After that there is al1 set or foreground.

115
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.430
This is color dot red.

116
00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:00.810
So it will be of red colour setting the colour of the label, then the font F2 font, family railway

117
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:06.390
font type, bold font size 20, setting the font for that particular label.

118
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.010
After that, there is a set LB which will set the bound for the complete window.

119
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:17.400
The location is 700 comma to 20 and its size is 500 plus 550 layout as null and set with visibility

120
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.900
of the current window as true.

121
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.920
After that, inside the action performance event, we will just expose the current class and inside

122
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.140
the main function we have just created the instance of the current class and set the visibility of the

123
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.060
window as true.

124
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:40.510
So this is all about the last remaining two classes of this project that is travel and tourism management

125
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.260
system.

126
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.660
And let's have a look at the run running of these two classes.

127
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.430
So I'll be running first payment class if I run this class.

128
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.310
This is how the payment class will look like.

129
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.040
Pay the payment.

130
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.540
We will click on pay or either back.

131
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:04.710
So if I click on pay, it will show payment done successfully because we are just showing a dialog box.

132
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.710
If I click on back it will be closed.

133
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.750
This is the output of payment class if I show you the output of about class.

134
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.920
So.

135
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.760
That's how the about class output will look like.

136
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.760
This is the about project which is vertical.

137
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.920
It is vertically scrollable.

138
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:32.340
You can see the definition about projects here.

139
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.500
Click on Exit, it will move us back to the page.

140
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:47.970
So this is all about these two classes.
