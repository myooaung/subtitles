1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,190
So in previous things I told you about.

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:12,030
I created this session with some user name, then submit part, log out part.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,060
I'm going to play it here.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,890
So I just added some more geosphere and I will tell you what in this post.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,990
So this is pure JSP.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,570
As you can see, there is not here.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,280
So the create topic to create and topic todo is can then get attribute.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,700
Please log in first if I log in or I'm just logged in.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,280
Inside this parameter is topic and email.

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:44,470
I have to set the email and which is I'm going to perform this which is basically select store and I'm

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,610
going to create this topic.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,090
So let me tell you what I'm going to do here is.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,840
So this is all about this class and part, and this is the GDP sitting here.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,380
So let me mention my password.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,960
If you know your password you can use because default I'm just adding this system and Oracle system

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,900
is username and this is my password for the Oracle database to give the entry to the Oracle database.

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:18,400
Still, I haven't created this part, so I need to mention this topic each and everything using the

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,300
my listener part.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,510
But I will tell you how I'm going to do that part in later.

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,970
So this is the same thing.

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,250
Then let me show you the delete things.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,690
Delete thing is also similar.

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,300
I'm doing it again, okay, because I change it to the my team.

24
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,290
So this is all about to delete that part then for the discussion part.

25
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,810
Also, these are the all things here following the discussion.

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,800
So I'm just adding some random text here to the discussion each and everything.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,070
We're.

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,920
So this is all about how I'm going to develop this.

29
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,400
Okay.

30
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,230
Okay.

31
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,740
So.

32
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,000
Let me show you the phone.

33
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,690
Fine.

34
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,440
So basically fine name is to find the username.

35
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,320
And this is the oracle.

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,590
You need to understand this.

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,140
What is these things?

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,570
So this is the URL.

39
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:29,800
Or we can say driver here and this is the my prepared statement select start from this I'm going to

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,700
create and all the things I'm mentioned here.

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,820
Then the find name is also similar.

42
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,130
I need to mention my password here.

43
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,740
I haven't created any table inside that, but I'm using Java file only to create this and I will tell

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,330
you how I'm going to do this.

45
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,830
So fine.

46
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,260
Name one is for finding the name.

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,130
So all the teams are having some useful things here.

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,700
As you can see, this is very similar to this, but there are more usefulness for this that I will tell

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,830
you in later part

50
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,620
each find them as having their own functions.

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,220
But I will tell you what is the significance of this in later.

52
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,740
But remember that for finding each name you don't need to create each things.

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:30,640
But while developing this, I understood that for checking from different different aspects, like from

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,880
country or fine from state.

55
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,620
I need to create this instances like from finding the inserting.

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,930
I need to create this through the email.

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,680
So I need to create one another finding here because I don't want to mention similar things.

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,720
So let me save this first.

59
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,120
Close this post because these things are over.

60
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,790
As you can see, these are all the teams here.

61
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,850
And when I just added this, so I need to add one library here.

62
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,400
So this note.

63
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,250
Let me move to the Ed Jar folder here.

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,830
Once they see click, it will load to this file.

65
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,260
So let me go to my jar file here.

66
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,900
So it is that is worse.

67
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,230
In Oracle database.

68
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,050
I am having this fight, so.

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,870
This is a.

70
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,720
So I will be open.

71
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,250
Look at this wide open GDP.

72
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,490
It will take time to load.

73
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,870
As you can see, this is loading now gbk 14th version so you can use this part.

74
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,480
So as you can see, this is loaded now.

75
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,040
So it will.

76
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,580
Wait for these things.

77
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,430
Dispensing these known addicts.

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,900
Let me say this again.

79
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,160
So instead of putting this again and again, you can create one another.

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,050
Java fail to mention this part, but I'm putting it again and again.

81
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:35,730
Well, then this is the one for if you forget some text to get in for each and everything I'm adding

82
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:41,520
here, or if you want to add some more part in your file, you can add this.

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,470
So I added this part just for backup purposes.

84
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:54,780
You can see this all the things some including part and header GSP is nothing, but I'm adding one header

85
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,220
in one file to three files.

86
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,760
So for this purpose log out JSP each and everything.

87
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,320
I'm adding this part.

88
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,440
So that's it about who I'm going to add it.

89
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,050
Let's create one more thing here.

90
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,710
So what is the listener thing is just basically to create one.

91
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:19,560
Or we can say create all things here, like just creating, not creating only the servlet.

92
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,890
I need to create everything here.

93
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,000
So let me do this.

94
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,110
So.

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,810
No, I don't want to hear this.

96
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,710
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add one Java class in default package on new, which is basically

97
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,370
solid.

98
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,400
I'm mentioning the solid name as this might.

99
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,350
So you can add the package here.

100
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,700
Okay.

101
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,040
So, listen, we highly recommend do not add this, so let me cancel this.

102
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,980
Let me create one package here instead of creating in default package, let me create one Java package

103
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,370
here.

104
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,640
Our packages basically connector.

105
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,960
Great finish.

106
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,290
So.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,870
In this.

108
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,160
Let me add a one.

109
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,280
So let me match my solid.

110
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,020
Click next and add this information to a dot examiner.

111
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,740
So it will take time to load everything.

112
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,540
And once this is done, you can check your connector app is done.

113
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,050
As you can see.

114
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,520
Okay.

115
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,720
So this is done.

116
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:44,670
What I'm going to do is and closing this part and maintaining this and I'm deleting this part, I will

117
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,960
tell you that I am doing this because I don't want to put everything here.

118
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,450
Now let me import some files.

119
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,890
Import Java x dot.

120
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,980
Lord Stern.

121
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,060
Then in Java dot school.

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,910
Don't start.

123
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,550
So I'm going to add these files.

124
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,600
Now, let me create one public class.

125
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,670
Public.

126
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,290
Class.

127
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,120
My.

128
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,680
Listener or listening what my listener implements.

129
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,410
Oh, no.

130
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,870
I need one thing here while I need to create implementation using solid.

131
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,300
I don't want to put that everything.

132
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,630
Like try catch and everything.

133
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm going to use that.

134
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,120
No, no.

135
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,020
But I don't want to put that HTTP request responsibility.

136
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,660
What I can do, I can add directly your servlet.

137
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,590
Context.

138
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,190
Listener So which is nothing but.

139
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,820
So.

140
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,140
It will take care of this, my listener.

141
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,080
So it's not abstract.

142
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,800
So currently it's not abstract.

143
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,320
So what I can do is I can implement that all abstract methods later.

144
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,910
So I will tell you how I'm going to do this and everything here.

145
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,770
But let me add one more thing.

146
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,190
Because it's there is no method.

147
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,810
So I need to create one method.

148
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,370
Public void.

149
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,210
This.

150
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,610
Mr..

151
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,990
And all the things I added.

152
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,810
So it's showing me that.

153
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,490
It is not abstract.

154
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,370
Do not overwrite with context, it so little context event or anything.

155
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,140
So I need to create this class or the.

156
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,530
So you can create abstract classes like this.

157
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,760
You can mention this.

158
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,520
So is one thing here I just want to mention and let me create one connection.

159
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,750
Then I need to mention string.

160
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,950
User is equal to system, which is for the oracle database.

161
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,520
Then I need to mention string pass is equal to.

162
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,960
Bossman booty.

163
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,340
My data is.

164
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,580
I'm going to do this.

165
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:05,920
Okay.

166
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,160
So this is it.

167
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,480
I'm going to create.

168
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,190
But let me create one class for name each and everything because I want you mentioned right here.

169
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,960
Let me add one.

170
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,970
Also.

171
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,880
Exception in.

172
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,960
Justin.

173
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,050
Dot.

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,480
Dot.

175
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,320
Ellen.

176
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,830
Section.

177
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,850
So that's it.

178
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm not going to mention everything like class for naming everything which I already created.

179
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:06,000
Then on I'm going to create a one connection here on is equal to driver manager everything dimension.

180
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,620
So I don't want to waste time in this.

181
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,570
So what you can do is I already created here somewhere in the Justine.

182
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,290
I can use this directly.

183
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,050
Okay.

184
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:38,560
So instead of using this, what I can mention is here, because this is direct passing and I want to

185
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,850
create one abstract thing here.

186
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,410
So what I can do is this.

187
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:42,830
Okay.

188
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,540
You wouldn't pass because these are the two things I can use directly here.

189
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,010
So this is all about how I can perform this.

190
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,750
So let me add some prepared statements and create everything here.

191
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,950
So do all the things I'm going to create.

192
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,800
I forgot to add one thing.

193
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,430
Okay.

194
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,640
So these are the things which I'm going to adhere to clear statement, execute update, I'm going to

195
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,480
create table.

196
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:32,030
So you can create one sequence here each and everything I'm going to create here with replace some triggers.

197
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,430
I'm going to create all that in here.

198
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,570
So this is all about how I'm creating here.

199
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,430
If you want to add one more thing, you can add another thing here.

200
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,310
Let me ask this.

201
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,570
So let me add one more thing here.

202
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,290
It is basically to update everything here.

203
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,670
Okay.

204
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,880
So let me add one more method.

205
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,760
The project is deployed and deployed.

206
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,110
So that's it.

207
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,170
Who I can add.

208
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,380
This is my listener part.

209
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,810
So that's about how I edit and apply the triggers.

210
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,900
So this is it about this process.

211
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,870
And my listener is just for creating or replacing the trigger creating table, which is basically,

212
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,570
as you can see, this forum registration.

213
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:38,210
And if you have seen this, you can see this forum or you can see everything here is I'm going to create

214
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,380
throughout this project.

215
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,890
So my listener.

216
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,970
So what are you going to do?

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,910
You can execute this first and you are going to mention this or what you can do.

218
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:53,550
You can directly run these files or you can directly run this on your site and you can develop this

219
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,660
so in for everything.

220
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,650
I'm going to create one JSP to run this file directly.

221
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,090
My listener Java.

222
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,420
So hope you understand this part.

223
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,130
In later part I'm going to mention everything and how I displayed everything.

224
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,420
These parts.

225
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,050
And next part, I'm going to tell you what is the next thing I'm going to use?
