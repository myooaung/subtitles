WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.530
So that we will get the background.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.250
No, I think I have.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.910
Okay.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:17.310
Just remove this background matter and here I will take the new color and give the parameter to two

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.050
five, five, two, five, five, two, two, four and done.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.990
Now we need to fill the recto side.

7
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.320
And so what we have to do.

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
We will write the rectangle.

9
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.750
Okay.

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.380
So we have the specified rectangle here with the right and the left edges.

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.260
So here I will write no zero.

12
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.660
Just the y coordinate with the zero here.

13
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.090
Next thing which we have the edge.

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.300
It will be.

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.530
Okay.

16
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.440
Here we will firstly give the third tier.

17
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.320
So here I will write this to get.

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.100
We literally have created here.

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.930
We have to give the height here.

20
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.680
So here I will right at height.

21
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.210
And now what we have to do, we will create a list which includes all objects of the game.

22
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.520
So here I will do I will create an array list of the actor.

23
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.410
Close.

24
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.510
Which we have already actor here I will write.

25
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.310
We will see the body of it afterwards.

26
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.850
Here I will create that actor class.

27
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.090
You have the whole right new ArrayList.

28
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:07.030
And then after that, we need to create all the world list which include all objects.

29
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.190
So here I will write Voldemort and all.

30
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.730
Here I will give it to the false.

31
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.090
Next one is the warlord at all.

32
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.400
Give it to the areas

33
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.930
key.

34
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.500
We need a head on.

35
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.820
We can remove afterwards when we write the body of it.

36
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.360
Okay.

37
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.040
Here.

38
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.900
I will try it back.

39
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.690
Done.

40
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:10.900
Next on which we need the one not and all we have the support one.

41
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.390
So this is done.

42
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.670
We have created a list which includes all objects of the game.

43
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.950
Now we will create through the world container and draw the objects.

44
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.090
So we need a for loop here.

45
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.340
So I will write for.

46
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.510
It will start with the end.

47
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.380
I set it to the zero here.

48
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.280
I should be less than with the whole dot size.

49
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:56.690
And I plus plus bracket opened me to take the whole actor class with the variable item and set with

50
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.670
the wall dot cat.

51
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.830
And next, I know we have to check with some condition here.

52
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.830
So here I will write item instance of the player class also.

53
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.800
So here I will write the instance of player class.

54
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.960
And next condition which we have item the instance of

55
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.770
instance off and the next is one the baggage here.

56
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.970
Which we have created these classes, the market and the player.

57
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.280
So we have the baggage.

58
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.140
Now we will iterate through the world container and draw the objects here.

59
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.810
So the player and the baggage images are a bit smaller.

60
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.310
So we are too close to that coordinate to center them.

61
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.550
So here what we will write.

62
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.890
Here I will draw the image.

63
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.690
So we need the draw image method.

64
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.350
So I will try to draw image.

65
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.700
And I will say this.

66
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.620
Return the item.

67
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.730
Note get image.

68
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.600
And next one is the item that.

69
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.400
Thanks.

70
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.520
Next one.

71
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.740
Here it is added to the two.

72
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.590
Next one which we need item not why add and to the two.

73
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.500
Next and the last which we need.

74
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.490
Here.

75
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.420
Here.

76
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.770
We will write this

77
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.750
and what we can do here.

78
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:20.620
We can have the health condition that we will here, the health condition here, and just try to change

79
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.810
our image.

80
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.040
Here.

81
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.900
I will give.

82
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.520
I don't get the image.

83
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.240
Next one is the item, not X.

84
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.120
And then, I don't know, an item or two.

85
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.890
Why?

86
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.160
Last one is this.

87
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.010
Remove this other one and just turn.

88
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.080
And doctors ALS.

89
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.340
Lou, we have to check with another condition.

90
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.890
This will take a matter first.

91
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.950
It should be the is completed and which you will create afterwards.

92
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.650
And I will set the color.

93
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:21.150
Just new color and give the parameter 2000.

94
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.450
Just draw the string and give.

95
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.010
Completed

96
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.180
here.

97
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:41.160
Take the X coordinate with the Y here.

98
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.960
20.

99
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.290
So here what we have done, we trade through the world container and draw the objects.

100
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.590
The player and the baggage images are a bit smaller.

101
00:07:52.590 --> 00:08:02.430
So we here we have added two blocks to their coordinates to center them and now we have created if the

102
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:10.110
level is completed, we drop completed in the upper left, upper left corner of the window.

103
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.600
So after that.

104
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:22.970
We will do more after completing these bodies here.

105
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.030
So just start.

106
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.590
No, we need.

107
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.450
We have done now.

108
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.870
We need to create a compressed event also.

109
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.600
So what we will do.

110
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.320
Right.

111
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.720
Before that.

112
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.930
We need a paint component matter too.

113
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:55.280
So after here, we will take the public wine and write the paint component and give the argument with

114
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.390
the graphics.

115
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:05.060
We just need to super not paint component.

116
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.180
Near the volleyball.

117
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.670
Give G.

118
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.260
Don't.

119
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.530
Now we need the key pressed matter.

120
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.580
We have to be.

121
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.880
We have you created.

122
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.460
We're here.

123
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:32.480
We have already done we have used the component of the key listener.

124
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:40.920
So what we will do here, we have we should create we will create the key pressed matter.

125
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:53.790
So after this, we will write private class, which will be named as the adapter, which should exchange

126
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.160
the key adapter here.

127
00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.370
No,

128
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.870
not this.

129
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.210
We have the matter.

130
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.340
Public void.

131
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.830
Keep rest and give the event.

132
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.110
Key event.

133
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.330
E.

134
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.170
You know, what we have to do is sign the key press matter.

135
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.660
We will check what keys were pressed.

136
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.570
We control the command object with the cursor keys.

137
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:40.220
If we press the left or key, we check if the SO command collides with the wall or with the baggage.

138
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.460
If it does not, we move the command to the left.

139
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.300
So firstly, it will check if it's completed.

140
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.900
No, not simply write written.

141
00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:01.100
And know next thing which we need, we have to get the key.

142
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.990
What key is pressed.

143
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:10.780
So take a variable in key and we will get the key code.

144
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.530
Check what key is pressed here.

145
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.010
So it will return the integer.

146
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.120
What you have to do will go with some switch keys here.

147
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.770
So we need the switch just here.

148
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.630
Now we need to.

149
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:33.770
Okay.

150
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.220
So what we will do if.

151
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.900
If we press the left cursor key, we check if the one collides with the one or with a magnet.

152
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.430
If it does not mean we, we will move the one to the left.

153
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.710
Here.

154
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.140
I will mention some such cases.
