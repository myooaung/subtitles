WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.090
So here is our IDE.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.020
First file is about java file.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.270
So this file is inside the package.

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.110
Electricity.

5
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.170
We have imported the necessary package which will be used.

6
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.580
Whose classes and methods will be used in this our file.

7
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.120
Then we will.

8
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.200
Public class.

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.440
We have used as a framework and swing framework in this class.

10
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.260
So first public class about it is extending the GE frame which will manage our complete window output

11
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.840
window and implementing the action listener whose methods will be redefined for the actions which will

12
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.700
perform on the button.

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.400
So we have a button, button instance we want a label, instance, 11, three, font, instance F,

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.480
F, one and f21, text eight, instance t one and a string s.

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.510
Inside the constructor of the class we have set the layout as well default and then initializing the

16
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.650
button name.

17
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.960
First button name is B, one name is exit, adding the button, setting the bounds for the button and

18
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.910
adding action listener because a button will be handling any event.

19
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.390
So we have added action now so that it can handle those events.

20
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.440
Whenever any event is performed on the button, then we have initializing the font type, it's type,

21
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.000
it's bold and its size.

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.810
Then we set the font by using set font method.

23
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.340
Now we have initialized the string.

24
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.880
This is the string which we have initialized, which will be shown in the about project.

25
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.090
When we run this file text area, we have initialize the text area passing that string, it's x and

26
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.440
y coordinate and the scrollbar it is vertically scrollable, so it is editable.

27
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.570
We have set it as editable false.

28
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.580
So we cannot edit that text area, set the bounds for the text data and adding that text to the frame.

29
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.650
Then we have a front frame again setting the types of frame initializing and setting those frame to

30
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.820
our text area.

31
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.790
Now again container content and getting the content of the frame and now initializing that even as a

32
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.750
new text area.

33
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.390
Then we have initialize the label element whose name will be about project, adding the label, setting

34
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.870
the bounds for the label and setting the foreground color for the label.

35
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.790
So label will be represented in red color font F to initialize the type of the font F two and set the

36
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.510
font due to the label one, adding that to label one setting the bounds for the j frame layout as null

37
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.790
and visibility of the frame is true.

38
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:32.650
Now implementing the action perform element which will take E as input and it will be disposed only

39
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.430
one thing that will be closed on the press of exit button.

40
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.990
So let's see how its output will be shown inside main function we have called the new about and set

41
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.350
visible.

42
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.430
True, so we will setting the visibility of this window will be to run file then will show this is how

43
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.750
the file will be shown.

44
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.920
This is the output.

45
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.790
Output about project is showing in red color and inside the text area.

46
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.010
This is the information about the project.

47
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.740
When we press the exit button, it will close them and nothing will happen.

48
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.040
So this is about Dark Java file.

49
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.680
Next we will move on to the log and or Java file.

50
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.610
Again, we have created this log inside the package electricity using the Abstract Window Toolkit and

51
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.300
swing class.

52
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.060
It will also use as well as it will connect with our database also, which we have created using that

53
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.730
common Java file in our previous video.

54
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.120
Now public class login ID exchange frame will be used to create the window and it implements Excel,

55
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.280
which will handle the events on the buttons.

56
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.010
So if there are four labels as well and two, three and L for one text field tf1 password field pef

57
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.740
two three buttons, we will be to be three panels p, one P to p, four P to p three and p four and

58
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.800
one choice of command.

59
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.730
So inside log in we have initialized its name that is login page layout will be null and it's a background

60
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.540
color setting as the window for the white first label will be as username.

61
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.330
So we have added the label name user, setting the bounds for the user name and adding that label to

62
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.870
the frame.

63
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.540
Next we have the label as password.

64
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:14.440
Setting that password bounds and adding that password to the label from next is text area def one is

65
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.780
actually a text field, so we are adding that text field, setting the bounds for the text field that

66
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.770
will be used to enter username, adding that text field to the j frame.

67
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.900
Similarly for the password adding setting the bounds for the password and adding the password file.

68
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.250
Adding the password field in front of the password which will be used to enter the password.

69
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.100
Then there is l for label for login in as and it will be a choice.

70
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.040
So setting the bounds for this, adding that label for now here choice object is created initialize

71
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.020
and its two choices have been passed either admin or customers so you can choose from the dropdown menu.

72
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.570
It's bound has been set and added to the frame.

73
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.800
Now images.

74
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.530
We have used images on our buttons also.

75
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.790
So first is log in image which will have a which will be used in j button as log and its icon.

76
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.250
So image a login icon will be used on the login button, setting the bound for the button and adding

77
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.330
that button similarly.

78
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.570
Creating image icon object for the cancel button, adding that image icons and scaling its instance

79
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.730
as default and giving its size.

80
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.170
Then we will adding that image to the button which is named as cancel and that is that adding that image

81
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.560
icon.

82
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.310
Setting the bound for the buttons and adding that button to the other frame.

83
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.380
Next is sign up button for sign up.

84
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.060
We will also have an image.

85
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.610
Similarly, we will adding that image to the sign up button, setting the bound for the button and adding

86
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.280
that button to the frame.

87
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.860
Next, we have created or used the methods of past methods.

88
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.950
The B1, B2 and B three buttons, so that whenever it is, these event are performed on the button so

89
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.010
it can perform and produce the relevant result.

90
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:15.580
Now Image C three is a second image which will be shows as a user an image on the login page, adding

91
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.260
that label, setting the bound of the label and adding that label to the frame.

92
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.880
Next set layout layout of the window will be settings as border layout size.

93
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.540
This will be set the size of the window, location of the window and visibility is set as true.

94
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.110
Now action performed method is defined here.

95
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:42.940
If the action event is equal to button, if the extent event source is from B1, so B1 is used for login.

96
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.310
So if the login button is clicked, then we will first create the connection object of connection class

97
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:58.360
and the text field from the one in a string password field from PV two in a string V and selected item

98
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:05.110
from seven choice you in a string user execute the query select extract from login where username is

99
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:13.570
equal to this and password this and user is the type of this a, b and user initialize the results set

100
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.150
using the connection class and execute that query.

101
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.900
Pass that queue to the execute query as arguments so it can execute query.

102
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:27.760
Now asked next it used to iterate over the so it will print the next row from the database or from login

103
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.780
table, and then it will retrieve the meter number, get a string meter number.

104
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.640
So new after retrieving the meter number, it will call the project class of Java.

105
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.850
It is creating a sense of project class meter user pass the meter and user to the project constructor

106
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.920
and it's setting the visibility of the tool.

107
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:52.120
So project window visibility will be setting as true and current window visibility is false.

108
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.750
So this window will be closed and the project will will open if either ls.

109
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:05.050
So it will say invalid login if the details are not validated and set the text field and pass or fail

110
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:05.710
as null.

111
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.540
After that, if any exception occurs, it will handle the exception in the catch block.

112
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.190
LS if if the button b2 is pressed so b two is for cancel button.

113
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.950
So it will set the visibility of this window as false.

114
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:23.830
And if the button is B3, then it will set visibility of the current window false and create the instance

115
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.760
of the sign up class and setting the visibility of the signup class as true.

116
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.880
Now inside main method, we have created the login instance and setting the visibility of the login

117
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.690
window is true.

118
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.850
Now we will move up to the signup class.

119
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.880
So here is the signup class again inside the electricity package, importing the necessary swing and

120
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:48.820
blue packages used in this class signup class extending frame and implementation of one panel.

121
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.300
Instance P one text, instance t 1 to 2 to three t for choice instance and g button be one and two inside

122
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.260
the sign up sign up constructor.

123
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.850
We have set the bound for the window first initializing the panel, setting the bound from the panel

124
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:09.580
layout of the panel as null background color setting as white foreground color using the value we have

125
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.780
setting the foreground color.

126
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.090
Then we are setting the border of the panel.

127
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.140
One Create account.

128
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.750
Its name will be creating a title border reading title border null new color using the new color also

129
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:28.330
so it will create a border with the new color, adding that P1 panel to the frame.

130
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:35.020
Next, the label as a user name initializing is foreground color setting the type of font, adding the

131
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.560
bound for the element and adding the adding label one into the panel.

132
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.030
Panel one object.

133
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:49.360
Next is a text field setting the bound for the text field and adding that text value to the panel.

134
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:56.620
Again, we will creating the label to setting the foreground color font type bounds and adding that

135
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.050
panel label to the one.

136
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:05.110
Again, the text field bound, adding that text field to the panel.

137
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:13.480
Third, it is named as password and setting the foreground of the label font.

138
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.880
It's bound and adding that label.

139
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.830
It's their respective text field.

140
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:18.370
Three three.

141
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:25.360
Setting the bound and adding next level is a create account as label similarly created a foreground

142
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.440
font bound and edit that label 50 millimetres number entering meta number text field folder as text

143
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.610
field setting the visibility false and adding that to the panel.

144
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.080
Next is choice either admin or customer account.

145
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.070
You are creating setting the bounding for that and adding that panel.

146
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.370
Now see one dot add item listener.

147
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:53.260
So see when implementing the add item listener in which we will pass the item list, not object creating

148
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:59.620
the object and public void item estate change item event a so a string user to even get selected item.

149
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.690
So from C1 we will get the selected item.

150
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:07.450
If the user is equals to customer, then we will set the label file visibility through and fight for

151
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.320
visibility through.

152
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.280
LS Label five Visibility false and default for visibility false.

153
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.970
So for customer, these label 524 will be visible four and four elements.

154
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.640
Label five and four will not be visible.

155
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.240
After that.

156
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.820
We have created the button to create its foreground color and background color as black and white respectively,

157
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.980
setting the bound, adding event listener, action listener and added that button similarly for the

158
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:30.760
back button.

159
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:38.200
Then we have added the icon, assign up image also and adding that to the label, setting the bound

160
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.330
for the label and adding that to the panel.

161
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.010
Now action performed here.

162
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:47.810
We have in a implementing end refrain if it gets a label to be one, if click the button, be one,

163
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:55.180
then we will take the text from the get text daemon field name from the t two field password from the

164
00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:02.440
T three field user type from choice and meter number from be fulfilled now try initializing the connection

165
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.210
SDR pass as null.

166
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:12.460
If user is goes to admin then we will pass execute the query insert into login meter and username,

167
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.870
name, password and user.

168
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.510
That's the query else.

169
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:23.590
Then we will update login, set username, username, name, password and user where meta number is

170
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.570
equal to t four dot get text.

171
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.000
After that we will execute SDR query on the basis of either admin on customer.

172
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.440
The SDR will be selected.

173
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:39.130
Then we will show the message account created successfully and set the visibility of the current window

174
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.250
as false and move the window to the new login window as setting the visibility of the login window is

175
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:44.650
true.

176
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.200
Catching a session will handle the exception.

177
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.980
ElseIf If the button b two is selected, then we will set the visibility of the current window false

178
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.620
and move the user back to the login page again.

179
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.660
And here the main function we have setting the visibility of the sign up page as true.

180
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.040
So let's have a look on the first.

181
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.750
We will run the login page.

182
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.990
So here we will learn the login page.

183
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.450
So run the login page.

184
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.930
It will be shown as this username password.

185
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.500
Now we will kill consign upset will take us to the sign up page as well.

186
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.460
So here the sign up so we can create account here.

187
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:24.490
We will be doing all this in the separate video at last for the complete project overview output.

188
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.110
That will be video.

189
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:32.890
So in this video, that's all from the about login and signup class of this project.

190
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:40.120
Further in videos, we will be moving on to the next classes and knowing about the other classes of

191
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.750
this project.
