WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:13.000
We have already seen that how we can set up this project for online quiz project for JSP.

2
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.070
So it's very simple.

3
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.090
You have to just create a web project inside your ID with the Java EA version, Enterprise Edition version.

4
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:32.320
I'm going to use your Oracle database glasses server for all database connections, then deployment

5
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.070
on the server.

6
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.040
So before proceeding, I'm going to tell some important part regarding to this.

7
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.390
So what I created, I changed the indexed HTML for the loading page, loading landing page.

8
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.910
I will add also your.

9
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.870
Landing.

10
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.520
Each.

11
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.410
So this is our landing page.

12
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:05.690
I also added some bootstrap CSS and then some images here already and I change this part.

13
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.460
So as you can see for admin admin log in JSP, we have to create any student log in.

14
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.460
So in this session we are going to see how we can do this.

15
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.730
So this is very simple HTML and just added bootstrap cases.

16
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.650
You can see when things are created here in websites and everything, you can see your source packages

17
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.680
then all things libraries.

18
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.740
Also I added some and all things related to this part.

19
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.120
So this is all about how we can create index rotation or how we can set up our project.

20
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:57.200
But before proceeding with our project, I'm going to specify some simple Java servlet concepts and

21
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.690
some JSP concepts also.

22
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.660
So let us see what is the Java servlet?

23
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.850
So Java servlet is nothing but a technology in Java which used to create a web application.

24
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.730
So servlet is a Java API.

25
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.970
Which is application programming interface basically, which provides many interfaces and classes,

26
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.490
including with the documentation part and everything.

27
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.460
So, so documentation is already written.

28
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.170
So what is the Java servlet?

29
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.660
So you have written the HTML code and you want to put the data from that database means you have to

30
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.550
put HTML form data or your anything on the front end part to back end or you have to part to the server.

31
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.100
So for writing the logic behind this, we are going to use your Java servlet.

32
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.530
So servlet is an interface must be implemented for creating any servlet.

33
00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.380
And servlet is also class which extends the capabilities of the servers which respond requests.

34
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.890
So you can see we already server is running on the request and response types.

35
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:15.710
Similarly, servlet helps server to improve this regarding like databases and HTML part.

36
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.560
So so it is a web component that deployed on the server, not on your client machine.

37
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.070
It is deployed on the server part to create dynamic web pages.

38
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.340
So what is the static and dynamic page is?

39
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.950
Static means we are watching some part and it's static.

40
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.110
There is nothing is changing.

41
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.790
Or you can see the table is not showing contents again and again.

42
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.140
It's not updating.

43
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.550
So it's static.

44
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.970
Like you have created one university information page.

45
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.900
It is static.

46
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.770
You are showing the information page, it's static.

47
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:56.780
But if you want to add some part in that information using not using only HTML code, you have to use

48
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.540
some simple text editor or I can say on the website itself, you have to write.

49
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.930
You are going to say it is a dynamic web pages.

50
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.040
It's updating.

51
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.140
So it's dynamic Web pages.

52
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.110
So how so?

53
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.250
It works, actually.

54
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.500
So, so well.

55
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.580
It works on request and response.

56
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:24.790
Client sends response to server and server response generated and it's moved to the client.

57
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.590
So it's just like a copy of that part and sent to the client.

58
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.400
So.

59
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.670
So let's use this request.

60
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.570
DISPATCHER.

61
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.200
So the.

62
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.890
DISPATCHER The interface provides the facility of dispatching the request from another source HTML so

63
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.790
that our GSP.

64
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.920
So what is the GSP basically?

65
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.330
JSP is the Java servlet pages as you can see.

66
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.860
So so JSP contains all the things in further part.

67
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:58.890
I'm going to show the servlet and GSP board also, but before that, what is the difference between

68
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.050
servlet and GSP is.

69
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.410
So let's are pure java codes.

70
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.830
There is nothing inside this.

71
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.600
Like you can add HTML codes without that part, but GCP and servlet are both different.

72
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.040
So.

73
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.560
So that is just for connection.

74
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.520
But more than just JSP, you can visualize, you can create design also using CSS and statement.

75
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.920
So this is an interface also used to include contents from another resources.

76
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.600
So it's a one way also collaboration.

77
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.050
Or you can say there are two methods forward and include forward to forward request from so let to another

78
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.130
resource or includes the content of resource like you have to add into the same resource you have to

79
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.530
use include method or you want to forward it to something you have to use forward method.

80
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.090
Then as I told you, forward for forward method request is generated.

81
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:05.730
It's sent to servlet one created the response forwarding method or servlet two I can say or I can say

82
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.610
JSP or anything generates another response and send to the client.

83
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.860
Similarly for the include method what is done it's again so let's do our created two.

84
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.250
So let's architected or I can say to which HTML are created or to estimate statements we can create

85
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.150
which includes in the same page responses, generate same responses and send to the client.

86
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.660
So so that important parts are estimates such as front end.

87
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.230
Also program for back end logical method.

88
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.730
We brought XML for control.

89
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.950
That's it for the servlet.

90
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.940
Important parts.

91
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:55.400
So as you can, if you have seen the servlet codes, you can see its HTML is added inside Java as it

92
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.870
is added inside Java.

93
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.100
In GSP.

94
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.360
What is we are going to.

95
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.600
It's a java language inside the HTML pages.

96
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.460
So you can see it's like a scripting language, but it's your Java language.

97
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.440
So Java solid pages.

98
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.480
So JSP is technology is used to create a web application just like servlet technology.

99
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:24.390
But what is the difference between these are so let's are only Java codes with JSP as HTML codes which

100
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:32.430
contains some Java language so it can be taught of extension of servlet, you can say, but it provides

101
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.930
more functionality than solid, such as some expression languages.

102
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.200
GSD There are some gestural technology also you can use.

103
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.920
So JSP page contains HTML tags, some JSP tags.

104
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.920
Also JSP pages are easier to maintain.

105
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.930
You have to always remember these are very easier to maintain.

106
00:07:52.930 --> 00:08:01.360
You no need to check for every step again and again in JSP and its provide some additional features

107
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.670
like expression, language and custom text.

108
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.830
So let us see how we can create JSP page inside our IDE.

109
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.880
So this is my idea I already created.

110
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.350
So.

111
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.240
So source package contains all the java packages.

112
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.910
But before that in go to the web pages.

113
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.760
You're just right click here, click in new and you can see JSP.

114
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.050
JSP.

115
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.140
Hope you can see the G-spot here.

116
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.100
Once you right click here, click new and GSP.

117
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.330
Click here.

118
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:47.350
You can see all the entity Glasson but choose GSP part, so specify the name for this once that another

119
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.220
dialog box is basically created when you are doing this.

120
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:58.020
So for me, let me close this and let me check what is I'm going to do.

121
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:58.640
Okay.

122
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.940
I'm going to copy this part basically, because my name is this.

123
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:12.840
Once this is done, you have to put this on Web pages, standards and things will just be you have to

124
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.770
choose nothing.

125
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.310
Or then click finish.

126
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.020
So it will take time to create one JSP page.

127
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.190
As you can see, JSP page is created.

128
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.610
Let me cancel this because.

129
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.660
And.

130
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.510
Okay.

131
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.550
So this is our JSP page.

132
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.530
Let us post build our project.

133
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.850
Let us see how it's clean and build first.

134
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.750
Then I'm going to change here because I want to create some log in form.

135
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.540
We can say I want to create here.

136
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.060
So let us first clean and build.

137
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.890
If your window is matching output windows and ordering, go to this and click output.

138
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.470
You can see be successful.

139
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.450
Now let us run our project.

140
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:16.300
So it will take time to load the glass feed server first time when you are entering the first time because

141
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.720
Java Hotspot Server VM is running.

142
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.640
So it takes time to load that server and deploy all the pages on that server.

143
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:33.070
But once it is done, no need to again and again executing this in the JSP as we are doing in a Java

144
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.530
servlet, we have to again and again build that part.

145
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.560
No need to build that part again and again in JSP.

146
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:44.200
As I'm telling just one time, build and just you have to add your code.

147
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.620
Then after all things are done, just click Final Run and again check.

148
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.140
So as you can see, it's taking time to load.

149
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.890
So as you can see, all things are deploying.

150
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.750
So once it is done, you can see our portal is deployed.

151
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:50.500
You may face the delay of this loading because what I am using these images using through URL and URL

152
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.420
and I'm also adding some services.

153
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.300
So we already created this student page.

154
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.230
So when you click this, you can see the JSP page is loaded here.

155
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.520
Helloworld, which I had, which we already created here.

156
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.470
As you can see.

157
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.460
So this is our JSP page we already created.

158
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:13.130
So I'm going to change the code here and I'm going to explain also that part.

159
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:24.380
So remember, JSP is sometimes slower than Java servlet, but as you can see, we can add some exciting

160
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:33.800
animations and things inside JSP as we have some power to change all HTML codes using JSP.

161
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.580
So let us see how I'm going to change this part.

162
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.610
So let me.

163
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.440
Delete this first.

164
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.590
And.

165
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.840
And this is for comment part only.

166
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.720
So I'm just.

167
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.930
Due to time constraint, I'm going to just use.

168
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.560
First I made a call and in another file.

169
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.670
So I will explain that code.

170
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.930
But due to time constraint, I'm not going to print.

171
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.020
It's very taking time, taking part.

172
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.840
So as you can see, it's HTML.

173
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.520
These are the HTML codes only.

174
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.170
Let me save this part.

175
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.590
So these are the codes only.

176
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.320
This is bootstrap CSS.

177
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.120
I'm adding in everything because for that purpose I told you for UI purpose.

178
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:34.800
Then this is all about the CSS thing over this with student login.

179
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:35.940
So.

180
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.500
What is this, this body tag?

181
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:47.140
And with this what I'm going to it's going to request dot to get parameter for the message part it's

182
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:54.380
showing the rate and this in the grid so this is all about the part for your username is invalid, your

183
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.370
username is valid.

184
00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:01.100
So after this part is done, I'm going to specify a message later to put this part.

185
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.060
So important part is this actually this is form action.

186
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:12.290
This is validated students and what is this is so I'm going to create that part with validated student.

187
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:19.430
So this action just I'm specifying this controller and everything, but I'm going to change that part

188
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:27.170
because for previous purpose I just created this, but later I will change that also.

189
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:35.100
So validate student and all things here you can change as your requirement.

190
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.970
So this is all about this and this is the location basically.

191
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.350
Now what is the location area which is basically on click event?

192
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.510
Or to exit that part.

193
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.290
So let us see what is deployed now.

194
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.650
Or let me open the door and click reload.

195
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.240
So let us go to the login page here.

196
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.310
So as you can see, our student login is done when I once I click exit.

197
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.460
What is happening?

198
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.700
It's going into the first page only.

199
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.160
Now let us log in again.

200
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.810
So it's not created for the page here.

201
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.410
So if you put name your this, it will show your user ID and password.

202
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.260
So this is all about the student logging in for their videos.

203
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:34.040
I'm going to tell you the JSP basics then how we can create administrative page also and some more information

204
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.780
about JSP.

205
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:43.670
And once JSP is done, I'm going to use some Java code also to validate, as you can see here, I'm

206
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.070
using directly this valid student.

207
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:52.730
So I have to use some methods value students and things to.

208
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.270
Create and validate that part also.
