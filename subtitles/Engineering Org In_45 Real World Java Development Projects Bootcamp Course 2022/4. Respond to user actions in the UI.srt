1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:08,680
Well, next thing we need to program the movement of the spots in this code will be letter calling,

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:16,690
letter via call callback, respond to the cursor movement so our game will support multiple move simultaneously.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,010
Those are three converted the best position on the screen in the.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,450
We get a version of empty tag and look for the direction of movement to support several of its movement

5
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,740
at the same time.

6
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,870
So what we will do?

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,190
Firstly, we have to take the constructor of our class.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,020
Under that, we will take the most listener event.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:53,560
So firstly, so we have not here, we need the private boolean and what we have taken the game over

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,840
this one, this variable.

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:08,810
So we have defined this and what we will do here we have true if the game over and false otherwise.

12
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,470
So this is done.

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,510
We need our variable by the name great size.

14
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:22,750
So here I will write private and name it as the grid size here.

15
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,440
So what we will do here?

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,710
I will create my constructor of class.

17
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,480
So I will write.

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,590
This can not be private.

19
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:44,290
So here I will write public game of 15 under this parameter constructor.

20
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,660
What will it be in size?

21
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,510
Comma in term, comma in margin.

22
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,750
So here I will write.

23
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,170
So we need margin also.

24
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,150
So private int and margin here.

25
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,720
Don't know what we will do and I will write the match.

26
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,180
Okay.

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,000
We need to distort size.

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,390
Initialize it to the size here.

29
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,880
After this, we need the dimension is equal to then.

30
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,750
And another thing which we have the margin equal to more.

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,520
Okay, so this is done.

32
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,540
Now what we will do, we will initialize the titles.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,930
Here.

34
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,630
Initialize.

35
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,570
No, it's here.

36
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:57,380
So we need annuitize, literally equal to size, multiplied by size, minus one.

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,910
Here, the minus one because we don't count blank tile.

38
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,790
Okay, so here.

39
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,130
Right it minus minus one because.

40
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,800
We don't.

41
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,320
We don't count blank.

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,800
Okay.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:36,830
So you take the diary which we have created now initialize the new int and under this we will write

44
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,290
size multiplied by size.

45
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,650
Okay.

46
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:49,220
So here mainly we have to program the movement of the spots in the array.

47
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:57,680
So here we will take we need the mouth, mouth listener because we respond to the cursor movement.

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,190
Right.

49
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,620
So what we will do.

50
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,810
Okay.

51
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,340
So we need.

52
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,300
Yeah.

53
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,080
After this we need.

54
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,350
And Mouse.

55
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,200
Listener Under this we will write mouse adapter.

56
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,730
This one.

57
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,340
Okay.

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,260
So no notice what we will we will write our logic.

59
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,740
We have to override the mouse breast event.

60
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:42,470
So here I will write public void and mouse.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,820
Trust.

62
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,290
We are overriding this matter.

63
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,490
So.

64
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,950
Right.

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,490
Mouse E went with the E.

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,930
So yeah.

67
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:10,120
This really used to let the users to interact on the grid migrating and we have to implement the interaction

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,140
with users to move tiles to solve the game.

69
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,290
Okay so here what we do.

70
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,450
I don't think it is the right

71
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,470
word right here.

72
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,200
We know what we will do.

73
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,020
Firstly, we will see we have to users to interact on the grid by clicking.

74
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,950
So we need the condition first of the game over.

75
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,910
So game under this we will call our new game, which we have created already.

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,470
And in that else part, what we will do.

77
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,200
We get the position of the click.

78
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:10,810
So here I will write in x is equal to e dot.

79
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,410
Get to x.

80
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,700
Get x.

81
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,310
It will be the machine.

82
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,260
Q Done this one and another one to get to Y.

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,540
So if y is equal to what you get.

84
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,910
Why take it with the machine here?

85
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,360
Okay.

86
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,710
So now we have to check it is click on the grid or not.

87
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,660
So click on click in the grid.

88
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,090
So here I will try to condition if.

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,450
If X is less then with the zero.

90
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:19,050
OD e x is greater than the grade size oc or imai is less than zero.

91
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,470
Or Eli is greater with the great size.

92
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,980
Okay.

93
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,490
So what do we do then?

94
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,800
Okay, now, another thing.

95
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,170
We have to get the pollution in the grid.

96
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,810
Get position in grid.

97
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,770
So here what we will take.

98
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,930
Position in the grid.

99
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:59,850
Now what we will do, we will take another variable by the name C, initialize it to the e x and there

100
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,710
I did with that tile size.

101
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,810
Tile size.

102
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,180
Take in r one which will refer to the row one.

103
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,630
It will go with the E divided by tile size.

104
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,210
So here, Don, now we have to get the position of the plant cell also.

105
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,940
So what we will do, we will take the C to set it to the.

106
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,980
Long position and more to the size here.

107
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:45,900
Now, another variable which we need is the order to set it to the blank position molded to the size.

108
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,910
Okay, so this none.

109
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,180
Now we have to convert another 1D coordination.

110
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,040
So here,

111
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,440
1D coordination.

112
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:11,310
So what we need, we need int and create a variable to expose.

113
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:25,840
Position two position which will take equal to r one multiplied with size and added to C column one.

114
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,500
Now we need another variable in the direction cited 2 to 0 here.

115
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,310
Now we search direction for multiple times at once.

116
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,950
So here I will take the research.

117
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,120
Medication for multiple items at once.

118
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,080
This one is done.

119
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,980
So we will take another if condition here.

120
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,820
We will check for the column.

121
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,520
One is equal to the column two and goes with the.

122
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:19,090
You need the math class and check it with the absolute of the R one minus R to so it will not take the

123
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,080
negative value and check it if it is greater than zero.

124
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,610
So what we have to do.

125
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,970
Zero.

126
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:42,100
Okay, so we will write the action is equal to r one minus r two.

127
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:51,260
Greater than zero and take the ternary loop.

128
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:58,340
Subtract its size, the minus size.

129
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,230
Okay.

130
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,230
Now we need another one.

131
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,600
Take the LCF.

132
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,490
Who would be the answer?

133
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,870
Look here.

134
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,190
We will check with the rule.

135
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:31,810
One is equal to rule two and not absolute and goes with the C one minus C two is greater than zero.

136
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,170
For the body.

137
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:45,170
The other direction is equal to C one minus C 2 to 0.

138
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,820
So what will it do?

139
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,220
Set with the one all cologne minus one hair the lot.

140
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,170
So another one which will last is the condition here we will take.

141
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,090
The direction is not equal to zero here.

142
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,670
We move twice in that direction.

143
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,730
So what we will do is take the collar jacket open.

144
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,350
Move piles in that direction first.

145
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,860
So what we will do, we will take a loop to do a loop here.

146
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,010
So under this, you will write.

147
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,980
What do we put in blank?

148
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,610
We need a new blank position.

149
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,310
Blank pose, which is cited to the blank.

150
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,990
Okay.

151
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
So this one.

152
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,320
Blank pools.

153
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,150
B, I are here.

154
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:02,800
Here.

155
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,770
I know what we have to do.

156
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,210
We have to take the tiles.

157
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,810
Right.

158
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:17,010
The blank pools here, which will initialize it to the tiles of new blank push.

159
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,610
So a new blank creation here.

160
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,240
And third, the blank position.

161
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:35,460
With your new blank position then not to do this no wine loop.

162
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:44,210
We will check the condition of blank, whose is not equal to.

163
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,400
Click pause Sudan.

164
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,050
And what we will do?

165
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:59,210
We will take the tiles array and set the blank position to zero.

166
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,980
Here this we have done.

167
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:10,130
Now we have to check of games on which we have created our material here.

168
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,840
This one is so sorry.

169
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,400
So what we will do here?

170
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,560
We have done.

171
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,030
Now we check.

172
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,040
The game is solid or not.

173
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,190
So take the game over variable.

174
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,690
Right.

175
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,360
It's a solid.

176
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,590
We need a solid here and now.

177
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,270
What we need our panel is here.

178
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:49,030
We will create our new master repaint, which will repaint the panel here.

179
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,390
Okay.

180
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,710
So this done.

181
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,100
And after this, we will call our method new.

182
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:21,840
So finally, we have programmed the moment of the sports daddy, this code, which we call a callback

183
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,820
to respond to cursor movement.

184
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,840
Our game will support multiple times simultaneously.

185
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,620
So those are converted the press position on the screen into a.

186
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:41,010
We get the position of the empty type and look for the direction of the movement to support several

187
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,620
of its movement at the same time.

188
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,050
So here we are converting that.

189
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:52,270
And this is all of our movement of the sports in a.
