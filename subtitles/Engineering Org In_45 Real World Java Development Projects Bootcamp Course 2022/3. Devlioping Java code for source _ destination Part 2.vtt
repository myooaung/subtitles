00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:10.860
So in previous scenario, I created this class, which is an IT monitoring Java or Java project program

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.050
and I said all the things here.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.830
Let me tell you why I changed this previous part.

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.150
I haven't specified this much more, but the thing is, our arguments in these string arguments which

5
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.550
are going to we are going to use the command line very clear.

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.480
It's not integer, it's always string, but we are considered into our port.

7
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.170
So for the utilize that part, I'm mentioning this as a integer and I'm assigning to the port.

8
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.630
If you are using string, it will not accept.

9
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.430
So for that purpose I change it to the integer value of that and it's acceptable to put like this in

10
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.300
arguments.

11
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.090
So I created one text connect.

12
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.940
So task which is time task basically.

13
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.970
And it's going to run here, public word run which is you can check your.

14
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.100
Just ask me run meter and I'm going to use all the things.

15
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.870
So now what I'm going to perform here is.

16
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.600
Right.

17
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.800
So inside this.

18
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.630
Let me put your catch on.

19
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.790
So with exception E if you know this part.

20
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.060
Let me.

21
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.170
System of.

22
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.140
Oh.

23
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.690
Got it.

24
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.400
So let me bring this up.

25
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.030
Now, we are going to go with tie in here.

26
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.670
So I'm going to create your own socket.

27
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.620
Socket as is equal to new socket.

28
00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:01.640
So soccer is nothing but as like our what we can say over an electrical socket.

29
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.920
We need to put our Java program or network or we are going to.

30
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.990
We just want to connect our Java program to the network.

31
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.890
So for that purpose, what we are going to perform, we are going to create one socket to put this in

32
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.580
our software.

33
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.370
So let me put here.

34
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.510
I need supplies.

35
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.500
I need.

36
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.980
Socket.

37
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:36.570
And so it is going to automatically detect with an open socket, not only in its socket address and

38
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.220
platform, which is just like source itis.

39
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.850
So let me put here.

40
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.370
Source address idea.

41
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.400
Source 80 is equal to new socket.

42
00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:03.890
And I want to mention here at this so source is outrageous if not zero zero so which is basically our

43
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.180
port.

44
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.610
So if you want to change this port, you can change.

45
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.750
So can put that here or in Haiti, which is basically common port.

46
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.680
Then our target is our new.

47
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.180
So I need to create one another software practice.

48
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.740
I need to operate this again with destination board.

49
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.510
With New.

50
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.700
No eye socket at this target slash hole dining.

51
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.090
So what our source you can consider, sources you can consider is our own source or you can give us

52
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:07.020
localhost 8080 5500 20, 25,000 which are very common polls people are using 88 is most common you can

53
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.220
check so source you can check it and target and time consuming.

54
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.960
So now we are done with this and Target is basically any performer I'm going to choose.

55
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:28.860
Now I need to perform this bind socket is I'm going to perform what socket it is so service and I'm

56
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.880
going to bind or I'm going to perform that socket.

57
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.530
Like in that electrical socket, you are not putting only the plug it connect it to the wire.

58
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.010
So in that whole wire I need to bind over my source actress.

59
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.370
So similarly I'm adding my source address, but you can check any source.

60
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.140
This here is not connect.

61
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.510
Destination.

62
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.420
I need to perform your destination with time out.

63
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.430
So I'm considering thousand seconds for our time.

64
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.210
If not connected, it will automatically put directly out of my thing.

65
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.890
If.

66
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.840
Connected in its need to frame some message.

67
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.390
So if connected is not.

68
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.400
It's.

69
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.960
It's connected.

70
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.490
If it's connected, it's is connected.

71
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.590
It's just brilliant thing.

72
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.800
If it's true, it's going to bring something so extreme dot, dot, print.

73
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.780
And what is going to print.

74
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:43.760
It's very interesting is I'm here when new date.

75
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.260
If you're familiar with this new date is nothing but date function.

76
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.160
Java is automatically copied.

77
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.890
As a ventricular net or.

78
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.970
Any to mention source and target everything.

79
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.560
So I need to do the space plus target.

80
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.920
I need to put here target, which is my target.

81
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:23.300
Then after this, I'm going to print my two slash, which is basically for.

82
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.220
All.

83
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.710
Plus, what I'm going to put here again is.

84
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.990
Whether it's connected or not.

85
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.550
If it's connected, it needs to print message connected.

86
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.580
Let's see what else.

87
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.370
Which is basically.

88
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.070
It's not.

89
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.190
It's disconnected.

90
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.770
It's going to print this similar dissimilarity message.

91
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.250
Disconnected.

92
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720
Okay.

93
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.440
So now we are done with this.

94
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.970
And let me put here one more line system.

95
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.820
Dot, dot.

96
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.360
Didn't.

97
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.460
Debase is not exists.

98
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.540
Slash.

99
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.200
Not going to.

100
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.910
You get?

101
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.910
Basically if I'm having the exception if this.

102
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.400
So that's it.

103
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.870
We perform.

104
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.710
So now let me tell you how we are going to run.

105
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.870
So first thing, what I'm going to create, I created here one socket.

106
00:07:51.870 --> 00:08:00.240
And this task is assigned to this time timer schedule with delay and we read everything but with source.

107
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.180
I'm going to mention which destination address and port I'm going to mention and you can check this.

108
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.440
So the checking part is very important here.

109
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.710
And let me tell you how we are going to perform this.

110
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:27.410
So you no need to execute directly in this way because our arguments is not shaped.

111
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:33.640
If you want to set arguments, you have to sit here as with these everything and you need to mention

112
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.630
that part.

113
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:41.740
But if you want to use command line interface, let me tell you how we are going to perform here.

114
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.270
Hope my seeing the command prompt is working.

115
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.830
Go to that directory, which is basically the source folder.

116
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.930
If you paint your java.

117
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.670
You can check.

118
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.350
This is my Java command.

119
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.510
So let me clear out this.

120
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:10.460
So I need to print this network monitor java so it will compile this part first.

121
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.550
So it will take time to compile everything.

122
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.570
Java.

123
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.330
So Java is for the compiling part.

124
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.090
If I printing this java now you need to use this java part.

125
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.240
Now what is remaining?

126
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.690
Things I needed here.

127
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:36.160
I needed here some old methods and I need to implement like our source is fixed but our target is not

128
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.670
fixed.

129
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.490
So I need to mention three targets here.

130
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:52.450
So 192.168.2 or one I'm considering here port is similar 8.8.8.8 which is basically Google with port

131
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:52.990
30.

132
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.140
So I'm mentioning this.

133
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.000
So this is my source.

134
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:10.260
So I don't know whether this address is not or these know why I'm getting by in exception, because

135
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.240
this address is not actually exist or which is not connected.

136
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.240
So I don't know whether this address is connected or not.

137
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.850
So for this purpose, I use this.

138
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.770
So let me move to the iPad and let me close this.

139
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.060
So let us check for one.

140
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.140
New here.

141
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.100
Using that moment from this.

142
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.990
So.

143
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.360
Let us check whether my own IP address or thing is connected or not.

144
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.460
You've got to see this.

145
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.390
Then again, these commands.

146
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.690
Java and I'm not considering here.

147
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.710
Okay.

148
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.530
One thing, I need to compile it again.

149
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.340
So remember, I need to compile it again.

150
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.400
Once it's compiled because I've changed a little bit.

151
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.550
So to compile it again, so it will take time to compile it.

152
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.180
Let me put here.

153
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.400
So this is my new IP address with new destination.

154
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.600
This is destination.

155
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.390
This is IP address.

156
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.650
And this 80.

157
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.120
80 is just basically for the connecting.

158
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.600
So currently on this date and this it's not live.

159
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.930
So let me close this first year here so.

160
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:56.140
What I'm going to perform here if I want you want to check your own IP, you can check.

161
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.930
But for the security purposes, I'm not considering here.

162
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.810
So I'm putting here when the random address.

163
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.250
And if you want to check whether this is connected to the network or not.

164
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.440
A 2021 date is basically Google IP.

165
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.460
You can take.

166
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:23.030
So I don't know whether this source, which is basically not my sauce.

167
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.490
So this is not also like you.

168
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.780
So you can check like this.

169
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:37.300
So it's similar like pink .8.8.8.8.

170
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.410
So you can check you are getting the reply from ping and everything.

171
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.250
So 8.8.8 just for Google Server.

172
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.360
So.

173
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.820
If you know the IP address of your target, target is basically the source.

174
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.460
You can check your part later.

175
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.950
So let me.

176
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:14.950
In this forum know one another IP and let me change this to a d board only.

177
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:15.430
But.

178
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.460
First you can check your own IP.

179
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:43.940
So I'm putting another random IP here and I'm going to check whether it's working or not.

180
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:09.120
Again.

181
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.720
Check your google TCP port or HTTP port also.

182
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.980
If you want to check.

183
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.930
Oh, let me consider that.

184
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.000
40.

185
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.190
So let me check whether it's working or not.

186
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.680
So this is one another random IP.

187
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.110
This is one Google IP.

188
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.690
And you can check whether this IP is live on this.

189
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.930
So, no, this IP is also not live.

190
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.870
So maybe there is error with this or this.

191
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.260
So this is very primary step, capturing the IP and performing this.

192
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:52.380
So in the next part, I'm going to tell you how we can work on different things here.

193
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.700
Hope you understand.

194
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.270
Thank you.
