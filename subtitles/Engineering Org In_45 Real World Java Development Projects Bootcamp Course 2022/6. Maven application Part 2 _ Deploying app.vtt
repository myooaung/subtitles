00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.330
So I already coded some part.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.470
And now I'm going to show you how we can perform this.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.590
So these are already done.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:20.310
In previous tutorial, I forgot to mention you need to install WP Cap, which is Windows Pcap application

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.560
which is available on the internet.

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.210
You need to install that part, otherwise it will not run.

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.860
Then what?

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.910
I'm going to tell you.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.130
I created this.

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.180
Everything.

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.030
Now, if.

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.210
Which device I want to choose.

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.940
I want to give that information.

14
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.900
Then I need to create one snapshot handling.

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.760
So what is the snapshot handling?

16
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.800
It's create one file out dot gap to perform and add in that file.

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.960
So it will add my listening posts and everything in this file file part.

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.810
So then I'm going to capture that part later in further video.

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.560
Further tutorials, I'm going to tell you how I'm going to capture that part.

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.100
So this is just handling and capturing the live package like I need to handle that package.

21
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.510
So for that purpose.

22
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.470
Or I'm going to handle these packets.

23
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.760
So let me check whether this outdoor pick up opener is.

24
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.740
So as you can see here, some packets are added here.

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.960
These are not in these.

26
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.390
But yeah, some packets are added.

27
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.930
So you can create different, different things.

28
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.270
Writing the files and everything.

29
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.410
But.

30
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.300
In law, you have to check whether it is listening to TCP port or not.

31
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.980
So my device is not currently listening to the TCP port, but if you can somehow implement this, you

32
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.400
can create this set to filter only.

33
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.610
Listen TCP packets on board for this.

34
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.990
If you create this HTTP, you will get the HTTP board.

35
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.890
So I will run this and I will tell you how it's going to work.

36
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.120
But.

37
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.960
Currently loading.

38
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.640
It will find out all the networking devices available on my site, on my system.

39
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.780
So it will take some time to load everything.

40
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.670
So now it's loaded and.

41
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.290
Who's going to provide the things for me.

42
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.830
So as you can see, these are my devices.

43
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.650
So I will tell you what is the exception for me is set handler.

44
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.630
Syntax error.

45
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.970
What is the syntax error?

46
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.330
You can download this source.

47
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.530
Set filter to this.

48
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.480
Why?

49
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.720
I haven't mentioned TB.

50
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.980
I should mention that PCP always.

51
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.410
So I hope you understand this part.

52
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.330
So not always the you have to listen to the people.

53
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.460
So I created this part and I put public video packet method here.

54
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.600
Then I created your max package to bring that part.

55
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.590
And package received, package dropped and everything part while the packet capturing and everything.

56
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.230
So my device is not currently connected to the network due to some issues like network issues, I am

57
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.850
not connected to the network.

58
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.590
So you may not find there are packets captured, but you have to check here everything.

59
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.840
So I hope you understand this part.

60
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.870
This is it for this project.

61
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:25.980
If you want to implement this part on your site, you can create when you are using swing and you can

62
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.910
implement this part.

63
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.050
Hope you understand.

64
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.010
Thank you.
