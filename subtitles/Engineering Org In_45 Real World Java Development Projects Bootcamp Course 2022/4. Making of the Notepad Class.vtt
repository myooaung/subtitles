00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.050
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:12.260
So after successfully creating the frame of the notepad, we are going to add icon to the.

3
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.140
Yes, I can do the noted down title one.

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.750
So invoking the Matildas image icon.

5
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.610
Naming the variable as icon, we have to set a new icon

6
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.710
for the notepad toolbar.

7
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.450
So the method to do this is get class first.

8
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.940
You get the class.

9
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.250
For the image, invoke it and get resources

10
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.230
from the folder itself.

11
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.780
So for setting the image, firstly, we have to put the image right here.

12
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.700
So yes, this is the notepad dot png.

13
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.320
I am going to.

14
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.090
At her.

15
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.470
So I have dragged it and now I'm going to use it.

16
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.710
The name is suggesting not being.

17
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.500
So the images added successfully.

18
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.620
Now, let us try to run the program.

19
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.870
So I'm running this program.

20
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.710
Let's suppose that I have said so.

21
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.010
Yes.

22
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.700
Perfect.

23
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.030
This is the icon we have set for the note down title one and on minimizing it.

24
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.330
The icon changes from the Java Cup coffee mug icon to this notepad icon.

25
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.230
So we have successfully set the icon for the notepad.

26
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.850
Now let us switch to creating the nav bar for this.

27
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:25.400
Like currently it has only a body and this title bar let us create a heading bar which will contain

28
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.330
button says file, edit, health and so on.

29
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.940
Now we are going to create a menu bar for this note down.

30
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:49.610
So to create the menu bar we have to use this library java string as it has a function for menu bar.

31
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.720
So, so menu bar from Java string.

32
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.860
Calling this and naming the method the menu bar.

33
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.590
Let's create a new G menu back.

34
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.860
Yes.

35
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.050
So then my new body is created successfully.

36
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:27.350
Now try to add some fields to the menu bar field so that the menu will contain support.

37
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.880
File.

38
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.160
File option.

39
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.050
View the menu file.

40
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.530
So, yes.

41
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.620
We have created.

42
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.310
Fine.

43
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.800
Let us try to run this again.

44
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.130
On running this.

45
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.460
So yes, this is now.

46
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.590
We have to add members to the menu if we want to see.

47
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.670
So below the constructor part we are going to call.

48
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.070
Add the menu by.

49
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.260
From the Java Wing Library itself.

50
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.480
No menu, but.

51
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.310
Stand by.

52
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.520
We are running fine to the minimum.

53
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.640
Now let us try to run this again.

54
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.620
Second running this part.

55
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.220
We have added file.

56
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.860
Now we have to move it to upwards as the heading part is on the top of the page, not in the middle

57
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.850
of somewhere.

58
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.240
So firstly, move it to adding some more things to the menu bar and then shifting it to the upwards.

59
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.330
So let us end and it can help option.

60
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.010
In a similar way.

61
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.090
We have ended file by copying the same and changing it to edit.

62
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.320
And help.

63
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.110
Yes.

64
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.050
Similarly replacing the string and humans pass inside this menu.

65
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.570
So.

66
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.200
Yes.

67
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.720
And after adding this.

68
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.780
Number.

69
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.310
No Dad ended.

70
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.290
Men maneuvered or tended.

71
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.040
So remember that that health.

72
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.860
Hmm.

73
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.780
So we have successfully added two more films to the menu.

74
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.990
And now we will try to run this again.

75
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:54.000
So yes, the fields are added to the menu, but now we will try to shift it towards our ports.

76
00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:03.150
So we have added it as add menu bar, but there is a separate method of adding menu bar.

77
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.470
So.

78
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.300
The meantime has set.

79
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.400
Jim and Uma.

80
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.120
Domain, Uma.

81
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.390
Now let us try to run this again and see what its output is.

82
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.380
So perfect.

83
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:43.130
We have added the menu bar we have behind it beneath the title and we have a file, edit and a help

84
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.820
button.

85
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:52.790
So currently they have no options attached, but we will try to add some options inside the file.

86
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.550
Edit and help.

87
00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:03.080
So let us minimize it and try adding some functions inside the file editor and help buttons.

88
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.030
Here we are adding

89
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.010
g menu bar items.

90
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.540
It is also from the library itself.

91
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.770
Now, item, let us call it a new file.

92
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.480
Suppose if we want to open a new file in the notepad.

93
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.980
So the option goes for.

94
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.550
The menu item will be.

95
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.490
Caldwell New.

96
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:59.860
Had we had, we have created a method for the file option as now let us add some more options in the

97
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.030
similar manner.

98
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.320
Let us address this as open file.

99
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.410
See file.

100
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.440
Then exit, as we have discussed in the introduction.

101
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.670
Then exit.

102
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.850
And replace it.

103
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.680
Pedro's so open.

104
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.000
Save.

105
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.850
Print.

106
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.400
And it also.

107
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:54.190
Now let us try to run this and see if the file button contains the given options or not.

108
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.610
So clicking on the file.

109
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.180
Okay.

110
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.070
So we have to add it.

111
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.350
In the constructor also.

112
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.340
So adding a tear.

113
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.100
Failed or dead.

114
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:19.400
Similarly that we have added items to the menubar like file, edit and help.

115
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:25.820
We have to add methods to this file button as well as new file.

116
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:36.480
And again, copying it five more times and pasting.

117
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:44.110
But open print exit and say so.

118
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.240
And open.

119
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.680
Save.

120
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.290
And.

121
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.830
It.

122
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.010
Exit?

123
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.960
Yes.

124
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.260
Not to change her.

125
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.750
This will remain.

126
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.750
And all of them.

127
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.080
Just change the argument inside that matter.

128
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.000
So let us try to run this again.

129
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.870
Running this code.

130
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.140
The notepad opens.

131
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.730
Yes.

132
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:54.380
And now we have new open save print and exit option for the file button in the menu bar.

133
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.570
Similarly, we will set something for edit and in the next part.

134
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:09.910
And then practice this better with your with your compiler and explore more about these buttons, the

135
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.470
frame and the panel.

136
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.930
See you all in the next part.
