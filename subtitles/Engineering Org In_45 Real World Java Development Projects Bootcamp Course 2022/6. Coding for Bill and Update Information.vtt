1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.240
So here's the calculate built on Java file which we have created inside the package electricity importing

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.560
the necessary packages.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.010
Now we have defined the class calculate by extending the frame and implementing implementing the action

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.930
listener interface.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.430
There are the five labels element L two, L three and l51 text field as d one and the choice instance

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.210
as even c two.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.650
Then the two buttons are there B1, B2 and a panel, which is a p.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.610
So inside the calculate build constructor.

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.270
We have defined the new panel as a new panel into the piece, setting the layout for the panel as well,

10
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.320
and background color of the panel.

11
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.670
Then we have initialize the label one as the name of current calculate electricity bill, setting the

12
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.870
bound for that label.

13
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.640
The second label as meter number setting the bound for that label.

14
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.770
Now the label six is as name setting the bound for the label six label seven as address setting the

15
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.560
bound for label seven and for the label three as unit consumed, setting the bound for the consumer

16
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.780
label five as month, setting the bound for the month.

17
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.600
And then there is a choice seven setting the bound for the choice.

18
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.520
Inside the choice we have created the connection drive, lock and four.

19
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.640
Inside that we have initialize the connection with our icon class.

20
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.470
Executing the query for select extract from customers will retrieve all the details of the customer,

21
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:43.050
and while it reiterates over the rows of the customer table in our database, it will add choices by

22
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.350
retrieving the meter number, so it will add the meter to the choice.

23
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.710
So even inside the choices, the meter of all the customers will be added.

24
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.080
Otherwise, if any exceptions occurs, then it will throw the exception using the catch block.

25
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.200
Now inside label, there is one variable label, and in this label we have set the bound for the label,

26
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.770
adding that label to the panel.

27
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.850
Then in the next label we have set the bound for the label and also added that to the panel.

28
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.720
Again, inside the try block we have initialized and called our connection class to establish the connection

29
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.360
with the database and results that we have executed.

30
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.090
The query from select aspect from customer where the meter number.

31
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.690
So this will retrieve the meter number from similar selected item.

32
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.200
So for the particular meter number which we will select from the selected choice for that meter number,

33
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.270
it will retrieve the record of that customer.

34
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.870
So for that records.

35
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:53.160
It will in the panel l label l11 it will store the name and it panel ll2 it will restore the address

36
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.990
of the Retrieved metal number.

37
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.330
Otherwise, if any exception occurs, then it will throw the exception using the catch block now seven

38
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.580
dot add item listener.

39
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.800
So in C when we have adding the item listener a listener bypassing its object and.

40
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.030
Public void items that change when an item is changed.

41
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.980
An item event.

42
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.240
We have passed this argument inside the try block.

43
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.130
We have initialized the connection.

44
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.190
Similarly, we have executed the query customer where the number is even selected item for the next.

45
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.220
We have added the string name and address onto that.

46
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.790
If any exception occurred, then we'll handle by the catch block.

47
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.110
Now in the new text field, 31 is a new text field we have set down for the T one and here is the C

48
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.530
two new choice which is for the month and the key to set the bound for the C2 and we have added all

49
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.540
the months in the set.

50
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.440
After that, there is a button named as summit setting the bound for the buttons.

51
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.260
We have set the bound for the B1 for the B2 named as cancel.

52
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.930
Set the bound for the B2.

53
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.990
There is a B1 and B2.

54
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.120
We have set colors for the B1, B2 background and foreground colors.

55
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.100
Then there is an image icon.

56
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.250
Which we have added into the L4.

57
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.140
Then we have set the font for the L1 and its alignment of L1.

58
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.510
Then we have added all the remaining labels choices.

59
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:34.300
Buttons and fields to our panel, setting the layout for the window by using model layout panel to the

60
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.280
center and label full to the best.

61
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.510
The label for is containing the image, so that will be aligned to the left of the panel.

62
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.390
Adding action listener to the buttons and setting the background of the window as white, setting the

63
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.400
size and the location of the window.

64
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.460
After that, there is an action performed method defined.

65
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.440
If the.

66
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.040
Event performed on the button.

67
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.990
Be one, then it will.

68
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.920
Store the meter number.

69
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.320
By selected items from the choice fun store units from the Demon Text Field get text store months from

70
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.210
the see to selected item.

71
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:24.370
Now it will calculate unit consumed and the percent units so you as units in a string format so it will

72
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.340
convert a typecast the string into the integer and store it into the variable units consumed.

73
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.920
Now we have initialize the total base equals to zero and now inside the drive log we have initialize

74
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.530
the connection again with the database by using our icon class.

75
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.470
Executing the query from select from tags.

76
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.540
We need to retrieve information from the tags to add those taxes in our build.

77
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.540
So over the rows for that access we will.

78
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.890
While our next total build is equal to units consumed, which we have entered taken from the text field

79
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.890
and can typecast it into integer unit consumes will be multiplied by the existing cost per unit, so

80
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:09.220
the cost per unit will be converted into typecast and into integer and multiplied with the unit consumed.

81
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.120
For example, if the 120 units are consumed by the customer and there are nine cost per unit, so that

82
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.480
will be multiplied again, the total will be added with the meter rent charge, service charge, service,

83
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.330
tax charge, such access charge and fixed tax.

84
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.380
So these are taxes will be involved in the total bill and the total will be calculated.

85
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:38.390
Then there is a string cue in which we have to add those values into our build table of the database.

86
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.790
So for that, we have created the query here using a string variable Q insert into values past that

87
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.370
necessary fields and the default status has not paid.

88
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.190
When it is paid, then we will change it to the paid.

89
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.710
Now try connection we have initialize connection again executed the string query Q shows that customer

90
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:06.110
build updated successfully and after that dialog box we have set the visibility of the current window.

91
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.120
Calculate window as follows If an exception occurred, then it will be handled by the catch block.

92
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.320
Now, if the event is performed by the B-2, then it will simply close the.

93
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.020
Calculate inside the main function, we have a calculator created to calculate, build, instance and

94
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.210
set the visibility for the window as true.

95
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.020
Now move to the update information.

96
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.630
Class.

97
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.390
It is also defined inside the package electricity.

98
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:45.420
Importing the necessary packages and defining the class with the text will 2233, 345, 36 and 37 labels

99
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:52.810
ll1l l1 l2 and buttons b1, b2 and a string meter update information is string meter passed, the argument

100
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.500
is meter.

101
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.530
So that will be an argument for the constructor.

102
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:02.740
And after that we have set bound for the window layout as null content, background as white and its

103
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:09.100
title as update customer information setting the bound for the title that is a label and title font,

104
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.070
family font type and font size.

105
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:20.260
Adding the title to the panel window J Label L1 Another label name bound for the label, adding that

106
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.210
label another label that's setting the bound for the label and adding that label label L2.

107
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.730
That is a meta number, setting the bound for it and adding it.

108
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:39.060
Then there is another label la 2l12, one, two setting the bound for that and adding that to the window.

109
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.000
Then the other label address setting the bound for that, adding it.

110
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.130
Similarly, there is a text field setting the bound for the text field and inadequate.

111
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.630
There is a city setting the bound for it and adding it.

112
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.580
So these are the fields which we can update, which can be updated.

113
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.590
So now there is a text field.

114
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:04.770
Data setting the bound for it, adding that data to the window label five has state similarly another

115
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.280
text field.

116
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.350
What is a state email list back to test field for email phone number respective test field for phone

117
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:18.420
number and button update its background color is black foreground color is white bounds setting the

118
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.610
bound, adding Excel and adding that button.

119
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.260
Similarly, for the B2, that is a back button doing the same things as B1.

120
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.050
Use for the back operation and adding that button to the window inside the ignition.

121
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.900
We have called the connection to connect from the database.

122
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.370
Select extract from customer may meet an invisible meter so it will select the details of the customer

123
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.820
where the meter number will be the meter value of the meter.

124
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:50.710
And next iterate over the rules of the customer and retrieve the information from the column sides.

125
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.640
One, two, three, four.

126
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.740
That will be set into the labels.

127
00:09:54.220 --> 00:10:04.630
One, two, l one, one, one, two and text 50 122 345 as respectively now catch it will catch block

128
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:11.470
will catch the exceptions image icon will be set with using another label l eight setting the bound

129
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.060
for the label, adding that label to the window.

130
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.860
No action performed inside.

131
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.040
If the event is performed by using the beyond button, then we will.

132
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.320
Store.

133
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:30.890
The text into our respective string as well as two as three as four as six of the values from the l11

134
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:37.520
11 to 2233 T 45 inside the tribal tribe block we have our connection.

135
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:45.710
We will execute update, query, update, customer, set address and we will set update by with the

136
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.310
using the respective string values passing to the.

137
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.510
Our query.

138
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.730
So this will show our details updated successfully and we will make the visibility of this window as

139
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.330
false.

140
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:03.210
After that catch exception will end the exception if the source is one way to that will be back button.

141
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:08.220
So this will simply make the visibility of this window as false inside the void main.

142
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.580
So we have updated the information and made call the instance of update information and set the visibility

143
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.510
for this to.
