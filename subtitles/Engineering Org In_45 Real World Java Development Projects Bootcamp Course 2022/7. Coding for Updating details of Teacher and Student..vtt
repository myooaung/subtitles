1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.390
So this here is our entire Master Java class, which is defined inside the package university and.

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.950
We imported the necessary package that is Java X dot swing, java .8.10.8. and Java.

3
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.560
Then we have defined our class enter max, which is extending frame and implementing actions.

4
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.540
Then there are four labels and approximately one.

5
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.910
11 text fields and one button.

6
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.100
Then there is a one parameterized constructor.

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.120
Enter Marks.

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.160
This is setting the size of the window, location of the window and layout as null.

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.020
Then there is a label.

10
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.930
In terms of trendsetting font for it family serif type bold size 30 setting the bound for it location

11
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.750
50 comma zero and sizes 500 Chorus 180 then adding that label to the frame similarly under the label

12
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.150
as rule number setting bound for it adding to the frame respect to text field for the marks of the student

13
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.140
setting bound for it and adding to the frames.

14
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.940
Similarly for the label as enter student.

15
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.400
Setting bounds of it, adding to that frame.

16
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.500
And similarly we have another label for intimate setting, bound for it ending with a flame.

17
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.450
Then we have the text fields or text field or data setting bound for it, adding the frame, another

18
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.100
text field three setting bound for it.

19
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.140
Adding to that our frame text field for add setting bound for it.

20
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.890
Adding it to that our frame text field five setting bound for it.

21
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.600
Adding it to our frame.

22
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.080
Then there is a text 56 setting bound for it, adding it to the frame 37 So doing the same thing to

23
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.930
it, also setting the bound and adding it to a frame.

24
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.430
D9 t ten.

25
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.270
T 11.

26
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.820
And then there is a.

27
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.900
But then submit labeled as setting bound for the button, which will help us to submit those marks into

28
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.010
our marks table.

29
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.980
Then setting the background color of.

30
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.590
The button setting.

31
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.830
The foreground color has white adding it to that button to over.

32
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.820
Window, adding the action to the button and adding setting the background colour of the window as white.

33
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.930
Then we are defined by action performed method action which is taking action.

34
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.220
Event Argument A if source of the button is from B1 stabilizing the connection con.

35
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.250
By using our token class, creating the query S1 instead into subject values.

36
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.370
So the subject column will be inserted into the subject column subjectively in our database, and max

37
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.220
values will be inserted into our max table.

38
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.160
C And executing the both query by the help of execute update method by using our constraint, by using

39
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.760
our connection instance and the statement instance.

40
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.430
Inside that connection, showing the dialog box that Max inserted successfully and then setting the

41
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.190
visibility of the current window as false, catching the exception, if any, occurs.

42
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.710
And inside the main function we have setup, we have called initialize the our intermix class with setting

43
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.210
the visibility as true.

44
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.040
Let's have a look and update the student Java class inside, define inside the package university and

45
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.920
import Java and importing Java SQL importing Java DOT Swing and the event class update is implementing

46
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.440
Excel list.

47
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.220
Now we have one frame and label.

48
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.760
There has multiple labels.

49
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.960
Text field, 14 text field and three buttons and a string as ID employ.

50
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.620
Update a student.

51
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.260
Added Flame is headed at updates in details, setting the size of the frame, location of the frame,

52
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.210
background, color of the frame, layout of the frame.

53
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.490
Then there is a label enter.

54
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.410
Rule number two update the date of the student setting the bound for it font for it, adding to the

55
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.990
frame respective text field for the roll number.

56
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.550
Then there is a button.

57
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.550
Update background color of it for one third of it bound for it, adding it to that frame and adding

58
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.050
extraneous net of the button.

59
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.890
Then there is another label as updated to name details.

60
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.120
Said, bound for it, fond of it, for adding it to the frame.

61
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.350
Then we have ID one another label as name bound for it, setting the font for it and adding it to the

62
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.460
frame to our.

63
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.520
Label that is ID one.

64
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.330
After that there is a text file T1 setting bound for it.

65
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.350
Adding it to that our frame under another label father's name setting bound for it, setting font for

66
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.640
it and adding the frame to our label.

67
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.560
And then there is a T2 text field setting bound for it, adding it to the frame.

68
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:14.690
Then there is another label as H setting bound for it, font for it, and adding it to a frame on the

69
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.890
text field as d three.

70
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:16.850
Setting bound for it.

71
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.400
Adding to it to that our frame.

72
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.140
Under the label as date of birth deed and by format bound for it font for it, adding that our frame

73
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.960
and the text field setting bound for it, adding that to our frame another label as address setting

74
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.380
bound for it font for it, adding that to our frame.

75
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.680
Then there is a text field setting bound for it, adding to adding that to our frame as well.

76
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.590
Similarly for the phone number label and respective text field for the phone number as well.

77
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.670
Then there is one for email ID and some respect to text field for the email ID then for the class 10th

78
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.850
marks label text field to enter class 10th marks.

79
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.680
I didn't.

80
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.490
Then there's control.

81
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.500
For the last 12 months.

82
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.590
There is a label, the spectral text field for the class 12 max.

83
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.100
For that number.

84
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.040
Text field for that number or roll number?

85
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.100
Text field for the respective label.

86
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.030
Then there is a course text field for the course.

87
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:45.210
Branch text field for the branch and the button submit background for one color bound and adding that

88
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.700
toolbar button under the brightness cancel.

89
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:56.970
Setting action is not of the those button setting the visibility of the current frame as through inside

90
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.590
the action performed method.

91
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.270
If the source is from the button, then we will stabilize the connection, create a query, update a

92
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.880
student, set name, get text, first name everything.

93
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.130
Creating the query by executing that update query showing the display was successfully updated, setting

94
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:21.840
the visibility of the current window as false and calling new student details back then.

95
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.840
After that, if it is from B2, we will close this window.

96
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.770
If it is from B2, then we will slow as a connection.

97
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.040
Select extract from a student variable number equal to this result.

98
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.470
As a result set as given the query and we will set the frame window as false.

99
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.500
True and add all the.

100
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.640
Records from the database into text fields then will be cast exception if any calls instead of visibility

101
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.860
as to sites and location of the frame.

102
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.580
Inside the main method, we have updated the strength and visibility as true.

103
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.480
Now let's have a look on our update feature class.

104
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.570
Define inside the package university.

105
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:14.110
Importing Java JWT as Java SQL Java X String Java JWT Event Update Implementing Extension.

106
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.580
Similarly, there are.

107
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.250
This is also similar class like update to student.

108
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.570
So everything you must be getting it up as we have just discussed.

109
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:28.630
Update straight update each class there is a frame setting everything for the frame, label and employee

110
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.620
ID to update the data respective test field for the employee ID.

111
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.230
Then there is a button update setting everything from the button for the button, then update teacher

112
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.020
details label for the teacher details.

113
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.770
Then there is a label for the name respective text filter intern name.

114
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:50.220
Then there is a label for the father's name, respective text field for the father's name, then the

115
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.570
label for the age.

116
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.800
Respect to text.

117
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.790
Field for the age.

118
00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:01.630
Unavailable date of birth suspected for the date of birth label address respect for the address.

119
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:07.020
Similarly, like we have discussed in our ad student class, then there is a phone number text field

120
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.610
for the phone number, email ID, text field for the email ID label class ten marks text field for the

121
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:13.420
10th marks.

122
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.400
Then there is a label.

123
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.960
Class 12th marks.

124
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.820
Text field for the 12th marks are the number.

125
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.640
Text field for the number employee ID label.

126
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.440
Text field for that employee ID label.

127
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.880
Education.

128
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.120
Respective text field for that education department.

129
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.590
Respect Specter text field for the department when there is a button, submit background setting everything

130
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.190
for that button.

131
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.500
Submit adding it to the frame.

132
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.980
Be one cancel button background for one bound for it.

133
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.380
Hiding exceptional the boat buttons setting the visibility of the frame as true.

134
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:59.390
Inside doesn't perform if the source is from be setting the connection, creating the query str and

135
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.460
convert assert execute update.

136
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:09.380
Still it will update execute the query successfully updated the dialog box visibility as false back

137
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.930
to the new teacher details class catching the session if any occurs if the source is from B1 sent center

138
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.060
visibility as false.

139
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.640
If the is from some way to button then it still has the connection a string as the pitcher will employ

140
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:31.530
it is fetching from that T1 to text field, executing the results set.

141
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.820
Retreating, fetching the next record, setting visibility of the current windows while setting the

142
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.420
text field.

143
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.510
Inside the text field, we are putting all the details.

144
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:53.200
Visibility has to set the size as 900 comma 650 location has for 50 command to 50 and public static

145
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.060
point I'm the teacher have not said this was true so these are the three classes that we have discussed.

146
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.960
Let's have a look at these three classes.

147
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.520
How they will look like.

148
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.740
I'll be running from the login class again.

149
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:09.800
Vitamin.

150
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.800
And when.

151
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:14.380
Logan.

152
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.400
Yep.

153
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.230
Let's examination.

154
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.290
What will the class siting into?

155
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.250
Master class.

156
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.610
Let me.

157
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:27.990
Yes.

158
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.210
In Damascus, Syria.

159
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.120
So in Damascus, click on in Damascus.

160
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.640
This will look like in Damascus.

161
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.320
So we will enter the rule number and everything, the subject and enter marks details.

162
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.480
Then insert the updated students.

163
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:48.440
This is the further updates when we will entering the rule number.

164
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.240
Then if we want to update, then we'll click on update.

165
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:58.140
So it will already show you all the details and we need to just add in those features we want to update.

166
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.070
If you want to enter manually, you can enter manually as well.

167
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.290
I'll be clicking on Cancel right now.

168
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.840
