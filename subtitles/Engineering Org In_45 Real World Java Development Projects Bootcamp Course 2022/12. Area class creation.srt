1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,080
So here we will create the area class.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,110
It is the object on which we try to please the packages here.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,500
So it should extend our mean that is actor class first.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,510
Under that we have to create its constructor.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:32,730
So here I will create a matter initial area and then we will create that method first.

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,010
Now what do we have to do?

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,680
Firstly, same thing.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,500
We have to set the image icon here.

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,820
So just simply write image icon on.

10
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:58,440
Give the part authority resources or not be unclear.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,870
Right.

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,960
Image.

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:09,830
Image is equal to I can not get image here and simply said the image also.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,030
And so this is our area class.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,610
It is the object on which we try to please the packages.

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:27,690
And now the next and the last part which we have to do is to create the so called one third Java.

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,970
This will be our main class, which will give our output on the window.
