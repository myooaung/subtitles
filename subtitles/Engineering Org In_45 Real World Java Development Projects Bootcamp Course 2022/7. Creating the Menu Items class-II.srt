1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,680
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:11,020
So till then, we have covered everything about the beverage, glass and coffee class and added everything

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,820
to the label.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:19,110
Plus, we just have to attach the action to the events attached in the class.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,990
So in order to make the things clear, firstly we have to create the juice, tea and water class.

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:32,890
Then only we can attach the actions to the label class, which is going to be responsible for testing

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,510
and running of the application.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:43,420
So our next concern should be creating a new file inside the SRT folder, which will be called as Juice

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,440
dot Java.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:52,690
So we have landed inside the juice file and this is containing a juice class.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,940
So inside this juice class, we are going to create like objects private.

12
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:08,610
String and the flute like juices has flavor.

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:17,030
We have already discussed it in the working section, so private string flute and the flute is going

14
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:25,700
to be a string array basically, which is going to contain the types of the flute, which could be the

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,560
flavors of the juice, of course.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:38,420
So a flute and this string called flute is going to contain three fruits in the beginning and that are

17
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,150
going to be suppose Apple.

18
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,790
And then an orange.

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,340
Okay, so it is right in that manner.

20
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,670
Double string.

21
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,330
So an orange and a pineapple.

22
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,190
Or should we have a look at it?

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,160
So changing this to double codes.

24
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:12,830
So the elements of the fruit is apple, orange and pineapple.

25
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,580
And the indexes of these are going to be zero, one and two, respectively.

26
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:28,070
So after the creation of this juice class and extending it to the beverage class, as we are going to

27
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:36,830
use the methods inside the beverage class, we have used the get and set method for this, only to make

28
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,100
use of that class inside another class.

29
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:48,410
So the get set method is used for that only to access private objects inside any other classes of the

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,200
folder.

31
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,960
So we have started it already.

32
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:58,430
Now we have declared the string, after which we have declared this juice object.

33
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:05,460
And the arguments inside the juice object is string size, integer, amount and label.

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,990
So these three are the same arguments as we have done inside the coffee class.

35
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:21,860
The difference inside the juice class is only that we have options like we are using the combo box,

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,630
like our option pin.

37
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,740
We can see that.

38
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,380
So option pane is displayed.

39
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,440
When we run the thing, we choose juice and then we add it to card.

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,760
Then our option pane appears asking for selecting of fruit.

41
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,930
So we have to select a fruit or as a flavor of our juice in order to complete the order.

42
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:54,230
So this try and catch will be responsible for exception handling like any kind of error.

43
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,290
If arises, then it will be cast inside the null pointer exception.

44
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:08,780
You have to select a flavor if you click no like do not select any flavor and cancel the dialog box,

45
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:16,790
then automatically the exception will be thrown that choose any of the flavors and then only you can

46
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,960
add it to CART.

47
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,540
So try inside this.

48
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,220
Try we are adding option pane and the label is containing a string.

49
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,870
Select our fruit.

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,630
So select the fruit and a question message is being a pear asking for a fruit.

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:42,890
So the option pane will be containing this fruit array head this fruit string array containing three

52
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,100
fruits, apple, orange and pineapple.

53
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,420
And by default the fruit will be displayed at the index.

54
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,300
At the index we have apple, so that apple will be displayed by default.

55
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:02,540
And you can choose it any, any way, like any of the three fruits you can choose.

56
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:10,820
Now, in the similar way we have done it for the coffee class, we have our side a double price and

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,140
we have our dedicated price for all the three sizes.

58
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,740
But in the juice we have three fruits.

59
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,220
Also, like there we had milk.

60
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,370
So in this we are having flavors.

61
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,610
So by default the flavor is apple.

62
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,130
So this five and seven and nine is the price for the apple juice.

63
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,590
Plus small apple juice is costing five.

64
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:44,600
Similarly, the medium one costs seven, as if not choosing the small and medium definitely will be

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,970
choosing the large glass.

66
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:54,770
So the price is going to be nine or and suppose if you are choosing orange and pineapple, then the

67
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,410
price is going to be multiplied with 1.25.

68
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:06,380
In those like dedicated classes, suppose you are choosing a small orange juice glass and then the price

69
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,110
is going to be multiplied with 1.25.

70
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,740
And for the pineapple, the size of the price is going to be multiplied with 1.5.

71
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,080
Similarly, the set price is used to set the like update the price.

72
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,760
Once you change your mind like adding two more glasses of coffee, then this set price method is used

73
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,220
to update this price later.

74
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,820
Okay, so this is done till now.

75
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,420
Now in the similar way of adding strings like a text.

76
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,990
In the form of string.

77
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:52,260
We have prize as a double and a amount as integer, so we have to convert all the text into a form of

78
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,920
a string.

79
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:02,220
So we are using this two string function calling the super dot to string to convert fruit juice to display

80
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:09,030
here like suppose we have choose the apple juice so it will be displayed that our five glasses of apple

81
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,440
juice is added.

82
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,990
So yes, this is responsible for converting everything in the form of a string now so that we have created

83
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,080
juice, glass, coffee, glass, beverage, glass.

84
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:30,450
Now our next concern should be creating a new file inside the RC folder and naming it as Java.

85
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:40,170
So this class is going to be responsible for adding of the functionalities of the P option in the menu

86
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,650
bar.

87
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:54,540
So this will be like initialize the public sorry private boolean or sugar and then and that sugar is

88
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,040
going to be the add on for the p option in the menu.

89
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:10,710
Now inside this, we are going to make a constructor call it as C and the arguments are going to be

90
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:20,310
string size, int amount and label B L in the similar way we have done it for the juice and the coffee

91
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,000
class.

92
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,840
So the constructor is created successfully.

93
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:34,950
Now inside this, in the similar way we'll be adding a super method and the super method will be containing

94
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:49,020
size and amount for the P and if statement will ask for whether we want to like attach sugar to our

95
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,040
tea or not.

96
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,350
So j option pane.

97
00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:02,190
Dot a dialog box will appear asking for like whether we want to add and the parent component is going

98
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:12,660
to be the LP end and the message is going to be like, would you like to add sugar or something like

99
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:12,960
this?

100
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,360
So what, you like sugar?

101
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,490
Yes, it goes well.

102
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,790
What do you like, sugar in your tea?

103
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,980
Would you like sugar?

104
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,240
A question mark should be attached.

105
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,320
And after this sugar.

106
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,330
Okay.

107
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:45,750
So our option pane will appear after this, asking for like a better yes or no option.

108
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,940
So j option pane again dot yes.

109
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,010
No option.

110
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,590
We are going to select it from the suggestions.

111
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,840
So yes, no option.

112
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,580
We are going to add.

113
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,930
And this is going to be set as.

114
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,810
None in default.

115
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:18,580
And if this if statements is true, then the sugar boolean objective will be set to true in the beginning.

116
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,520
As if this is not true.

117
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,470
Then we will like change sugar to false like initially.

118
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,640
So what is.

119
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,670
False by default.

120
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,280
Now.

121
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,330
So that.

122
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,380
Okay.

123
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,910
So the double code is required for this also.

124
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,960
Now after this.

125
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:51,130
Now, in the similar way we are concerned, adding prices to the tea with sugar and without sugar.

126
00:10:51,140 --> 00:11:01,130
So calling double prize here, if size equals small, the price for the is going to be 3.0 elseif.

127
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,070
Thus, if the size is medium, then the price for the t is going to be four.

128
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:14,690
And if we have not choosed small and medium then there is only one size left which is large.

129
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,710
So definitely for the large the prize is going to be five.

130
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,290
Now what if sugar is added?

131
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:27,530
So if and this boolean sugar is going to change itself to true and false.

132
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:34,970
So if true, like if sugar is present, sugar is added, then the price is going to be multiplied with

133
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,350
1.25.

134
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:46,790
And suppose we have choose the like the small size D, then three is going to be multiplied with 1.25

135
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,480
and the price is going to be 3.75.

136
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:59,840
So that total label report will show that you have added a small cup of tea and the price is 3.75 with

137
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,290
sugar.

138
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,800
So we have updated the price.

139
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,100
So according to the sizes we have changed.

140
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,960
Similarly, we have done it for the coffee and the juice class.

141
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,480
We are converting string and like other data types in the form of string.

142
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,690
So suppose if sugar returns super to string then divide with sugar.

143
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:33,290
So I suppose if we added sugar then we have to display that five glasses of five small glasses of P

144
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,510
is added with sugar.

145
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,260
So this is going to convert things in the form of string.

146
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,970
We have already like mentioned it in the previous classes also now so that we have covered everything

147
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,660
about the juice coffee beverage classes.

148
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:58,220
Now in the next part we will be covering about what the water class is going to be responsible for,

149
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,460
what is going to be the prices for all the size of what is going to be the, I don't think, attached

150
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,540
to water class.

151
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:13,820
And later on we will be adding like the action attached to every event inside the label class.

152
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:21,020
So yes, this is exactly we are going to do in the next part we will be creating the water class and

153
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,870
then concluding everything inside the label class.

154
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:31,070
