1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:11,210
So we already look out this part, which is basically we created the one controller, part two handling

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,260
the controlling part.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,010
So let me do one thing.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,070
Let me close all these things.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,620
We created one controller to perform the controlling actions, as you can see here.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,400
Is for the controlling all the things we created.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:35,740
One, the model which is handling the GPA part in the repository, this is the repository to store the

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,710
JPEG files and everything it's going to create.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,340
As you can see here, this is auto wired things now in the services.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:53,470
I created one service with list which is going to scroll in that list with some gate, all employee

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,300
save and all the things here.

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:02,320
And this is one another method which is implementing this interface as a class here and which is calling

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,510
all those things and putting the data here.

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,740
And this is my main method which is going to run and doing everything.

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,620
So as you know, this is the stuff I'm going to create, but I haven't mentioned how we can create the

16
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,400
database.

17
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,680
So that's the.

18
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,650
Come back in part here then.

19
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,840
Now let us see.

20
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,920
I created one front in part also.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:37,630
So go to resources here, as you can see, go to the resources tab and here resources in this then go

22
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:44,830
to the templates, create one folder directory templates and create these three HTML files.

23
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,830
So I will explain what are these three HTML files here?

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,990
First is in html.

25
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:59,140
Remember the loading should be indexed dot html always type with team leaf as my ex html thing here

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,350
with head employ management system I'm mentioning.

27
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:10,690
Then this is the stylesheet I'm mentioning which is bootstrap stylesheet with some SHA256 integrity.

28
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,430
You can check online that part.

29
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,550
I'm mentioning the employee list employees list with the show new employee form current page.

30
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,470
So these are the team for each of things I'm accessing here.

31
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,680
Then list of employees, total pages and current page I'm mentioning.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,310
If your page is exceeding more than this in the new employee, it's very simple again form which save

33
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,290
employee as my thing.

34
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:44,590
Then I'm mentioning this and update employee for the updating part I'm going to create here.

35
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,040
It's truly, as you can see here, this is for the updating part.

36
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,700
So these are the all the things related to how I created the front end part here.

37
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,350
So you can use these directly and these things are very important.

38
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,920
The same employee I'm accessing the methods with the objects.

39
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,870
So remember the annotations, dollars, symbols, then sometimes stars.

40
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:15,160
You need to find the hidden part with text and controller and I'm giving the button with some this class

41
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,670
which is already default in this stack but with bootstrap BCD and you can check here with the back of

42
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,830
home page by the slash page.

43
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,510
So that's it I created.

44
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,360
So let us see how we can create one database here.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,800
So for the database, what you needed, you needed one.

46
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,540
My skill workbench.

47
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,530
I'm using my skill thing so it's very important.

48
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,070
You should need by my skill or otherwise you can choose your software.

49
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,830
You need localhost server because I'm accessing the localhost database only here.

50
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,260
So let us see how we can create here.

51
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,400
So let me create one database first.

52
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,940
Here, create.

53
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,660
Database.

54
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,760
So it will give me the database here.

55
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm mentioning as employee.

56
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,460
So employee is my database.

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,390
Use database I need to mention here or you can use directly or also employee.

58
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,120
So I'm accessing that employee.

59
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,000
Yet.

60
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm using that employee, so I'm not accessing again and again.

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,090
I'm going to deploy it directly.

62
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,390
I'm not accessing it again and again.

63
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,760
So I'm mentioning now create table.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,090
So.

65
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,260
Merely table name as MP.

66
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,930
With this.

67
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,110
If you know the scale, you should use this.

68
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,650
Or idem mentioning with end.

69
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,370
Not.

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,930
NULL.

71
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,420
But I am mentioning the primary key, as you can see, primary key.

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,630
Let me move this primary key.

73
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,820
I'm going to mention.

74
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,060
Or to increment so or to increment for the increment purpose.

75
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,050
Default.

76
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,830
Now, I need to mention first name here.

77
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,770
And remember why I'm putting first name as this.

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,470
So if you go to the ID part and just look out your model thing.

79
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,290
Model the employee part here.

80
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,630
So this name and this name, the column name should be similar.

81
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,470
So I need to create assigned data source later.

82
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,020
But remember this name and column name should be same.

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,590
So for that purpose I'm mentioning this column name and I'm mentioning as a character.

84
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,600
So let me mention worker here.

85
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,140
Worker, let me mention this.

86
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,250
Or you can say string.

87
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,080
So I'm putting this knot in alignment and putting here not.

88
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,560
Then again, last name.

89
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,450
We were together.

90
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,120
Let me mention for you 500.

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,490
So it's very useful and I'm not giving the normal constraint here and email I am again giving the normal

92
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:21,060
constraint so it will again work and it's then not null.

93
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:31,900
So this is all you need to create regarding to skill sequel and with the creation of database and everything.

94
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,520
This is administration part and go to the schemas to choose this path.

95
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,650
So select all this and hit the that script of everything.

96
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,090
So it's lightning icon.

97
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:49,360
So in the output thing you can check all the outputs are currently creating and all the outputs are

98
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,880
created, but we cannot see the schemas here.

99
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,670
So just right click here and click refresh all.

100
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,210
Once you refresh all you can check your our database is here and it's showing me the all the things

101
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,310
ID email name.

102
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,360
It shows me the foreign keys also indexes so indexes is basically primary key and mentioning so everything

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,470
is now created.

104
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,480
So now you are you can close this because we don't require this MySQL.

105
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:24,340
So the later part how I'm going to tell you how I'm going to work with this let us move to ID so if

106
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:33,310
you closely look, we created this, I assume that we already created the database and we are accessing,

107
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:39,400
but we haven't mentioned what accessing I'm giving I'm not mentioning the properties here.

108
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,790
So for that purpose we need one properties part.

109
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:50,950
So properties are nothing but you can say like accessing and giving that unique database identities.

110
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,230
So.

111
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,170
Let me go to the application properties here.

112
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
Distinct application properties.

113
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,400
And let me mention so it's not like it's property.

114
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,750
So it's very simple.

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:15,860
My SQL database, I'm going to mention first my SQL database as my application properties in that I'm

116
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,990
mentioning first DB name.

117
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,860
So now.

118
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,950
Instead this db.

119
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,900
It's very easy spring.

120
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,250
Not data source and dimension.

121
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,790
So data source.

122
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,750
Lord, you are ill.

123
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,400
So these are the default things you need to mention.

124
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,430
Data source url.

125
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,550
Now remember while you are in gdb see again it's a java database connected only dot.

126
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,720
I guess you have to use semicolon.

127
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,170
Yes.

128
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:55,610
Simple.

129
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,120
In my SQL, I'm accessing the skilled database.

130
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,550
Then local host.

131
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,730
Because my mind is placed on localhost at least to check for yours.

132
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,100
Link.

133
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:20,170
3306 is the default port number of my SQL 3306 and your database name.

134
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,940
So my database name is employee.

135
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,060
As I told you, you need to mention the data source you are first.

136
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,320
Now you need to mention the driver plus name.

137
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,030
So it's really easy.

138
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,260
Again.

139
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,860
Spring River class name.

140
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,480
And wait a minute.

141
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,000
I forgot to mention this.

142
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,380
Okay.

143
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,010
Spinning Dot.

144
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,740
Driver or.

145
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,970
Data source driver class name, basically.

146
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:50,940
Or.

147
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,750
So, Michael, C.J., you need to mention C.J., not remember this.

148
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,220
You need to always give the C.J. thing, not your defaulting.

149
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,350
Then spring again.

150
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,250
Not.

151
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,960
Again this spring.

152
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,640
Data Source username.

153
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,540
You need to check.

154
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,180
So let me put your actual data.

155
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,450
So don't you use a name?

156
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,380
Username.

157
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,260
So for me the username is rude.

158
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,030
And Spring board data.

159
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,130
So it's not password, basically.

160
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,490
Not.

161
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,670
This isn't my password for my database.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,910
So we created this, but I haven't mentioned the spring JP property, so you need to mention the JP

163
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,210
properties also here.

164
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,230
So.

165
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,940
Hibernate GP a proper PS you need to mention here.

166
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,300
So first properties spring.

167
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,850
So.

168
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,140
Expanding GPA.

169
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,180
Also you need to mention the strategy and everything here.

170
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,590
So properties don't have properties.

171
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,410
Dot.

172
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,490
I don't think you should mention, but.

173
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,270
Let me check whether it's there or not.

174
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,150
Okay.

175
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,220
Not to mention the spring hibernate.

176
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,870
Dilate my skull, which is basically my skin dilating.

177
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,190
So.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,100
Spring proper.

179
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:45,990
These.

180
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,510
BGP properties dot you need to mention the data source basically.

181
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,110
So.

182
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,630
Data is not property.

183
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,790
So let me do one thing.

184
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,990
Database.

185
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,730
If we check database platform and it's my my SQL.

186
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,520
So you need to mention this hibernate.

187
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,050
Then I'm accessing some default things here.

188
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,600
So let me tell you, what is these things?

189
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,660
So these things you need to mention in the application properties, this is for the DB and accessing

190
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:39,050
the DB part here and this is for the putting the JPA and putting in the these things with the and it's

191
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,470
going to create a scale, show scale and everything here also.

192
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,130
So that's about how we can perform this.

193
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,860
So let us check how I'm going to deploy this.

194
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
So deployment is very easy.

195
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,070
Go to this.

196
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,490
It's actually already loaded in on the top here.

197
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,140
Also, you can run on this also, but you can click this top.

198
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,600
So this is the first time building.

199
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,630
So for the first time building, it will take time to build everything.

200
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,670
You can check your block also.

201
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,910
So let us check blog and let us check how it's going to work.

202
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,770
Ford is currently running the task and it's going to perform.

203
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,210
So it will take time to build.

204
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,480
The beautiful thing about this, it will not access the not used libraries.

205
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,980
It will not taken in the part of that.

206
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:37,380
So as you can see, it's passing the Java, it's creating the model and it's checking the compilation

207
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,090
pattern build is not successful.

208
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,250
Now the thing is, in the run part, run console part.

209
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,990
You can check or it will default in the spring here.

210
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,420
Now.

211
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,610
It will create some things and it will check here.

212
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,360
So wait for some time to create different things.

213
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,850
So now my program is finished.

214
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,470
I am going to tell you we need to mention some auto factory research things here.

215
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,390
So.

216
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,070
Let me check one thing here.

217
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:12,610
Okay.

218
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,460
So springboard application debug is enabled.

219
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,100
So we need to display that part also and with the entity managing factor also.

220
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,990
So we will definitely not going to do that.

221
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,330
So let us check who.

222
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,830
I'm going to change that part here.

223
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,460
So maybe there is one error with dot XML.

224
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,110
That's why it's giving me the error.

225
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,210
Sometimes dependencies are not involved directly.

226
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:51,620
So let me move to the XML.

227
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,100
So if you are.

228
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,400
No.

229
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,690
No.

230
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,990
This part you can check here, but.

231
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,270
Let me put here again.

232
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,760
So it will analyze the bar.

233
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,030
It's in the scoping text and everything.

234
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,450
Well, again, you can check here.

235
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,530
It's currently loading.

236
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,670
So again, use the time to perform these actions.

237
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,960
So as you're going to see, it's the.

238
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,640
Different, different things.

239
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,560
So this is the post PostgreSQL.

240
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,380
So I don't need that dependency.

241
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,250
Then this is the springboard.

242
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:03,870
The team.

243
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,770
I did all the things.

244
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,320
Snapshots I'm adding.

245
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,090
Okay.

246
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,600
Now let us.

247
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,860
But then this command line again.

248
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,770
And let us have a look.

249
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,020
What is the different?

250
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,420
What is the spring errors?

251
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,300
I'm getting here?

252
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,090
So XML will minimize this.

253
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,930
So let us check whether it's going to minimize or not.

254
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,200
Okay.

255
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,170
I found the error, basically.

256
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,780
So let me one stop this build part.

257
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,190
So it's very common error.

258
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,700
You need to give the just this thing to.

259
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,380
You that look local part.

260
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,540
So let me do it again.

261
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,400
So remember, this is your URL.

262
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,590
You can check on that.

263
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,770
My skill workbench also, if it's giving the error.

264
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,440
Now, it will deploy it very beautifully.

265
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,730
As I told you in the spring, but also it will deploy directly.

266
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,400
Now, the spring is now running spring application.

267
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,710
So wait for some time to boot up the spring spring boot.

268
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:43,950
Ignore these errors because my hot spot 64 bit and it's deprecated to JDK 13 but I'm using another JDK

269
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,620
so there is maybe sometimes.

270
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,710
So as you can see, my software is now started.

271
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:57,160
It's giving the time configuration indexes, it's creating all these things with context part but with

272
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,190
now you can check here.

273
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,960
Let me show you

274
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,700
here also.

275
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,970
It's giving all the details with the Web interfaces and all the things default.

276
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,360
It's loaded on localhost 88 directly.

277
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,080
Now it's currently running and you can check here.

278
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,790
Port is 88.

279
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,040
It's always the local host.

280
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,820
So Tomcat is already started.

281
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,870
My web server.

282
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,810
So your thing is just basically go to your any browser.

283
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,960
I'm on Chrome.

284
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:39,280
They peer localhost 88 and hit enter.

285
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,450
So wait for some time.

286
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,820
It will load the pot.

287
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,840
Now this is my employ management system, as I told you then in this I need to mention first add employee

288
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,290
I need to add the employee.

289
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:06,330
So let me mention name as John employee last name as James or let me mention as ah so ah John.

290
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,630
Or Dot John the.

291
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,110
Gmail.com.

292
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,780
Let me hit the save button.

293
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,140
As you can see, I'm going to this part.

294
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,480
So you will ask whether this is added on database or not.

295
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,320
So for that purpose, let me show you.

296
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,090
It's already added in the database.

297
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,060
So for that purpose, I'm going to access my my skill workbench.

298
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,130
So you can check your update.

299
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,700
But also.

300
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,190
So I need to mention as John.

301
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,310
Not are.

302
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,680
Its name is John.

303
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,440
You.

304
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,390
So let me change this, John.

305
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,040
You.

306
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,570
An update.

307
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,170
You can check here.

308
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,190
It's updated.

309
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,810
You can check your delete part also.

310
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:55,540
So first, let us see whether it's added on the database or is just catching from the catcher part or

311
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,350
the list part.

312
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,930
So for that purpose, go to your my skill workbench.

313
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,610
This is my.

314
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,790
Defaulting.

315
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,010
Connect to local instance.

316
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,210
My.

317
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,200
This is my root server.

318
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,840
So it is opening me.

319
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,700
The route server is opening for me.

320
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,110
So we had for some time.

321
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,810
So it will check whether my action is correct.

322
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,610
Yes, my action is connected and you can check your your.

323
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,830
This thing is already stored here already.

324
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:32,610
So I don't want this part because I already created the database and I don't want this.

325
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,810
So now what I needed, I needed to select start from.

326
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,940
MP This is my table.

327
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,470
So this is my table.

328
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,320
So I need to mention and let me execute this.

329
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:56,640
And so as in this you can check here or this ID is already created form you can check here.

330
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,230
This is my ID, John.

331
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,460
You, you and you.

332
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,580
John at Gmail is already added for me.

333
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,690
So let me go to the chrome again and let me delete this part.

334
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,610
So as you can see, there is nothing here.

335
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,850
And let me go to this again and let me execute this command line again.

336
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:19,870
You can check.

337
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,870
There is nothing here.

338
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:26,580
So my the defaulting is now working, and I'm working with the database.

339
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,230
If you want to add it again, just go to your ADD employees.

340
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,690
Now, I'm going to mention as James.

341
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,490
G.

342
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,860
Then J.

343
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,420
James J.

344
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,540
Andrade gmail.com.

345
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,890
I'm going to mention I'm doing the same so as you can see is added.

346
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,020
And if I go to the my skill workbench again, if I enter it again.

347
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,290
So you can check.

348
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:57,450
So let me tell you why it's putting the two here, because it's on auto increment.

349
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:04,590
So it will auto increment by default if you want to give that ID, not default the ID part.

350
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,740
So you need to mention that later.

351
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,980
But due to auto increment you need you are getting this.

352
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,080
So that's it about this project.

353
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,490
So let me give one overview about this.

354
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,580
What I created is just let me turn off this.

355
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,480
So I created the application properties.

356
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,090
You need to mention you are here with the class.

357
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:32,040
Name this driver name with the user username with the password.

358
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,530
Now the GPU properties with these.

359
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,670
So these things with updates on part two, these things come out.

360
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,680
XML is also important thing here.

361
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,700
So that's it.

362
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,760
You need to create.

363
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,250
So hope you understand.

364
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,100
And we created this project employee service.

365
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,380
So what you can do, you can deploy this employee service with some another database using PostgreSQL

366
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,410
on Heroku also available.

367
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,340
So this is the basic structure.

368
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,890
But while deploying on this, you should remember you need to change this application properties with

369
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,140
username, password, driver and URL.

370
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,570
Also, what you need to change.

371
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,410
You need to change the XML dependencies.

372
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,500
You need to add that dependencies like PostgreSQL dependencies here.

373
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,360
So that's available on that documentation part also.

374
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
Hope you understand.

375
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:22,940
Thank you.
