00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.690
So when inside this video, we will be having a look at the library of this project.

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.050
That is a cab booking system.

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.150
So let me run this first login file.

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.920
So I'll be running this file here.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.100
So that's how the login page will look like.

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.300
I'll be minimizing my ID in the background.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.140
I'll be having my my scale command line.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.460
So before logging into it, let's check what inside our database and table.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.020
So the, the database was used CBS one and let me show you the tables.

10
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.090
These were the tables so that a username and password details must be inside the account table.

11
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.890
So let me show you the details and account table.

12
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.840
These are the details inside the account table.

13
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.180
So I have already added one user and it's name password detail.

14
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.770
So let me first sign up so that we can add another account in our account table.

15
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.150
So I'll be signing up.

16
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.490
So I'll click on sign up button here.

17
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.410

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.590
I'll be writing user name as user to name as name to.

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.110
It's password as let's suppose.

20
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.750
Be a.

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.390

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.980
Now I'll be logging logging into this account with the same password and username, which I have just

30
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.610
created.

31
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.820
So the username was user two.

32
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.030

33
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.140
I like clicking on logging, so I have successfully logged in.

34
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.450
So before logging in let me show you that we can also.
