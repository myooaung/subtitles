1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,380
No.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,830
The last condition to stop the game or to just keep playing when the user or the computer reach at the

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,870
five score.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,220
So here we will take the condition.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,080
If.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,540
Your wins is equal to five or.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,160
Computer wins is equal to five.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,570
What we will do.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,470
We will take a hint.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,600
Yes.

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,420
No.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,300
Okay.

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,260
So we will take a yes no and store.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:56,150
No, we need we need to, we need to go with the option.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,870
Right.

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,940
So we will write G option.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,210
We need to show a confirm dialog first.

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,450
So here we will write.

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,650
We need the three parameters.

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,080
So we will take this one and here we will give null.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:18,230
So it will come in the center of the window and give the message here.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,800
The new game.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,660
Okay.

24
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,800
Right.

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,900
We will give this plea again.

26
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,230
Last one.

27
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,790
Here.

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:55,030
The option will be our G option being not yes, no option.

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,660
And done so.

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,890
Okay.

31
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,940
So here you will write.

32
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,950
If.

33
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,440
Okay, we have to take the result in our variable also.

34
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,670
So here will give the name.

35
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,010
Yes.

36
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,850
No is equal to.

37
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,490
So if.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,490
Yes.

39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,080
No.

40
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,530
Is equal to zero.

41
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:40,660
So what do I do to change Apple Computer not set icon with none.

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,310
And when we said label.

43
00:02:46,250 --> 00:03:01,850
And you, Lord said Pinecone, that no part on your wings is equal to zero and computer wings also equal

44
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,930
to zero.

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:12,560
Near the Chili Bowl score by your score, not subtext.

46
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:22,730
Give the parameter to string value and search it with your rules, which we have initialized with the

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,550
zero here and again.

48
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,690
Same goes with the computer score.

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,740
So here.

50
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,730
Computer score.

51
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,560
Dot set.

52
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,240
Text string note values.

53
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,450
Right of here.

54
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,600
The computer.

55
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,640
School.

56
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,630
We need computer rules.

57
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,840
So here, don't simply run our program here.

58
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,210
So here, take the questions.

59
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,940
So 108, the paper Scissor one one.

60
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,120
Now The Scissor versus Rogue.

61
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,910
One, two.

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,170
Paper versus rock.

63
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:19,070
Two, two rock versus a32 rock versus rock draw.

64
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,090
Simply here we get the result.

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,200
Rock and.

66
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,650
All courses through four to last one there.

67
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,300
Okay.

68
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,560
So here's the paperwork versus is of for three and the last condition is the scissor versus paper.

69
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,960
So we have the score five three.

70
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,150
So user wins.

71
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,210
So it will ask play a new party or whatever.

72
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,200
So simply press no, it will keep just being.

73
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,340
Then again ask.

74
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,360
So yes.

75
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,570
And it.

76
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,400
So this is our program.
