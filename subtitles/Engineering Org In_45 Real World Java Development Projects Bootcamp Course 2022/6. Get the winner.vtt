1
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:14.530
Now we will create a function to kind of score or get to design or create the winner beside the winners

2
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.920
also.

3
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.860
So here we will write create a function that the winner.

4
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.160
So here we will take.

5
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.680
Okay.

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.570
So we have some conditions.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.760
We will check for some conditions.

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.550
Firstly, if the player and the computer moves are the same, then the game is tired.

9
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.530
So simply we will print the draw and else if we have under three conditions.

10
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.320
Firstly, if player run the computer more different than the three cases are possible.

11
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.350
First one if the player movies rock and the computer movies paper, then computer wins.

12
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.450
If the player movies rock and the computer movies scissors, then the player wins.

13
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.500
And the second one will be the player movies, people in the computer, movies, teasers.

14
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.800
Then the computer event and the player movies, paper and the computer movies flop and the player wins.

15
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.800
And the third one, which will be the last one, if the player movies, scissors and the computer is

16
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.900
rock, then the computer wins.

17
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.300
If player movies, scissors and the computer movies paper than the player wins.

18
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:37.890
So what we will do, firstly, we will write our matter and under this we will check for these conditions.

19
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.970
So here we will simply write public or get winner on the test.

20
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.060
We will take the parameter with the string you on string computer.

21
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.970
But this under this matter, we will check the first condition of Trump.

22
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.950
So here we will write.

23
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.640
If.

24
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.370
You not equals computer.

25
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.180
Here.

26
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.790
What do we have?

27
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.130
Okay.

28
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.940
Okay.

29
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.770
So here.

30
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.240
The condition will drop.

31
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.440
Simply, we will draw.

32
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.530
Now we have another three conditions.

33
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.850
So we will write this if you

34
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.940
you sorry write you dot equals.

35
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.370
And here we have the first condition of rock.

36
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.430
And this we will check if computer.

37
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.280
Okay.

38
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.890
So your computer not equals to Caesar.

39
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.970
Right.

40
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.530
So if the rock versus Caesar.

41
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.650
So obviously the rock will be the winner.

42
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.870
So here we will increment the score of user because the user has to rock.

43
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:54.550
So it will increment and simply set the text on label your score, not set x.

44
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:05.710
Simply write string key and note this we will write a string or the value of

45
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.190
your events or ends.

46
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.960
What do we have?

47
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:26.020
We have the computer scoring element and bring the score with the G label.

48
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.640
Computer school taught set text.

49
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.110
Right.

50
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.840
A string or the value of.

51
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.910
Computers and.

52
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.590
And now we have some second conditions.

53
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.220
So what we will write is if and notice, we will write.

54
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.340
You don't equals.

55
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.720
Here we have.

56
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.850
The next condition is paper.

57
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.980
So here we will write.

58
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.640
If.

59
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.580
Computer dot equals.

60
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.210
Rock on voters.

61
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.950
What do they have to do?

62
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.390
We really increment the your winds.

63
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.610
Done and simply printed with the label.

64
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.590
Your score not set.

65
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:50.780
Text this we will write the string note value off and need your rinse done or else computer wins an

66
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.170
increment score and printed with the label.

67
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:08.080
Computer school don't sat text under this you will write string not value of computer wins.

68
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.970
And now we we will check for the last condition for the raw paper, and thus the last one will be the

69
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.720
scissor part.

70
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:29.680
So here we will write else if you are not equals with the scissor part.

71
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.040
So here what we will do.

72
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.770
And we will write

73
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.070
the story.

74
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.390
We will check with the paper part.

75
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.490
So what we will write is.

76
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.250
Puter nerd equals.

77
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.770
Look people here, the user will win.

78
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.260
Your wins plus plus done in Chile will not.

79
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:23.720
Julie Neal, the charter school board said next spring not value of changes with the organs and or else

80
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.680
part of will be computer computers.

81
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:42.340
Then increment this the level of computer school and not text and this we will write a string node value

82
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.100
of computer.

83
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.920
Is this done to school?

84
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.320
Here, then.

85
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.530
The old man's computer.

86
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.770
Okay, so this part is done now.

87
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.170
We simply run our program here.

88
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.470
No mistake.

89
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:11.880
You're not all this matter here in our manuscript.

90
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.800
Even so, what we have to do.

91
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.170
We have to write the law.

92
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:30.240
This drug will be seen and here the parameter will be random selection.

93
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.660
Same with no.

94
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.070
We promote, click here.

95
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.110
We will write that winner.

96
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:46.910
Give the people your next barometer will be the selection.

97
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.420
Seems to suggest here we will right get winner.

98
00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:05.730
They get scissor and another one will be random selection and now simply run our program.

99
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:24.580
Q So simply, we have the schools also here, the symbol for the rock, and this one is for Caesar as

100
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.520
well as for people.

101
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.240
So rock versus Caesar.

102
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.080
Same.

103
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.180
But we will take the paper.

104
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.330
So paper versus Caesar.

105
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.550
So the computer wins.

106
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.620
I will take the seasonal theme again.

107
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.130
So here, Caesar versus rock.

108
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.520
So computer wins.

109
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.530
Now I will take the rock.

110
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.020
So rock versus Caesar.

111
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:55.840
So user wins and paper versus Caesar.

112
00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:01.300
So the computer wins and this even goes on.
