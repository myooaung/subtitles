00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.440
So what?

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.880
Previously we have done.

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.710
We have done here.

4
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.890
Here we.

5
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
Each of the cells can be surrounded up to eight cells.

6
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.000
So this will not apply to the border cells.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.030
So we raise the number for adjacent cells for each of the randomly placed mind.

8
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:27.660
Now in our example, we add on to the top number of the cell in the question and now in the find empty

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.770
cells matter, we find results if the player clicks on a mind cell.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.080
The game is over.

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.400
So he no effort to play on a.

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.090
The game will be over.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:50.520
But if he she clicks on a cell and listen to the mind, he or she uncovers a number indicating how many

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.580
minds the cell is adjacent to.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.950
So playing on an empty cell, this one empty cell.

16
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.680
So plus cells with a number that form a border border around the space of empty border.

17
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.070
So we use a recursive algorithm to find empty cells here.

18
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.400
These are the recursive examples.

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.870
So in this call we check here, all in this one.

20
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.390
So what we have done in these codes, we check the cell that is located to left to an empty cell in

21
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.870
the question, if it is not empty, it is uncovered.

22
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.880
But if it is empty, we repeat the whole process by recursively calling a fine empty cell this one method.

23
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.280
So we have done with this part.

24
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.180
Now we have to create our method print component, which will turn numbers into images.

25
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.330
So here what we will do after three.

26
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:10.110
Yeah, after this one we will write here we will write public void field component and put the parameter

27
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.420
with the graphics g curly bracket open.

28
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:25.350
And under this we will start with the variable int and name, this name that uncovered.

29
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.910
So take in uncovered and here we will initialize it to the zero.

30
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.970
Here it will be the local variable of course.

31
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.040
Now we will take a for loop.

32
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:54.990
Here it is equal to zero and I will be less than to the number of okay, so I'm here to listen to a

33
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:03.270
number of rows and it will be the increment post increment under this we need another for loop with

34
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.740
the j variable.

35
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.360
Start with the zero.

36
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.750
Here g should be less than the number of columns of course.

37
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.930
And after this we need.

38
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.130
Jean remained here.

39
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.060
And now what we will do, we will take in cell variable, which will be equal to the field array.

40
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:35.660
And under this we will write I is multiplied with the and we need the columns and it will be.

41
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.440
So it should be in parentheses.

42
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.120
Who in the parentheses and should we end up with the G?

43
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:59.290
And now we need a condition here if in game and cell is equal to mine cell.

44
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.170
So here's what we will do.

45
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.240
We will set the in-game variable to the false, of course.

46
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.680
False.

47
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.400
Done.

48
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.070
And after that, we have to turn the numbers into images.

49
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.030
So if the game is over and we lost, we should all uncover the mines, if any, and show all wrongly

50
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.920
marked cells, if any.

51
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:32.660
So here we will take the another if condition here and right.

52
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.790
Not in the game.

53
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:46.620
And after in this commission we will take the first sell is equal to cold mindset.

54
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.340
So what it will do, it will say equal to draw mine.

55
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.360
Draw my lantern.

56
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.630
And another condition will be else.

57
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.290
If.

58
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.070
And that certainly is true equal to the mob mindset here.

59
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.690
We will do that thing.

60
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.100
Now we need to send it to the cell draw marker and done.

61
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.230
And now what do we do?

62
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.100
We will need another elusive condition here.

63
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.760
We will see.

64
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.350
Cell is greater than the mine cell.

65
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:40.460
So here we will do our part and send the cell variable equal to draw wrong.

66
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.120
Mark.

67
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.730
And then.

68
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.650
Now we need another last condition.

69
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.300
And if.

70
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.310
Sun is greater than mine cell.

71
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.480
So what we will do here?

72
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.970
I will write cell is equal to draw on draw cover.

73
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.250
Okay, so.

74
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.660
And the last one condition will be okay, we need that last condition.

75
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:18.970
In the last part here, we will take another if condition with cell is greater than covered.

76
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.250
Mindful ritual, see said, is equal to drama.

77
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.980
Grown mark here, which we do.

78
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.060
So here we need another sense of condition here.

79
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.250
And then we have to take cells greater than myself or not.

80
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:47.790
Here and here, human rights is equal to draw.

81
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:56.000
Okay, so we will set it to the draw and then take the ongoing variable to increment that.

82
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.500
Okay.

83
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.280
So here we have done.

84
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.470
If the game is over, we win lost.

85
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.560
We should all in on mindset, any and all wrongly marked cells if any.

86
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.560
So what we have to do, we should be cool.

87
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.420
We have to draw every cell on the window.

88
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.970
So what we will do?

89
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.880
We have to write a code here.

90
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.870
Theme

91
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.560
in this.

92
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.670
So here we will write Jean or drawing each.

93
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.870
Okay.

94
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.070
We don't try and take.

95
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.940
It's true.

96
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:59.440
These and the image of the cell here comma under parentheses we will write g multiplied and the cell

97
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.330
size here comma.

98
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.970
And after that take parenthesis.

99
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:12.400
Under that we will write I multiplied and the cell side, of course.

100
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.720
And then third these parentheses.

101
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.990
We will take this done so here.

102
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.640
Okay.

103
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.440
So what have we done?

104
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.820
This code.

105
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.870
This code line draws every cell on the window here.

106
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:56.330
So what we will do now, we have to check if there is nothing left to uncover.

107
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.220
We will.

108
00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.480
If the in-game variable was set to false, we have lost.

109
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.470
So what do we have to do?

110
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.610
We have to write a code for that.

111
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.740
So after this, we will take a condition here.

112
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:23.700
If a statement and write on cover is equal to zero and in the game.

113
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.220
So.

114
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.880
Here.

115
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.250
What we did in the game is equal to false.

116
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.930
Then we have to take the status for we will.

117
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:47.970
So, Dexter, of course, here we will say the text.

118
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.380
C Jim Vaughan.

119
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.930
Or else if here.

120
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:05.290
We will take this not in reverse and in game here.

121
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.450
I will take the status.

122
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.230
What?

123
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.900
Smart label and set text to the game lost.

124
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.710
Of course.

125
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.450
Game Lost.

126
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.370
And done.

127
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.830
Okay.

128
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.750
Change to endgame here.

129
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:39.830
And so if there is nothing left to uncover, we will have the endgame variable set forth we have lost.

130
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.600
So this what is done.

131
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.200
Now we have to take the mouse breast method which will react to mouse clicks.

132
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.790
So the minesweeper game will be controlled solely by mouse.

133
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.480
So we react to left and right mouse clicks.
