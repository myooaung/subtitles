00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.860
So in this video we will talk about and know the line by line implementation and explanation of these

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.340
classes that is add product and search product.

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.580
So at product class will be used to add any product by the admin into that stock table.

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.020
So let's have a look in this code for that add product class.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.080
So we have defined this class inside the package store and we have imported the necessary package like

6
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.050
point font which will be used.

7
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.860
To adjust and manage, set the font for that labels and text fields.

8
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.480
After that there is a single button which will help us to add any button to our frame.

9
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.560
Then there is a single label which will help us to add any label into our frame or window.

10
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.040
Then there's the Java export single menu, which will help us to add any menu or similarly for that

11
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.000
menu item.

12
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.400
Then there's a panel which will help us to add a panel to our window, then the scroll panel, which

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.860
will help us to add a scrolling whenever we needed any scroll.

14
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.740
Horizontally or vertically.

15
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.880
Then there is a text area which will help us to add text area to our.

16
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.100
A window.

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.770
Then there is a text field which will help us to add a text field to enter or take a record from the

18
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.340
user.

19
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.730
Then there is a combo box which will help us to add details or list of details in the combo box.

20
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.920
Then there is the action listener, which will be help us to perform an event over the buttons or menu

21
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.310
items.

22
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:44.910
Similarly, action event which will be the event or object which will help us to check from which button

23
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.890
or menu item the event has occurred.

24
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.960
Similarly for the colour will help us to set the colour for any label or text.

25
00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.020
Then we have defined our class add product, which is extending panel inside which we have initialized

26
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.950
or defined our text field variable like ID field.

27
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.700
And then there's a text area variable like DSC field.

28
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.830
Then there is another text field.

29
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.400
Quan Quan Field named as Quan Field.

30
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.140
And there is another label error.

31
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.910
We have a combo box of a string type company and the three strings ID detail and comp.

32
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.050
Then there is A and Q and variable and the string error is stored as enter product ID and quantity.

33
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.120
Now we have defined the.

34
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.770
Non parameterized constructor of this class, setting the layout as null.

35
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.250
After that we have set the bound for the frame which rules location will be 100 from 100 and its size

36
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.210
will be eight 4619.

37
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.090
Then we have defined the label named as ad product and we have set the bound for that label as location

38
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.820
as 328, comma 45 and size as 115 cross 21.

39
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.280
Then we have set the font for that.

40
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.190
Label a font family, font type and font size.

41
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.850
After that, we have added that label to our frame.

42
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.790
Similarly, we have defined another label.

43
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.260
Named as product ID.

44
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.050
We have defined the font type family and size for that label, setting the bound for it whose location

45
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.900
will be 246 101 36 and its size will be 124 close 21.

46
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.440
Then we have added a label to our frame.

47
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.410
After that, we have defined the label as product details, setting the font for that product detail

48
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.540
label and bound for that.

49
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:52.740
Whose location will be 246 comma 168 and the size will be 139 cross 21 Then we have defined the ID field,

50
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.470
which is the text field and setting bound for it for 49, comma one, 37 and sizes 136 cross 20 added

51
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.670
that ID field to the frame and then set the column for that ID field.

52
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.690
After that, we have defined our another free text area variable and set the bound for it is location

53
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:21.300
449 comma 168 and its size will be 136 cross 58 added that to our frame.

54
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:28.680
After that there is a scroll panel we have defined over the text area so that we have defined the scroll

55
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.040
panel over the text area so that the text area can be scrolled.

56
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.590
We have set the bound for that scroll panel whose size will be 449 168 and.

57
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.850
That will be the location and sizes.

58
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.290
136 Class 58 added that a scroll panel to our frame as well.

59
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.310
Then we have defined the label company setting the font for that label font family is Tahoma plane type

60
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.680
is plane and it's size is 14.

61
00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.440
Setting the bond for that label to 46 comma to 41 will be the location and size will be 124 plus 21,

62
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.730
adding that label to our frame.

63
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.780
After that, we have defined the button add product.

64
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.200
So as it is a button, it must handle an event.

65
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.070
So for that we have performed or define the action performed method.

66
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:21.990
So inside, which is if the text field of quantity is null or the text field of ID is null, then we

67
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.340
will show the error message.

68
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.500
And if none of them is null, then we will be fetching the ID.

69
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.400
With the help of get text method in our ID string quantity from the get text method from the can fill

70
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.790
the label and convert it into type, costing it into integer and storing it into our corn field.

71
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:52.850
Then there is we will store the details of the about the product and storing it our variable detail

72
00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:00.560
field a string which is a string type of variable detail with the help of text method then storing the

73
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.910
well detail or value of the company with by using get selected item.

74
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.130
To the company a string variable.

75
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.620
Then we will call the DB to add product to DB.

76
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:21.180
So this is the method of our DB class, which we have discussed earlier or earlier, and which is taking

77
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.030
argument as ID detail, company and quantity.

78
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.970
So this will add the product to our database.

79
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.750
And then we have said the text field and text to null of all the fields.

80
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.190
After that, we have set the bond for that button.

81
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:45.210
The location will be 449 comer 334 and it size will be 136 class 23 and we have added the button to

82
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.700
our frame.

83
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.270
After that we have defined the text field for the corn field.

84
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.900
So and bound for that for 49 comma to 74 and sizes 136 cross 20.

85
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.610
Then we have added that also to our j frame.

86
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.590
After that we have defined the label quantity which is items available, setting the font for it bound

87
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.230
for it with location 246, comma 273 and sizes 124 cross 21.

88
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.510
After that we have added that label quantity to our frame.

89
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.940
Then there is a combo box for the company setting bond for it for 14 and comma to 43 will be the location

90
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.860
and 136 comma 20.

91
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.550
Will be its size.

92
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.650
So then we have added that also to our frame.

93
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:32.160
Then there is an error label, error label for setting foreground color as red and bound and error that

94
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.210
label to over frame.

95
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.090
Then we have added items inside our company box, combo box.

96
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.900
These items are general matter and drugs and noise and electrical.

97
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:49.230
So these will be the type of the products sorry, type of the companies as they are.

98
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.570
These are inside the company combo box.

99
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.870
So this is all about the add product free class.

100
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.840
Let's have a look at the search product class.

101
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:04.070
So search product class is also defined inside the package is stored will be used to search any product

102
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:13.640
imported the necessary package like import java font swing button label panel, scroll panel, text

103
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.810
area text field color excel is not in action even after that.

104
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.500
We have.

105
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.380
Defined our class, which is extending the panel.

106
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.130
Gitex feel.

107
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:26.870
I feel.

108
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.080
Then there is a button.

109
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:34.080
Button, such a private label error and the listing ID cross error is goes to enter product ID.

110
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.440
Then inside our non parameter constructor we have set the layout of the frame as null.

111
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.300
Bound of the famous location will be hundred column 100 and size will be eight 4619.

112
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.100
Then we have defined the label.

113
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:54.650
Renamed as such product, setting the bond for it and setting the font, family type and size for it,

114
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.180
adding that label to our frame.

115
00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.970
After that, we have defined another label as product ID and the setting font for it, bound for it

116
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.140
and adding that product.

117
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.210
To our frame.

118
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.160
After that, we have defined the field, which is a text field setting up bound for it and adding that

119
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.030
to our frame.

120
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.340
After that, we have set the.

121
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.810
Maximum number of characters in that text field, which will be ten.

122
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.440
Then we have to find a button named as such as this is a button.

123
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.790
So this will also handle the events for handling when we have defined the public void action performed

124
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.750
which is taking argument action event which type of action event that is.

125
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.190
E So if either of the ID text field is null, we will show the error message.

126
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.840
If the default is not null, then we will call the isto.

127
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:46.280
First of all, we will store the ID field text of the field in our string variable ID.

128
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:51.710
Then we will be calling the search product method, which we have discussed in our discussion of the

129
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.880
Java file.

130
00:09:52.970 --> 00:10:00.920
So that method will be called with the bypassing the argument ID as the argument for that product for

131
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.660
that product ID.

132
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.830
And this debate, what such product method will fetch the details of that particular product?

133
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.890
After that, we have defined the bound for that button and added that button to a frame.

134
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.590
At last we have defined the properties for the error label and added that label to our frame also.

135
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.880
So these are the two classes with respect to the products.

136
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.040
First Class will help us add product to add the product in our database.

137
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:36.760
And second, when such product will help us to search the product and its product ID and its number

138
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.690
of quantities.

139
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.860
So this is all about these two classes and that's all in this.
