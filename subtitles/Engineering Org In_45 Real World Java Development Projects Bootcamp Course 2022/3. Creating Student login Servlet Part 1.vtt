WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.320
In previous part, we have already set up our project.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.150
We already created one in HTML and some bootstrap CSS with CSS also as you can see.

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.540
So we need to create one JSP for student login and for admin login so you can use your HTML also.

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.360
But if I am using JSP, handling with JSP is very simple, also very convenient and you can customize

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.500
it easily.

6
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.610
So I'm going to with this student log in page first.

7
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.310
As I told you, I already created this part.

8
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.550
Let me show you the student login method.

9
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.030
So all these things are HTML tags.

10
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.290
As you can see, these are the HTML tags.

11
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.920
These to this tell this also because this is already cases but not HTML part.

12
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.980
So I don't want to include another CSS file here.

13
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.670
So I just embedded style thing here inside Java or HTML or JSP page only.

14
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.280
You can easily use CSS, HTML plus Java using this.

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.880
So this will be very helpful to create a student login page as I created already.

16
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
So this is basically link with style sheets and everything as you can see.

17
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.020
And this is titled Student Login.

18
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.990
So main part is about all these things.

19
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.900
So it will print this student log in and everything.

20
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.600
Font color is red, for which part?

21
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.420
So if I am going to specify message to this message letter, but what I'm doing, this request dot parameter

22
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.690
is basically the there is something anomaly like for username or password are different.

23
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
It will show that that user demand passwords are incorrect.

24
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.560
So for that purpose, we can use this part.

25
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.350
So for displaying this, you can use Java program.

26
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020
I'm using your Java program inside.

27
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.580
So it is JSP page similarly for welcome or something message.

28
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.740
I can put this using JSP.

29
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.000
I did this.

30
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.890
So this is another form section I used here.

31
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.000
So as you can see, this is valid student.

32
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.410
If I want to use default package and I will not mention this part of dot controller.

33
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.190
But what I'm going to do, I'm going to create some packages inside on learning examination system package.

34
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.690
So why I'm doing this?

35
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.790
Because for the database fetching and executing data, I will create another for student and admin both

36
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.360
different.

37
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.110
So let's then for validate students and validate admins.

38
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.700
I'm going to create another things for this purpose.

39
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.550
I'm going to take one another servlet also.

40
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.420
So it will create tremendous amount of what we can see.

41
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.310
So let's so using default package, it's not very helpful.

42
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.360
Why for the managing purpose, book fixing and everything.

43
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.840
So for the nice project management, you should create packages within them.

44
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.920
So packages meaningful.

45
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.190
So packages you can create.

46
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.740
So what is the controller contents?

47
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.610
Controller contents.

48
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.990
All the controlling parts like log in page, signup page, validate page, everything.

49
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.900
So I mentioned it here later.

50
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.460
I will create this part with method post and I created one for username which is always remember this

51
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.330
should be meaningful part and password is if I click exit it should go to index attachment, otherwise

52
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.480
it will go to the login part.

53
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.520
Invalidates warranties.

54
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.910
Correct.

55
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.010
So this is all about these things.

56
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.840
So we are done with student loan, then admin log in JSP, which is basically similar to the student

57
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.460
login.

58
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.010
But remember here is the admin login with some another message I'm going to print and action is validate

59
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.520
admin.

60
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.280
So let us see what is the basics of JSP?

61
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.950
So JSP, as I told you, is nothing but Java language inside a HTML page.

62
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.840
So JSP is used to create web applications just like servlet technology, and it's very useful.

63
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.990
As you can see, I just can connect the Java program, insert the HTML to request dot get parameter.

64
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:23.820
So as you can see if you know the Java servlet part, if that request dot parameter is null, it should

65
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.840
print that value.

66
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.840
So its language is similar like Java, but there are some different tags as you can see.

67
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.590
So what is the advantages of GSP?

68
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:43.440
Our advantages of GSP is basically extension to the Java solids so we can use all the features of so

69
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.400
let's in JSP.

70
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.770
In addition, you can create implicit object, predefined tags, expression, language.

71
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.230
You can also use HTML, CSS.

72
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.320
As you can see, I just created stylesheet inside GSP only so you can do easy to maintain because JSP

73
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.580
is easily managed because we can easily separate our business logic with presentation logic.

74
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.360
So business logic is basically backend presentation logging is basically us.

75
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.630
So you can choose very mix over things.

76
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.750
But in servlet what is things?

77
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:23.490
In doing so it is only pure for business and with presentation, so it makes the business logical.

78
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.580
So in presentation logic also fast development.

79
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.660
No need to recompile and redeploy if JSP pages is modified.

80
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.580
We don't need to redeploy, read, compile all the project, but servlet codes need to update it again

81
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.750
and again and recompiled.

82
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.930
So here for this project we are going to create.

83
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.860
So let's also end.

84
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:51.030
JSP So consider while using the JSP, no need to redeploy it again, but for the solid part you have

85
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.980
to redeploy, recompile everything.

86
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.590
So you will see that I'm re compiling and rebuilding the project again and again.

87
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.810
But it just for the Soviet codes.

88
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.390
So what is the lifecycle of JSP page?

89
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.320
So if you know the lifecycle of Java, it's similar to the JSP basically translation of JSP page, compilation

90
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.400
of JSP page.

91
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.680
So translation of JSP, which basically is separating the HTML tags and GSP tags compilation of JSP

92
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.790
for that compilation of Java file class loading for the loader class instant donation.

93
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.360
If you created a object or something inside that JSP then initialization of JS that's methods again.

94
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:41.410
Then the request processing when it's done all the things class loading, we have to process that request

95
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.390
and destroys for the end.

96
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.580
You can see JSP that ended here.

97
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.710
If you create log in page JSP logic is indeed similar like that for that purpose.

98
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:59.480
So our lifecycle is translation compilation plus loading initial instant ionization initialization request

99
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.700
processing destroy as simple as that.

100
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.130
So no need to require all these things.

101
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:10.220
Like you should not remember this, but this is very important part you should remember because if you

102
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:16.670
have some errors while compiling then no need to check for your syntax or anything for that.

103
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:22.400
Like if you have some errors, like logical errors, like class loading errors, no need to check for

104
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.000
translation.

105
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.920
And that part you can directly check for requests, processing or not.

106
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.540
If request is processing.

107
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:35.240
If request is not processing at that part, the class is loading and everything is loading, but request

108
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.200
is not processing.

109
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.110
So there is some error with our database or something like that.

110
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.890
You can check.

111
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.880
So I will show you the general manager.

112
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.050
Pictorial manager.

113
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.130
So JSP.

114
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.270
JSP translator.

115
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.530
Then servlet file.

116
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.850
They need to be compiled.

117
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.620
It will create a one class file.

118
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:59.170
It will load to the Java runtime environment, then servlet objects, then buffer.

119
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.340
That is dynamic content.

120
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.050
Actually, buffer is for loading that page step by step.

121
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:13.960
If you have loaded all the pages inside the server as we are loading only then on the local so our machine

122
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.090
will take all the or our computer will take all the load of that thing.

123
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.370
But what this buffer will do, it will create some stack of pages and it will load time to time.

124
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:30.520
So Servlet JSP takes more time than servlet for loading purpose.

125
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.360
So.

126
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:39.670
But it's time we can see the code complexity while writing the JSP is very easy, so most of the times

127
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.370
we prefer JSP over the Java servlet.

128
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.900
So in the first part, I will tell you about the GBK collection inside JSP and everything.

129
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.820
So let us move to our this thing.

130
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.000
So as I told you, we have already created an admin log in part.

131
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.370
Let us check for the validation part.

132
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.700
So no need to worry how we can create inside the source package.

133
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.410
Just click right, click new and create java package or as your name.

134
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.060
I choose us on line examination system inside that office.

135
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:18.300
I'm going to create three sub packages which is controller for the controlling part or use model for

136
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.460
deploying all the model types.

137
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:26.840
Like if you have some DB database parts and everything, like if you are this is validating just part

138
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:32.700
but storing part and everything I'm going to use or is DB for database management and that connection

139
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.570
part everything.

140
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.750
So I separated these two different parts.

141
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.300
So let us see how we can create validate student So this is our package.

142
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.880
I'm importing this, you can just import this.

143
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.590
Also import java dot io dot star also.

144
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.820
So no need to write this again and again.

145
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.210
So it will take part of that always.

146
00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.790
So.

147
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:08.390
Let me lead this part also because of all writing, these are some default things you can check here.

148
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.410
Okay.

149
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.960
So this is all about these things.

150
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:23.280
So we SDB and I'm going to create some part here for the database to run for the student database admin

151
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.120
for that information.

152
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.430
Student Diego For that information I'm going to be inside the model, so we will create in the next

153
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.940
part.

154
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.970
So this is all about these things.

155
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:42.100
Always remember, you can also use this also because I print everything again and again here for the

156
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.660
Java servlet.

157
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:51.010
What you can do is you can just put start here and you can take this, but for simpler purpose.

158
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:57.070
I'm putting this all the files I will print here in 14.

159
00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.690
All.

160
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.180
Celebrities.

161
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:08.120
If you you have some errors with Java expert, you can go with the libraries and you have to load the

162
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.410
Java expert here.

163
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.880
So as you can see, I already loaded inside this JDK.

164
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:22.190
Or despite java expert if not loaded, just click here right and jar folder.

165
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.080
Download the Java X from that purpose and open it.

166
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.610
So.

167
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.100
This is Java is loaded so no need to worry.

168
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:39.130
It will show the error or not it will will remove and it will take care of that Java expert also.
