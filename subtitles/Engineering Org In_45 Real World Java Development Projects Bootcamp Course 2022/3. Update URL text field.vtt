1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.200
Here onwards we called each component and right the set to grow.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:17.250
And so a little you are in text field and not the known value we have to give its the value priority

3
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.970
always.

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:33.010
So priority we always and here I will also tell you this thing it is treacherous.

5
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:42.130
What we have recall you are in text field to the end.

6
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.510
So.

7
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.270
No, no child.

8
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.630
What?

9
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.840
I'm.

10
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.340
Want to know.

11
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.670
Something.

12
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.380
Okay.

13
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.840
Firstly, we have to write.

14
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.830
So what's the next thing?

15
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.220
We will stretch your text field to the end.

16
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.130
So we will call the actual component and here we'll set H2.

17
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:31.640
And then what we need is the you are in text field and here we will set the priority to the always on

18
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.650
here done.

19
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:46.110
And afterwards we will call the control box and get it to children this one.

20
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.680
And afterwards we will call add back button not to reload.

21
00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:04.190
Notice the Mac button and then what we will do again, we will call the controls edge hooks sorry s

22
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.020
box and then the children of course.

23
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:18.630
And then we will do not add settings space the new space

24
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.270
to the new space read.

25
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.820
What we need is not showing the test to show that the new space reason

26
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.750
and.

27
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.070
We cleaned this thing off and.

28
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.710
We will do this same thing again on this one.

29
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:58.040
So we will copy this control policy and pasted pasted in here.

30
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.920
We will set it to the forward button, this one.

31
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.460
And here it will set it to the reload button.

32
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.830
The new space season, everything will seem and again we need the new text field.

33
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.790
So this one call the URL text field.

34
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.320
But here we have to set the border first.

35
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:45.850
So we need to set border layout that border and we write the new border and write the new fee.

36
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.270
Firstly, if the border stroke.

37
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.540
Who knew bowlers stroke this.

38
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.570
First one is the right one.

39
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.190
Another is the.

40
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.500
So we drive the news through.

41
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.760
And afterwards, we will give it the value.

42
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.970
New borders, truth, justice.

43
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.490
Okay.

44
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.350
So we have to give it the value.

45
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:24.640
So first value, what we will give, don't fight one white color, one another.

46
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:37.400
We even give it the value borders, truth, murder, truth style this one and set it to the non.

47
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.120
This one not.

48
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.340
And another thing which really need is the corner radiator.

49
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.580
So we're gonna corner radiator and set it to that empty.

50
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.320
Of course.

51
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.950
And another one.

52
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.750
What do we need?

53
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.770
The last thing which we need is the new border.

54
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:09.870
So we will call the new moderates and keep it to three or two.

55
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.540
I will give it the three.

56
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.660
And now we don't need anything.

57
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.130
So we will delete this thing and set this thing.

58
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.150
So syntax error semicolon.

59
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.490
And that includes two things.

60
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.650
Firstly, we will import this.

61
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.560
Okay.

62
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.860
No, we have to set the vertical box as well.

63
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:47.500
So we box not get children and don't add.

64
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.310
I know.

65
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.270
Control controller spokes.

66
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.600
And then we will create a.

67
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:00.600
Sorry.

68
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.310
The box.

69
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.310
This one don't get children.

70
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.110
This one on what we would do next to start at Peter.

71
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.480
So we need the progress bar.

72
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.610
And then afterwards, what we need is the border panel.

73
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.690
So border being the pin.

74
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:41.720
That being equal to new border ban and send it to the few.

75
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.050
This one we have to import this also so import border and and afterwards you need the box again and

76
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.110
get children.

77
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.070
And then add those up.

78
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.090
Okay.

79
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.120
So here everything is done.

80
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:14.460
Now what we need, we need over this class to create class, space, reason.

81
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.270
Okay.

82
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.620
Finish.

83
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.530
Oh, no, we need that thing.

84
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.350
So we will delete this.

85
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.420
Okay.

86
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.640
We need this class under this.

87
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.760
So what we will do?

88
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.910
Here.

89
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.060
We even tried.

90
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.940
I read class.

91
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.570
Peace region.

92
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.630
It will inherit.

93
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.670
It will interface.

94
00:07:50.700 --> 00:08:00.230
It needs the interface of the region gone with region and then parenthesis.

95
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.820
I think it should be the case and import this also.

96
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:17.550
And afterwards what we need the public space region constructor, we will call it constructor speech

97
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.970
reason, the parentheses part.

98
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:27.000
And then again what we need to super our current class constructor.

99
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.680
So from here onwards we will call over the parent class constructor and set minimum.

100
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.130
But we need the property and it to.

101
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.510
Five.

102
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.310
I'm here.

103
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.570
This thing is done.

104
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.430
And what we have to do, we have to write the party of these matters.

105
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:59.080
So here I will write first reload method body the first engine not execute script.

106
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.390
And what we need when we reload it will be go with the history.

107
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:11.460
So this tree and the cool.

108
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.540
And the zero part, and this will return afterwards.

109
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.180
You will write the matter of the go forward.

110
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:29.790
So we'll write our engine or execute script and we need that back one.

111
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:37.080
So write history nerd back and call this one.

112
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:44.220
And now another thing which we will need to go back method also.

113
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:52.560
So here we will write the first engine or execute script on here.

114
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.430
Okay, just a minute.

115
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.710
We have to write this.

116
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.330
The this was the forward.

117
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:09.420
So what we will write the forward and copy the same thing and write here, but we need to change it

118
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.620
to the back.

119
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.540
So here we'll write back and after word.

120
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.640
All these methods have the body.

121
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.620
Now we have to complete its body also.

122
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.400
You call this load, you are in this thing.

123
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.220
Load you the text field or get text.

124
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.840
So firstly, what we will do, we have to check the condition.

125
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:51.170
So here what we give is to set it to the other part and now we will call the string to be equal to you.

126
00:10:52.380 --> 00:11:02.450
You are then give the argument and set it to know you are in your model semicolon.

127
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.420
And with this we have to check the conditions as well.

128
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:20.610
So if temporary effect is null, then just return the GDP, write this thing and set it to the GDP.

129
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:27.960
Call to you all, set it to stuff again.

130
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:38.130
We will write HTP in this, this and upload our URL which we have right this thing.

131
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.650
It will give the default one another thing.

132
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:51.450
It will show that because we have not created the method and here the if condition is to check.

133
00:11:51.450 --> 00:12:00.480
So another thing, what we do, you are in text field and it's set its text to the temporary one.

134
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.090
So here you are temporary one.

135
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.050
Then we will load the engine part.

136
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:15.650
So here load and give it to value DMP and here everything is done.

137
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.350
Now we have to get the body of the two URL method.

138
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.310
So here we will catch the exception.

139
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:32.100
So try return new item which we have created in the part.

140
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:45.510
So here the string i will give a str and then I will write to external, not so to external form.

141
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.440
I am done.

142
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.870
And then we have to catch this exception also.

143
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.780
So.

144
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.330
This one.

145
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.380
Now what will be the.

146
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:09.450
Okay, so the exception will be the malformed.

147
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.930
You are an exception here.

148
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.400
Exception.

149
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.510
Exception.

150
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:23.790
Then it's 40 and here it will be returned null.

151
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.640
So we have to import this.

152
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.070
Also, it's imported.

153
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.900
Everything is done.

154
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.830
Two so strong.

155
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.910
Okay.

156
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.990
Now, another thing which you have not done is stop public.

157
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.970
We have to need to get box also.

158
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:59.030
So we box and we'll write the guide box here and create this method by name.

159
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.090
Get the box and return over the box.

160
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:05.570
Okay.

161
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.390
This one.

162
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.070
So here we have created this matter and.

163
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.020
You think we need this?

164
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.250
Okay, so we need this on here.

165
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.040
And all these things are.
