1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,750
Here.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,690
I have the class for the baggage object.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,700
This object is movable.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,110
So it also has a move method which we have created previously in the player class here.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,170
So it also contain that matter.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,140
So firstly, it should extend the actor class here.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,060
Because I mean based glacier.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,210
Here.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,630
I have the constructor.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:34,530
Okay.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,750
So under that, we will create.

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,880
My provider.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,620
Initial baggage, name, baggage.

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,640
I don't know.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,450
We have to write the body of this method, so that is what we have to do.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,720
We will firstly set our image icon.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,740
Icon is equal to.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,450
Okay.

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,420
So we need the new image icon.

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:23,450
And said depart to Assad see the comma baggage that B and she.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:38,520
Now after that we have to write I am she is equal to I could not get image right the image also and.

22
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,030
Okay.

23
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,940
Now we have to take matter of movement also.

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:56,850
So here I will write public void means give the parameter of the x comma into y.

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:08,550
Under this I will write into the x equal to same body of the player class which we have created in that.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:18,480
So same thing in divide here y and the class y here.

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,210
Now this set x

28
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:32,130
give the parameter to the x here set y gives it parameter with the DVI.

29
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,270
So here.

30
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,820
This is the class for the baggage object.

31
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,450
This object is movable.

32
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,770
So here we have the move method also.
