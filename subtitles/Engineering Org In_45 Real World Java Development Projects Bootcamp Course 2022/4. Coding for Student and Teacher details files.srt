1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,520
So here is our ad student class, which is defined inside the package university.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,620
We have imported the necessary package.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:15,060
Abstract Window Toolkit Package, Abstract Window Toolkit, DOT Event Utility, Random and Swing Package.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,850
After that, we have defined our class, which is implementing action listener.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,050
We have defined the instance of frame.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,290
These are the labels and text fields, buttons and combo box instances which we'll be using inside random.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:40,110
We have defined the random values to generate the student roll number by using math or math class and

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,010
inside the.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:51,440
Public and student that is a non parameterized constructor created the frame background color layout.

10
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,230
Then we have defined the label inside which we have defined the image.

11
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,950
Add that image to the label said bound for it and its layout.

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:06,710
Another label it bound for it found its its font for one color, adding it to our label adding it to

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,460
the frame.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,350
Another label has name bound for it, font for it, adding it to the label.

15
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,220
And that text field even respect to that name and adding it to the label.

16
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:29,030
Under the label as Father's name bound for it font and adding it to the label similarly for the respective

17
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,630
text field.

18
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:38,030
Then there is a label age setting bound font and adding it to the label respective text field then.

19
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,180
There is date of birth bound font, adding it to the label respect to text field for the date, date

20
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,200
of birth setting bound ending to the label.

21
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,740
Then there is an address bound for it, font for it.

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,840
I think the label is better text field for the address, bound for it, adding to the table respective

23
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,010
label as phone setting, bound for it, setting font for it and adding to the label.

24
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,780
Then respective text field for the phone number setting bound for it, adding to the label respective.

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,210
Then we have a label email ID.

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,610
And setting bond for it font and adding it to the label.

27
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,110
Then we have a respective text field for the email bound for it, adding it to the label.

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,260
Then we have a new label as class 10th setting bound for it, font off it and adding it to the label

29
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,640
after that.

30
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,600
We have respect to test field for the class ten math.

31
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,850
Then we have the bulk of Class 12 marks.

32
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,250
Respective test field for the class 12th marks are the high number labels we would estimate for that

33
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,150
number label.

34
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:43,150
Then roll number label, which will estore respect to text field for the roll number.

35
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,900
And this will add the roll number, which is starting from 1533 and add the remaining first, which

36
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,030
we have calculated prior.

37
00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:00,150
Then we have label course combo box for the course label branch combo box for the branch, then the

38
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,050
button submit and button cancel adding the extension to both of the buttons.

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,750
After that, we had set the visibility of the frame through its size and location.

40
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,610
After that, we had action performed fetched all the required details of the student from our combo

41
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,870
box and text fields.

42
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,460
After that, if the source of the button is from we setting the connection, creating the query to insert

43
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,700
into the student table, executing queries, selecting, showing the dialog box that is inserted successfully,

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,950
catching any exception.

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,950
If any exception occurs, then if the one button is pressed that is for cancel, then we will set the

46
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,060
visibility of the current window as false inside main function, creating the instance and setting the

47
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,860
visibility of the frame as true.

48
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,040
Let's move to our next next class that is told in details class.

49
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,510
So inside a student detail class, it is defined inside the package.

50
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,360
University imported the necessary package that is a WTA event, swing and SQL.

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,750
Then inside then we are behind the class is student details extending frame and implementing action

52
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,030
now and three labels.

53
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,830
One table and three buttons, text field and a string.

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,250
Which will hold for the columns of the student details.

55
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:21,560
Any string of this area of a string, two dimensional area of string, 20 plus 13 inches close to zero.

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,970
Then we have certain details.

57
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,370
Had a restaurant setting size for its.

58
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,640
Location and layout.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,740
Then there is a label.

60
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,070
In the role.

61
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,210
Number two, delete a student bound for it font and adding it to the frame.

62
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,180
Respective text field for the roll number.

63
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,920
Button delete background foreground bound for it.

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,970
Then there is the label new statement.

65
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,140
There is label a student.

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,890
There is a button at the student.

67
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,110
And there is a label update.

68
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,150
There is a button for update.

69
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,650
A student adding.

70
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,280
Excel listener to all the three buttons.

71
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,200
Now inside try block.

72
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,570
Initializing the connection, creating the query is storing it into a string is is one.

73
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:17,940
Executing the vary by using execute query method of using the statement instance and storing it in the

74
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,720
results set.

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:27,630
It will iterate over the records of the student table in the database and storing the records into the

76
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:38,520
two dimensional array by incrementing the columns at every line and at last incrementing the row and

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,650
initializing the column again to zero.

78
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:50,080
Then creating the table by passing the two dimensional array and the column area of a string catching

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,400
any exception if occurs.

80
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,730
Initializing a scroll panel.

81
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,780
Setting bond for it and adding that solar panel to the frame.

82
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,360
Background color is white and adding action to the B1.

83
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,120
Now action performed we first inside the connection.

84
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,970
If souls from B1 V fetch the required text field and create the query.

85
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,440
Delete student from student where roll number is equals to this execute.

86
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,460
To update that query, we will execute update method to update record in the student, delete the record,

87
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,750
set the availability of the current window false and the student details window as.

88
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,610
True.

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,170
Then there is a cash exception which will handle any exception because if the source is from B to we

90
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,210
will open the screen class from the B three, we will open the update in class.

91
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,530
Then inside the main function we have created the instance of the current class.

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,770
Now let's move to the teacher details which will look more similar, like the student details as well.

93
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,510
Define inside the package university we have imported the necessary packages a w t a w t event swing

94
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,410
and a scale.

95
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,720
After that we have defined the class teacher details extending frame and implementing Excel three label

96
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:19,140
one table three buttons text field a string exclusively used as column to create table and a two dimensional

97
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,870
array of a string 20 into 13 angles for row and column respectively.

98
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:31,200
That is integrated variable initialize to zero zero then inside teacher details heading into teacher

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,110
details setting size for the frame location of the window.

100
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
Layout as well, creating a label enter roll number to delete feature.

101
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,620
It's not roll number.

102
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,820
It should be employ ID.

103
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,550
So that will be the interim idea of the teacher, then setting bound for it.

104
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,300
Font adding new text field for the to write the employer ID.

105
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,990
Button delete add new teacher label button.

106
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,180
Add update teacher details.

107
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,760
But an update adding a listener to the three buttons inside the dialog in the connection selecting the

108
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,480
vary from the teacher executing that query is storing the required details inside our 2D array of strings.

109
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,100
Creating the table by passing the to the area and the column area.

110
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,870
Adding a scroll panel to the table.

111
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,620
Setting the background color as white.

112
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,230
Hiring action is not off the table.

113
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,150
Inside the action performed.

114
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,680
Initializing the connection.

115
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,740
If the saw is from B1, then we will fetch the required details in the string and a string.

116
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:42,960
Q.

117
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:50,330
We will execute the query delete from teacher where it is goes to the fetch details from the text field.

118
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,850
Execute obtain that query so the visibility of the current as false and the teacher details as true

119
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,330
catch operation will handle the errors if any occurs.

120
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,690
Sources from B2 we will call the teacher class.

121
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,250
Sources from B3.

122
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,110
We will call the update teacher class.

123
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,480
Inside the main method we have created the current class instance and setting the visibility of the

124
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,010
frames through.

125
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,520
Now we have discussed about all these classes.

126
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,200
Let's have a look on the run of these classes.

127
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,530
So let me run from the login class.

128
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,800
First.

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,590
This will be the result of law in class.

130
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,730
I'll be validating the details.

131
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,520
Click on login.

132
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,540
This is the result of project class inside master new faculty.

133
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,240
This is the result of ADD Teacher Class.

134
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,940
After that.

135
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,620
And you would imagine this is the result of adding a student class.

136
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,960
Now inside the detailed menu element, we have student details.

137
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,850
This is the result of student detail class.

138
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,780
So as there is no any detail not we have added any student.

139
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,370
So this is showing the back end table, which is upside down, is scrollable as well.

140
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,410
So we will be adding details in our library, which will be the last video of this project.

141
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,970
And similarly, we can check the details, teacher details as well.

142
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,520
So this will be the result of teacher details.

143
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,740
So.

144
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:35,060
We have seen the implementation and line by line explanation of this code of these three classes.
