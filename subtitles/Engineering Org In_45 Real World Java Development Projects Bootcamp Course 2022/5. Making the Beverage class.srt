1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:11,420
So till now we have covered all the items in the form as the select side, the number of classes, the

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,340
selections of menu items in the form of a radio button.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:26,180
Now our next concern should be adding buttons or add an order in order to make add those items to our

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,190
cart or to check from the cart and confirm our orders.

5
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:38,110
So we will be adding a button and calling this as buttons.

6
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,060
And this is going to be a new button.

7
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,690
And inside this button, the string that is going to be displayed on the button is add.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,240
So call it add item.

9
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:58,550
Add item is going to be the size like the string displayed on the button.

10
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,840
Now in the similar way, we have to set size and location.

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,520
So I am going to copy this from here and paste it here and now.

12
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,950
Just change this glass.

13
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,920
So add.

14
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:29,920
So adding this button, setting it size and location and then to set like our dedicated size and location

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,310
for this button is very important.

16
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:41,590
So changing the size to 100 and suppose to 30 from the left.

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,170
Okay.

18
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,580
So we have added this is a button.

19
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,220
So labels should be replaced with button and this also be done.

20
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,380
So we have added this add button to our frame.

21
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,500
This is the button which we are currently adding.

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,930
Now our next concern is adding order button to the frame.

23
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,070
So in that same way, we will be adding the order button also.

24
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:23,320
So pasting this and just changing the name and size is going to be same, but the difference is going

25
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,110
to be in the like distance from the left border.

26
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,700
So suppose all the above one was 100 from the left, so it should be supposed to be from the left.

27
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,090
And so this is going to be.

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,540
So we have seen one thing in the beginning.

29
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,500
We have to firstly replace this add to order in order to make them.

30
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,750
Dedicated for.

31
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,160
Okay, so just pressing enter once we have declared it.

32
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,200
So you do not have to.

33
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,510
Type it again and again.

34
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,520
So we have created this that button.

35
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:15,110
So one thing I was talking about that by default in the initial window, it was set to the like disabled.

36
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,620
So this order button was disabled in the beginning.

37
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:27,290
We talk gray background, so we have to set this order button to disable by default.

38
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:38,900
So this is going to be built in order and we have to set it to like disable so set.

39
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,270
Enable and be a boolean input which it takes.

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,300
This set enabled function takes boolean input.

41
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:58,090
So setting this boolean to force and this will be responsible for disabling the order button by default

42
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,900
in the beginning.

43
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:06,400
So we will be adding functions in order to make this button enabled in future and we will be adding

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:16,360
code responsible to that also now so that we have added the select size, the radio button selection

45
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:25,600
option, these input text field which will be asking for the number of classes and at the last page

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,420
we have added add button and order button to our frames.

47
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:39,160
Now one more thing which is being displayed in the form is the number of items which we have added along

48
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,330
with the add ons.

49
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:48,970
So the code responsible for that is this basically we are calling this as a label report which is giving

50
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,780
us the report of the items which we have ordered.

51
00:04:52,780 --> 00:05:03,490
So basically it is the like log of what is being ordered throughout in that step, that specific step.

52
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:13,120
So after each order this label will appear like unique label will appear after each unique ordering.

53
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:22,060
I suppose we have ordered water so that will appear also again, if we order tea then a different report

54
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,830
will appear that we have ordered suppose 3 million glasses of tea.

55
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,440
So this report is responsible for that part of the form and after which we have set the size and location

56
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,670
for that also.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,500
So by far we have completed all the things associated with this label class.

58
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,880
Now we have to add actions inside this.

59
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:57,490
So in order to add actions, action listener to every button, radio button, combo boxes and everything,

60
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,510
we have to write code inside this action, perform, function.

61
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:10,630
So in order to attach actions, firstly we have to create classes for the rest of the requisites for

62
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,490
this application.

63
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:20,950
So in the prototype part, we have discussed that as a whole we will be requiring six classes in this

64
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,060
project.

65
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:31,900
So the second class, which is concerned with this label class like these two are attached.

66
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:41,710
So creating a new class, calling it beverage dot java and our class beverage is being created.

67
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:51,400
So this beverage class is going to be responsible for the size, the prices of the items in the menu

68
00:06:51,400 --> 00:07:01,630
and the amount of the items like how many items we have ordered and what is the total cost of the whole

69
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,810
items summed up as a whole.

70
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:11,750
And everything attached like size, price and amount is going to respond.

71
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,790
This class is being responsible for those things.

72
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:27,220
So initializing some global variables which are going to be required for this class creation, the size

73
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:37,390
and similarly price and amount so private and the size is going to be an integer.

74
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,500
So sorry, the amount is going to be the integer.

75
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:51,460
So in the amount and then private or double price or price could be our decimal also.

76
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,260
So we are declaring this as double data type.

77
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,380
So size, amount and price.

78
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:10,510
We have declared now after this creation of a beverage class, we have to create a constructor which

79
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,320
is going to contain the beverage object.

80
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:27,880
So beverage and the arguments inside this is going to be the size and one more the amount.

81
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,640
So size and the amount.

82
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,540
They are going to be the.

83
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,650
In arguments for this constructor.

84
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,690
Okay.

85
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,660
So we have passed the argument successfully.

86
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,650
Now inside this beverage object.

87
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,890
So part is going to be the title.

88
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,210
So initially there is no title for the beverage frame.

89
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,230
So we are leaving this as empty after this.

90
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,730
This dot size is going to set the size.

91
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:16,110
So this keyword is responsible for accessing the objects from like private objects from a class.

92
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,780
So we are using this keyword for amount and size.

93
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:34,210
So we have been successfully accessed the size and the amount after which initially the price total

94
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,690
is zero as initially we have nothing ordered in the card.

95
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:46,720
So setting it as 0.0, this 0.0 is due to the double data type declaration we have made.

96
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,330
So the price is initially zero.

97
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:59,230
Now after this, we have to create a functions for get size, set size like we have to use, get and

98
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:06,390
set methods for the setting, the size and amount also the price.

99
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,410
We have three things so we have to set and get all three of them.

100
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,960
These three are declared as a private data access specified in the class globally.

101
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:28,900
So in order to access those private objects, we have to use that get and set keywords in Java which

102
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,850
will be responsible for accessing all of them.

103
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:43,300
So suppose I am using public string as the size is a string, so get size.

104
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,690
Get size.

105
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,550
I am going to call.

106
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,290
And bracket.

107
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,660
So this get method is called which is going to return the size.

108
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,550
So we have successfully created this great method for size.

109
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:11,140
Now, in a similar way, we in order to update the size, we are using the set method.

110
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:23,110
So set size is going to be responsible for updating the size of the items which we are ordering through

111
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,500
the application.

112
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,750
So this is like using size as the argument.

113
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,680
And inside this we have to like access the size.

114
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:40,960
So this dot size should be accessed in order to make any updates to the size.

115
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,710
And after like setting the size, we will get this size with the help of get size method.

116
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,100
So we are done with the size part.

117
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,500
Now, in the similar way, we will do this for price and amount.

118
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:07,000
So let me copy this part and paste it two more times to set it for price and amount.

119
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,610
Okay.

120
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:14,440
So firstly, changing this get size to get.

121
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,530
Price.

122
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,720
Yes.

123
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,930
So and the price is double.

124
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,660
So changing it to double hair.

125
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,050
Okay.

126
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:36,460
So this will return the price and this get metal will return the price.

127
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,280
Also setting the price.

128
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,540
And this is also double.

129
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,770
So double.

130
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay.

131
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,180
So we are done with this.

132
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,930
Now after this.

133
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,510
Doing this for.

134
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:55,960
Okay.

135
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,780
So we have to change this also price.

136
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,360
And this dot price.

137
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,620
And the prize part is also done now for the amount.

138
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,880
So the amount is this data type integer.

139
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:20,450
So we have to call it as int and then return the amount.

140
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,900
The amount is returned using this get method of java.

141
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,350
Similarly set amount.

142
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,760
Like to update the amount we have to.

143
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,800
Change it to end.

144
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,980
And this event is going to be responsible for updating the amount.

145
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,480
Also we have to change this size head also and set it to price.

146
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,240
So we are done.

147
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,410
They're just changing the amount also.

148
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,230
And similarly here.

149
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,600
Okay.

150
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:13,310
So we have successfully get and set all three of the object which were declared inside this beverage

151
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,850
class.
