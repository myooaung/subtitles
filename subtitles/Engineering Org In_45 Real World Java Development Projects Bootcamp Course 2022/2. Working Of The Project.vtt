00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.440
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:07.840
So I hope that you all have read through the introduction of the application part pretty well and have

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.710
given again the rough idea about what this application was actually about.

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.290
Now, in this part, we will like looking up to the detailing of this application in detail that how

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.210
actually everything is working.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.920
What about these buttons?

7
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.410
What is this help page and how we can like set tasks inside the stack now after hitting the start button,

8
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.810
how we can start setting up the task.

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.750
So coming to the homepage first, this is the homepage window.

10
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.310
So whenever we run the application, this homepage is opening and what this homepage is actually containing.

11
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.080
So this is a frame which we are building with the help of Java swing.

12
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.680
Also, there is a panel inside the frame.

13
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.250
This panel is containing some of the text or images and two buttons.

14
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.640
So this is a separate panel for these two buttons.

15
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.360
You can see that there is a hybrid effect added to these buttons.

16
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.720
So whenever I hover through these buttons, there is a highlight upcoming on the buttons.

17
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.300
Also there are talking about this text.

18
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.140
So this is the like heading of this application.

19
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.030
We're calling it as task planner.

20
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.450
This is making task management easy.

21
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.090
So task management means made easy.

22
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.090
Also, this is the main goal of this application that it is helping us to increase our productivity

23
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:45.910
by focusing one task at a time, like focusing at a specific task in a specific duration of time and

24
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.330
not combining a task and messing up things by setting multiple goals in a fixed time.

25
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.270
So yes, this is the main goal of this application.

26
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.600
So here you can see two buttons, that is a help page.

27
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.830
So on hitting this help page button, this window is opening.

28
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.280
This is like this is containing view of the question.

29
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.990
Basically, this is about this page of this task line and application.

30
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.330
Here we have questions like harder task line and improves my productivity.

31
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.010
So it is answer that it constantly sends you notifications, keeps you on tracks, and it provides an

32
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.220
easily understandable interface, which is fair enough.

33
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.810
This is definitely understandable interface here.

34
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.350
We have already encountered this interface and I hope that you found it understandable at all.

35
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.290
Also, how do I use task cleaner?

36
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.440
So we have already talked about it that how this application is working.

37
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.050
Firstly, we have to come to the start page on hitting the start now button.

38
00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.990
Then we can decide our tasks, set a specific time to it and then then a message will show that how

39
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.680
much time you wasted or saved, which we already like talked about.

40
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.930
Who is this application made for?

41
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.080
Like for whom this application is mainly made.

42
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.480
So the main focus while making this application was students.

43
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.280
So basically students are facing a complete mess nowadays.

44
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.820
Like students have to study online, all the things have to make on their own.

45
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.990
There is no offline schooling and everything, so we have to focus on the things that how students can

46
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.490
manage their tasks of staying at home and without wasting the time, they can increase their productivity

47
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.260
an optimal amount of time.

48
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.940
So basically this application was made for the school and college students, which can make them focus

49
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.760
on their work rather than any kind of distraction, which is very common nowadays.

50
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.840
And yes, this application can also be used by anybody else.

51
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.170
Also, not only the college students and school students can use it, but anybody can use this application

52
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.500
as everybody has to save that task.

53
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.290
Management is important for everybody, not only for the students, but all of the people of all age

54
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.890
lines.

55
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.640
But yes, now let us come to the start.

56
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.560
So I'm hitting that start now button.

57
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.330
This window is opening.

58
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.080
So suppose we take a random example.

59
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.270
Suppose we want to complete a task one, just taking an instance.

60
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.880
So as we have talked about it, that anybody can use the application.

61
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.180
So suppose that House Maker wants to use this application to select setter.

62
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.110
Time for that.

63
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.710
So suppose they have to buy vegetables.

64
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.540
We have to set the name for the task inside this task, one name, text field and coming to our time.

65
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.360
So suppose we have to buy the vegetables by 5 p.m..

66
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.510
Okay, so we have a selection box also 2:06 p.m..

67
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.590
So we have to like complete the buying vegetable task between 5 p.m. to 6 p.m..

68
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:25.930
This is the timeframe we have decided for buying the vegetables and on hitting this continuous button

69
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.170
we will land up inside the timeline interface.

70
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.310
So perfect.

71
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.170
We have a buy vegetable task created that is a color.

72
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:44.130
This just that when we have to complete this task and as I have told about it, that there is a timer

73
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.860
running here which is showing that what is that time left for us to start buying vegetables?

74
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.690
So suppose we have set it for 5 p.m. and currently we are three hour 10 minutes ahead of this 5 p.m..

75
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.920
Then this timer will show all the time accordingly.

76
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:10.080
So this timer function is like helping us to like helping us to know that what is the time like left

77
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.570
for doing that specific task?

78
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.430
So yes, this is the number line which is containing 12 to 12 time.

79
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:25.950
We can say that that is 12 to the night time and this is that time, 12 noon to 12 night.

80
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:32.880
So we start set to buy vegetables in the evening, 5 p.m. to 6 p.m..

81
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.090
So we are 3 hours ahead.

82
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.140
So suppose we want to buy the vegetables right now.

83
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:48.270
Like we went to the market for some task and we want that we should buy the vegetables right now so

84
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.010
we can also click this done with buy vegetables.

85
00:06:52.020 --> 00:07:00.050
And this will enable us to the next page which will see that how much time we have wasted or saved.

86
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.850
So we wanted to buy vegetables between 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. hardly.

87
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.140
We could not delay buying vegetables after 6 p.m. and we have to start making that dinner or anything.

88
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.140
It could be so we can buy these vegetables before 6 p.m. any time.

89
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.890
The time will be saved as a result.

90
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.600
But if any time we are sitting after 6 p.m., then our time is going to be wasted.

91
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.330
I will show you also that part of this application.

92
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:36.210
Firstly, let us hit on this done with by vegetables button to see what happens.

93
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:41.970
So currently we are 3 hours, nine or 8 minutes ahead of the task.

94
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.960
So yes, after hitting on this done button, you have saved 3 hours and 8 minutes messages showing up

95
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.120
on your screens.

96
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.310
So what was it about?

97
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.380
Like we have set a task.

98
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.010
We have completed that task before that deadline.

99
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.880
And ultimately, what is the consequence?

100
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.680
We have saved a lot of time.

101
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.850
So basically this helps us to remind things.

102
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.230
We can also call it as a total.

103
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.320
So we can create a to do list in the application that what are the things we have to do?

104
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:22.590
Or we can attach time to it or it is upon us that we have to do in our specific time.

105
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.570
That is a deadline or not, but there is also a multiple values for this also.

106
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.700
So, yes, this was the first test.

107
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.450
Now let's try to create second task.

108
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.910
So, yes, here we can add two tasks at a time also.

109
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.880
So suppose again as to want to complete.

110
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.390
Homework.

111
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:53.460
Now, after creating these two tasks in the timeline, let us hit this continue button and see what

112
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.120
happens.

113
00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:03.390
So yes, this dark green color timeline duration is for having that dinner, which is 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.

114
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.100
and this light green interfaces for completing the homework.

115
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.470
So we have to complete two tasks by 11 p.m. in the night.

116
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.570
We have to have the dinner between this one hour and to complete the homework.

117
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:26.850
So suppose that we have like 8 hours, we are 8 hours ahead of this 9 p.m. when we are 7 hours ahead

118
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.620
of this what we say having the dinner.

119
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.730
So suppose we have already completed our homework.

120
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:42.720
We want to make the homework right now, not delayed to the night and we want to hit on this done with

121
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.530
complete homework.

122
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.880
Time to check that.

123
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.620
How much time we have saved.

124
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.880
Okay, so this window is showing us that, how much time we have saved.

125
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:58.950
So on completing the homework or 8 hours and 3 minutes ahead, we have saved this much amount of time

126
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.400
and this is how we manage our task.

127
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.090
So yes, this was all about this application.

128
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:12.000
We will explore more while also in the programming section and then running the application that how

129
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:18.540
like what are the other features inside this application and okay, so let us go back to the home page

130
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.080
first.

131
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.380
So yes, we will start making this application.

132
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:28.860
So what are the things which should be kept in the mind in the coding program like programming of this

133
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.150
application section?

134
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:38.460
So let us like draw a rough prototype first, learn how we should move forward in order to make this

135
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.480
application.

136
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.370
So opening the text editor and aligning the tasks.

137
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.200
So suppose the first step is to create a new project.

138
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.930
Create a new project in the ID.

139
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.460
And.

140
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.280
So yes, we are making this project from scratch.

141
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:06.310
So we will start creating a new project from scratch now making the main class.

142
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.250
So the main class is going to be that timeline.

143
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:17.210
Class, which will be responsible for testing and running of this application.

144
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:23.560
As the only the main class we come in order to run the application.

145
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:31.420
And that application will be like called inside this or the classes will be called inside this main

146
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:37.990
class to add that functionalities inside the main class, but only the main class will run.

147
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.420
Now what are the other classes?

148
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.400
So yes, we are having a homepage, so we will be making a home class.

149
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.350
So yes, this was the home page.

150
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:53.980
So we have to make a dedicated class for this home page now the next class.

151
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.830
So suppose we are also having a helper.

152
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:04.360
So the next class we will be making is going to be the help class for the help page or the about page,

153
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.590
whatever we call it.

154
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.640
Now, what is the next class we are concerned about?

155
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:16.060
So we are done with the home page, the help page now or there was an end page which was showing that

156
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.270
how much time we saved or wasted.

157
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.950
So end the class.

158
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.100
For the like deciding that how to calculate.

159
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:32.480
Basically we will be adding a for loop for calculating that time which that button is clicked and the

160
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.470
time which was actually set for that task.

161
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:43.760
So that end page will be calculating and then displaying the amount of time saved or wasted for that

162
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.930
specific task.

163
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.580
Now we are done with the end page, the home page, the help page.

164
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.590
Now let's see what is left.

165
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.530
So, yes, we are having a home page.

166
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.280
We are having a help page and page.

167
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.100
And now what is left?

168
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.140
This is the schedule page.

169
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:08.240
Here we are scheduling our task and the next is the timeline class.

170
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.690
So yes, two classes are left in order to be arranged in the pathway.

171
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:20.900
So the next class we are going to make is supposed this is the schedule class and we are going to schedule

172
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.800
our task.

173
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.380
So set tasks and time for it.

174
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:32.930
So we are going to add a basically form like interface for this task.

175
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.380
So suppose this is the schedule page.

176
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.480
Here we are scheduling our tasks.

177
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.090
So there will be initially there was no text field pending.

178
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.530
Once we set a number, then according to that number, forms will appear.

179
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.000
Task name one.

180
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.320
Task name two will appear.

181
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.880
So suppose I hit five there, then five input field per head.

182
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.400
So yes, this is working according to that.

183
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.210
So we will decide inside the schedule plus that how.

184
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.080
Okay.

185
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.100
So this is scheduled class and yes, we will decide that.

186
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.590
Okay.

187
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:15.070
So the next class is the time class, which is definitely the main class in the timeline class only

188
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.520
we are setting.

189
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.430
So yes, let us have a look.

190
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.020
So this is the timeline class.

191
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.630
That is a timer, that is a button.

192
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:28.370
And again, a timer behind like beside the button, the done button.

193
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:35.080
And this is the main timeline which is containing our task and also it is containing our task, the

194
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:41.920
colour for that specific task and it is present in that amount of time we have decided it for.

195
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:48.260
Okay, so this is the timeline class and after this, making all the classes, we will try to run the

196
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.480
application and see what happens.

197
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.160
So let us start our coding execution part in the next video.

198
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:01.580
So see you in the next part where we will start creating our project in the ID from scratch.
