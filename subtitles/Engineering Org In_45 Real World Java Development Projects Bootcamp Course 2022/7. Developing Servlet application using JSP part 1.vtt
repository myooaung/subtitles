WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.380
So we already created one command line for this.

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.590
So now we are going to create one solid web application platform using this symmetric key encryption

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.610
and decryption.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:23.250
So considering I'm using encryption part and decryption part in the same interface for my purpose,

5
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.220
for the project purpose to display, it's working.

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.700
But what you can do, you can create two different programs for such things, and you can display it

7
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.600
like that only.

8
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.170
So let me show you how we are going to perform.

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.120
This is my NetBeans IDE Apache and it means IDE.

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.930
You can choose this or you can choose Intel ID for web development also, but preferably for web development.

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.710
If you want to simplify this, you better go with NetBeans instead of using intelligent.

12
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.870
So hit enter to new project would be java web application or I'm giving them as.

13
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.910
Encryption app.

14
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.300
My name for this kid next to your server.

15
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.490
I'm choosing glass v server java eight eve context bot view and hit enter next.

16
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.080
Don't specify anything.

17
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.220
If you want to specify my application with spring web, go with this.

18
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.120
Otherwise never give anything so it will create project for us.

19
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.370
Default project for us.

20
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.280
So wait for some time.

21
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.250
It will work.

22
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.050
So okay, so now we're done with our encryption part.

23
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:57.640
So this is indexed HTML and this in my index HTML and you may find all these things here, source packages,

24
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.640
these things and all the things still manifest here.

25
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.300
So let me delete this because.

26
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.620
Also discord in the web pages.

27
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.490
We never required these things delete indexed also because I'm going with JSP pages, java solid pages.

28
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.060
So now what I require I'm going to create here one filter.

29
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.530
So what is the filter in the default package?

30
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.710
You can create new packages also java package.

31
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.690
So let me mention one java package as and start to encrypt.

32
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.550
Okay.

33
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.810
In this encryptor, i'm going to create a new other thing.

34
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.790
What is other thing I'm going to mention?

35
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.470
I'm going to create filter here.

36
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.150
Next name it says in group filter.

37
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.340
I'm going to mention in group filter.

38
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.540
Then he tenderness add smell.

39
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.930
Oh.

40
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.030
And I need to give the.

41
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.190
Enter at least when you are eating.

42
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.290
So I need to enter this also write request package code.

43
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.660
Everything is mentioned here.

44
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.120
Filter mapping, so I need to change the filter mappings.

45
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.950
So I need to mention this next.

46
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.040
CORNISH So in the encryptor, I created one filter.

47
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.960
A filter is nothing.

48
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.550
But you can say all the things are already mentioned here.

49
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.670
So this package and delete these 20 lines.

50
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.360
Because it always comes with some importance.

51
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.280
So let me.

52
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.390
Also Java.

53
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.550
So let's is showing me the error.

54
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.400
Let me tell you why it's showing me the error.

55
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.540
First, let me add library java, which is Java X.

56
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.510
And if you haven't installed it, my suggestion is already download that Java X Library.

57
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.620
So I already added Java X in my part.

58
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.250
So.

59
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.080
Wait a minute.

60
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.480
I added a little wrong like.

61
00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.030
Our Job Board folder java extended to.

62
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.770
And you do many Java effects.

63
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.510
Effects for Java effects.

64
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.550
You think so?

65
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.330
It will take care of this part.

66
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.220
Java X.

67
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.750
And what I'm going to create here is to remove these parts.

68
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.610
And need to remove some part.

69
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.520
And let me tell you why I'm doing this later.

70
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.680
Let it be here.

71
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.560
But let me.

72
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.820
Me.

73
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.670
Because this is not no longer required.

74
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.320
The right chord part and everything dimension.

75
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.450
It's not always working.

76
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.190
Then we cities.

77
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.620
This is the filter, basically.

78
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.050
Let me do one thing.

79
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.990
There are a lot of things that may remove all the things you're currently and.

80
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.750
Let me add my teams here first.

81
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.850
So I created different things.

82
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.790
So let me implement my own things here.

83
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.220
And it.

84
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.820
Package name.

85
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.790
In.

86
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.170
Three.

87
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.790
And let me implement some methods.

88
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.210
So you.

89
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.340
Then let me.

90
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:02.030
I used your another thing, so let me mention these things also.

91
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.680
So this is just filter thing?

92
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.010
No.

93
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.200
Then log file.

94
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.150
It needs to change.

95
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.470
So change it accordingly.

96
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.350
I will tell you what is this is doing and everything.

97
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.090
So this is just a filter.

98
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.710
With filter info.

99
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.610
With all the message.

100
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.640
And everything.

101
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:36.630
So now we're done with this thing, but we require the one page or we can say JSP.

102
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.550
Let me mention JSP as index.

103
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.510
You can finish.

104
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.790
Because the next JSP is very important here.

105
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.760
Check whether your file is added in web XML.

106
00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.540
So.

107
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:11.030
There is no way dot xml or creator, so we need to create this way.

108
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.480
Broad xml also.

109
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.220
In later part, we will update our decryptor and everything.

110
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.860
If you hit the properties.

111
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.330
You got the idea about all the properties.

112
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.200
So let me add index page also here.

113
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.600
So this is so late.

114
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.880
I'm adding with my.

115
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:57.940
And.

116
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.130
But.

117
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.550
Encryption.

118
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:17.910
Encryption.

119
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.640
So we created this.

120
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.270
Now, let me tell you what we are missing.

121
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.390
We created one filter thing, but.

122
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.580
If you check.

123
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.450
Let me check whether.

124
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.970
There is an option.

125
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.390
Okay.

126
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.760
So I made one mistake.

127
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:45.970
Here.

128
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.980
Basically.

129
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.770
It's a very huge mistake, actually.

130
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.740
I haven't added him.

131
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:05.650
We brought X-Men, so let me create one filter which encrypt.

132
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.450
Good.

133
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.740
Next.

134
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.300
I had information.

135
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.720
Click next.

136
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.750
Okay, finish.

137
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.630
So now it will edit that part in my me.

138
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.310
Copy my card again.

139
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.450
The thing is, I need to refactor this file.

140
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.440
Also rename.

141
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.240
What I haven't done, which is encrypt filtering.

142
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:08.920
Because I read in the web broadcast and that's a very huge mistake read that if it.

143
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.270
So.

144
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.620
Wait.

145
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.700
Showing me the error.

146
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.550
Okay.

147
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.530
So it will take time to detect this.

148
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.110
It's not showing me here, but showing here.

149
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:37.700
So in the XML you may check the filters added if you want to check our filter is working or not pressed

150
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.250
clean and we'll go to windows and output tools.

151
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.390
You can check here, but let me tell you what is.

152
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.310
The encryption filter is working here.

153
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:56.130
So it is just like a back end part with filtration part like I'm adding what I'm going to do.

154
00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:07.620
I'm going to create one database in Java for creating log file in Java file only to store all these

155
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.790
encryption keys.

156
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:10.640
Okay.

157
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.280
So as you can see, build is successful if I enter new.

158
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.700
OC on Java DBS location not set.

159
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.140
I don't want.

160
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.330
Basically in that location also.

161
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.250
Starting my glass server.

162
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.060
So it will take time for some time, but it will work.

163
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:44.660
So in the next part, what I'm going to do is show you I already created this.

164
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:50.880
In the next part, what I'm going to create, I'm going to create one filter or front in part for this

165
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.890
purpose, to create one response, response and everything.

166
00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:03.420
And I'm again going to use filter thing and remember why I'm using filter instead of creating directly

167
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.320
servlet.

168
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.370
So let's can easily.

169
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:14.970
Anyone can check that part but the filter thing no one can change easily.

170
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.950
So it's currently running and starting.

171
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.550
For me all this over.

172
00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.060
It's working.

173
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.410
Move back address only.

174
00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.840
So for the first time deployment, it will take time.

175
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:49.510
After that, it will really give you the starting server program.

176
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.170
So.

177
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.290
Left me running.

178
00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.870
And while it's running, let me tell you what is this thing?

179
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.780
So instead of using directly these things.

180
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.320
So let what I can do.

181
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.590
I can create one filter.

182
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:09.700
And filter.

183
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.460
It's just like filter the information.

184
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.330
So there is one mesh in filters.

185
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:22.990
As you can see, there are different log methods also to store in one file with Java WebLogic, similar

186
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.770
as you can see.

187
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.140
So that's mapping thing I created.

188
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.480
But that simple thing I'm going to do.

189
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:41.050
So currently different frameworks are deploying and it's been their own work and it's in place of deployment.

190
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.530
So remember, you have to always add, I made a mistake.

191
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.120
I won't take that part in that way.

192
00:15:51.110 --> 00:16:00.790
So what I performed is, as you can see, not very wrong, but you need to create another web project

193
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:01.970
on your own.

194
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:02.450
So.

195
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:04.650
That's very.

196
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.320
Not good thing to perform again and again.

197
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.350
Currently.

198
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.400
It's still working.

199
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.210
Build successful and it's working.

200
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.690
No, wait a minute.

201
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.340
I understood.

202
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:27.060
Okay.

203
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.380
Now you can kick over the encryption as it is working and move into application.

204
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.030
So we move this part.

205
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.900
Now in the further part, what I'm going to create, I'm going to create an XML and editing index and

206
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.310
editing part in later.

207
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.450
Hope you understand.

208
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.050
Thank you.
