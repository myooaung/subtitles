WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.340
Okay.

2
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.540
So we have covered all the panel and beaten things till now.

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.610
A few are left, so we will be covering in this part only.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.910
We will be concluding basically the application by this video.

5
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.490
Okay.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.510
So we have created all the patterns for playing the game.

7
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:31.930
We have a score updation panel or a separate like a dedicated thing for names of the player and thus

8
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.190
force of the player.

9
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.490
And in this, we are going to play the chances.

10
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.170
You can see everything is working perfectly fine and.

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.440
I suppose we want to make a and so we will try.

12
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.220
Okay.

13
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:54.170
So the dialog box appears saying that predicts wins and after clicking okay, the score should be updated.

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.730
So it is updated.

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.150
So the functioning of the game are by far working fine.

16
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.380
We have everything like action listener site attached with every button's event.

17
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.170
These are basically buttons, nothing else.

18
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.810
We can see that we are clicking at a button, so we have two more things left to do.

19
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.320
We have to set like reset the game again.

20
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.000
Only after that the score should be updated for the player.

21
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.820
So currently that is okay.

22
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.810
So the score is updating again and again for X.

23
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.640
This should not be the way for it.

24
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.590
We have to first reset the game and then again start playing and then only the score.

25
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.140
Score should be updated.

26
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.200
So by far we have covered most of the part like suppose it is like 90% of the programming section is

27
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.390
covered by FA.

28
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.470
Now the two more things that are left to be placed in the function are like notes and clauses.

29
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:11.540
Plus, of course are the reset button and exit button, which will be responsible for escaping through

30
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.770
this application.

31
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.870
So we are going to cover this in this part only.

32
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:28.450
So yes, so this is the 14th panel in the row of all the 15 grid five and three grid layout thing.

33
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.240
And this panel is for the reset button.

34
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.050
Let me show you.

35
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.790
Yes, this is the reset button and it is located at the 14th panel in the consecutive rows of all the

36
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.170
15 panels.

37
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.560
So this is the like line border and border layout styling for the reset panel.

38
00:02:48.740 --> 00:03:00.500
And like continuing to this, I am going to add a G button and that button is going to be named as button

39
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.880
reset and it is going to be a new button.

40
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:16.100
So calling it as yes, it comes in the suggestions and the string should be passed as what should be

41
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.360
displayed on the button.

42
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.980
So we want to set the string as reset of all.

43
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.220
We want to set the button as reset.

44
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.350
So reset is set.

45
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.050
Okay, so reset is set.

46
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.200
The text was reset in the 14th panel.

47
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.040
We are successful in naming the button.

48
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.020
Now the next concern should be adding action list not to the reset.

49
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:54.170
So adding action listener and a new action is going to be attached inside the action listener.

50
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.630
So calling it as that only so action listener.

51
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.990
And okay, so it is done like this only.

52
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.250
Actually, it's not.

53
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.160
And or.

54
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.370
Calling actually is not is a function of force.

55
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.580
And inside this action is not.

56
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.210
We are going to initialize a public void action performed function.

57
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:33.580
So public void action, perform action perform is the name of the function.

58
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.370
We are like initializing.

59
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.560
And inside this function the argument is action event.

60
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.440
We are or we have already used this event in our program.

61
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.220
So the suggestions are showing us that.

62
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.630
Okay.

63
00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:02.340
So the function is created now inside the function we are going to set, like what is actually going

64
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.950
to happen when we click the reset button, all the field blocks, whether it be with zero, like suppose

65
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.160
this is the stage of the program.

66
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:22.650
So when we click reset, the program will set to this stage only no more changes just to the chances

67
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.510
of the players will get vanished and the scores will remain the same.

68
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.960
Only these nine things are going to set to null.

69
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.110
So for every beat then we are going to set text to NULL.

70
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.880
And this is just a simple thing.

71
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.590
Nothing is so complex about this.

72
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:54.740
I am going to copy this like so this was but between one and it was from J Button Company and I am going

73
00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:03.950
to copy it for suppose eight more times three, four, five, six, seven and eight.

74
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.390
Perfect.

75
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.320
So we have copied it for.

76
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.230
Total of how many times?

77
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

78
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.000
It was only seven times.

79
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:27.740
Two more times now replacing her three, four and up to nine.

80
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:37.870
We are setting all the nine blocks to NULL after this so that a new game window should open and the

81
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:46.280
player should get a chance to play again and like, make their scores better, of course.

82
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.650
So, Kay, we are setting everything to NULL after this.

83
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.410
And like the similar thing we have done above.

84
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.540
So I am going to copy it from there.

85
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:10.460
Only this is like we have set to, we are just going to remove the private URLs in order to not to declare

86
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.720
anything again.

87
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.470
Okay.

88
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.760
So I'm going to pass the test and remove all the private.

89
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.470
We do not need any private, so as we have already declared it.

90
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:30.890
So what is the need of calling it as private or public as when it is globally declared above?

91
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.360
So no need to re declare it.

92
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.710
Okay.

93
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.440
So in order to remove it now formatting it.

94
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:47.930
And we are done with setting all the buttons like the actual listener is attached with the reset button.

95
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:58.190
And after attaching events like actions to the buttons reset button, and this is going to happen when

96
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.810
we click the reset button.

97
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:07.070
Now, I added a bit of styling to the reset button, like the font name is Tahoma.

98
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.610
The font size is going to be 22.

99
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.670
It is bold, of course, and the pointer panel 14 is to be added with this reset.

100
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:27.500
Now let us try to run the program and check that whether the reset button is yes, it is actually here.

101
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.370
Now, let us take a look that whether it actually resets.

102
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:32.690
Okay.

103
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.880
So player x one, congratulations.

104
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.390
X the scores are updated.

105
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:44.420
And now on clicking reset, everything is managed, so it is perfect.

106
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.850
Now that is okay.

107
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.870
So it is automatically updating the scores of this day.

108
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.340
So we will take a look into it.

109
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:03.660
Firstly, we will be adding like we had already set conditions for the 14 panels.

110
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.460
Now only the 15th panel is left.

111
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.240
Of course.

112
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.430
Then what the 15th panel is, yes, it is the exit button.

113
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.460
So the window should be escape as far as we click at the exit button.

114
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.310
So now creating the exit button.

115
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:31.730
And in order to create the exit button, we firstly have to create a panel, panel slash underscore

116
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:42.340
15 and this is going to give us a new panel which will be so like containing the exit button.

117
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.040
Yes.

118
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.950
So New Japan panel is the component of the string library.

119
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.430
So.

120
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.740
Yes, okay.

121
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.850
So this should be capital.

122
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.020
Okay.

123
00:09:54.050 --> 00:10:02.570
Solar panel 15 is created and now we are going to add text buttons and events inside this panel.

124
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.040
Okay.

125
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:13.880
So here the 15th panel is completed with a button or action event attached to the button.

126
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:22.280
And the string inside the button is going to be exit and this button is asked for.

127
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:31.970
I can see that it is the similar to the button reset, but only the actions involved inside this panel

128
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.080
is different.

129
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.880
And what are the actions involved?

130
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.410
So let's take a look.

131
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:46.730
So when we click this exit button on the panel, the frame will exit.

132
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:54.740
And if a statement is like written inside it j option pane.

133
00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:03.770
So confirm dialogue frame and yes, I can show you confirm you want to exit.

134
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:10.040
So this confirmation dialog box will appear asking for that.

135
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.200
Do you actually want to exit the game?

136
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.880
There are two buttons attached with it a yes button and a no button.

137
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:25.700
And that is what actually like placed inside this action event thing, we are going to ask the user

138
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.900
for a confirmation and there will be two buttons attached.

139
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.400
Yes, no option.

140
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:40.100
We are using g option pin component of the string library and we are going to ask the user for a yes

141
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.210
and no option.

142
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.950
And we have not to write a separate code for this yes and no thing.

143
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:56.120
We have already the things in our library we have to not to like make two buttons separately, style

144
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:03.920
them and do so just call option pinpoints no option and you will be here with this thing.

145
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:04.880
Okay.

146
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:15.410
So after completing this, the system will exit with like null or this zero is for null false and leaving

147
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:22.790
x application like we will be escaping to the window with this action.

148
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.710
So this action is.

149
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.230
Thin hair and the confirmation if we are pressing yes, on the confirmation, we know.

150
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.390
So we will exit the window.

151
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:42.350
And if we press no, then we will remain in that window only that is no separate line of code written

152
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:47.000
for that we are only setting conditions for clicking yes button.

153
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:52.670
So after this we are going to add styling also to the exit button.

154
00:12:53.690 --> 00:13:00.380
So I am going to copy this thing as there is no specific change inside the button.

155
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:00.790
Okay.

156
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.780
So we are going to press this call.

157
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.960
Okay.

158
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:12.590
So we have pasted the styling thing for the 15th panel also and replacing 14 hair with 15 will make

159
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.760
it like dedicated styling for the 15th panel.

160
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.370
Now let us try and run the program.

161
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.300
So running Java four noughts and crosses class.

162
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.700
Okay, so we have reset button.

163
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.640
Okay, so that is some error.

164
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.240
We have to change the thing between reset.

165
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.340
No, this is between exit.

166
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:44.450
So we don't exit should be replaced at both the places we have placed reset button to the 15th panel

167
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.590
by mistake.

168
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.960
Okay, so now try and run it again and see that it is working fine or not.

169
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.470
So it is perfect.

170
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.570
It is working perfectly fine.

171
00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.020
Till now, everything is correctly oriented.

172
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.100
Inside the frame we have a panel of 15 buttons.

173
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:12.890
Overall, we have nine train to three grid layout for the playing of the game, like x0x0.

174
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:20.150
And if a specific player wins the dialog box up there pressing, okay, the score will be updated on

175
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:27.230
clicking the set, the game will reset and on clicking the exit button, a confirmation dialog box appears

176
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:36.050
and if we click yes on this, then we will escape through this window we call System Dot Exit to Zero

177
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.280
and we click yes.

178
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.830
And we exited the application successfully.

179
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.580
So by far we have covered everything inside the application.

180
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:48.710
This is a completely functioning website like application, we call it.

181
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:58.730
And this the application will be able to teach you the concept of Java and we have used extensively

182
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.210
the string and the JWT toolkits of Java.

183
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:11.570
So yes, this application will make you able in understanding the open concept, the swing and JWT things

184
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:18.680
like we have used everything label option, pin button, text field and frame layout everything grid

185
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.040
layout.

186
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:28.400
We have used most of the components inside the Swing and AWG toolkit, so everything is going to be

187
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.910
made clear in your mind after making this application.

188
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:39.650
So I will insist you all to make this application on your own from scratch in your compilers by installing

189
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.840
the latest JDK versions.

190
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:50.720
And after this, I am sure that you all are going to have a good grasp at Java, its libraries, the

191
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.020
Swing and AWP toolkits and everything around this.

192
00:15:54.020 --> 00:16:03.140
So ending this project on a good note and thanking you all for joining this project learning session

193
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.150
and try this on your own.

194
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.050
Thank you.

195
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.340
Have a good day.
