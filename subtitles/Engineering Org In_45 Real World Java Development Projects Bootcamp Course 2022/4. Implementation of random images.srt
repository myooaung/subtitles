1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,000
We have built this in what we have to do.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,440
We have to add images to the list here.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,880
So here we will write list.

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,270
Don't add.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,390
Here we reinforce.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,230
Barometer to put the stops.

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:41,130
And similar to this new start at a barometer.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,140
The cracks here.

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,630
No.

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,380
What we have to do on this constructor and.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,770
We will write one more thing.

12
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,110
We will create a function.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,470
Random images.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,630
Soon here we will ride public void right to the referendum.

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,680
In Jesus name.

16
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,570
Dismantle and dismantle what we first should do.

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,530
We have to take a for loop.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,400
So we will write end equal to zero semicolon.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:47,280
IE is less than two labels toward length and increment of i.e. under this fourth loop.

20
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,370
We have to take.

21
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,830
We have.

22
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,370
To bring.

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,990
All.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,010
No imagery here.

25
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,280
Right.

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,610
Let's start.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,930
Get.

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,720
We need.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,330
I do not.

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:19,420
Next end, we will give the barometer to start.

31
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,730
New start.

32
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:36,770
What we need size here this one and it's done semicolon and then we will simply go to random image of

33
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,420
this to done.

34
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,890
So here, this thing.

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,550
What do you do?

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,510
No.

37
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,040
We have the images.

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
All right.

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:18,650
So we have to change it to the images on any and give the italics and those zero and initialize it to

40
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,010
the random image.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,970
And let's see if random image dot equals

42
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,420
footsteps.

43
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,780
So we have to do okay.

44
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,630
We have to do images on the food only.

45
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:01,090
On the zero and no food, i.e. equal to cracks.

46
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,590
And this is done and we need the ice part here.

47
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,410
Through here.

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,610
We've been trained in the interests.

49
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:26,970
Even just order with the index and the zero put it to the bootstraps cracks footstep on.

50
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,560
He showed me how to manage.

51
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,400
And now we have to print.

52
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,970
Okay.

53
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,590
We need after this one assault.

54
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,380
And here we will try it.

55
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,300
We need we have to copy this.

56
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,940
We?

57
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,580
Let's do this again.

58
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,060
Assault and right.

59
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,350
This one and simply piece to this and another assault.

60
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,170
Who simply goes blank.

61
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,950
Blank.

62
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,010
So here we will try this.

63
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,300
This will reduce the output here.

64
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,340
Can.

65
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,170
So it's done.

66
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:51,540
Now what we have to do is go to the constructor and now we have to populate table table with images.

67
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,550
In random order to hear what we will do.

68
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,010
We will go to random images method and.

69
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,970
Here.

70
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:11,970
Okay.

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,020
So notice firstly what we have done at random in interest.

72
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,340
So here we have get the images and we have done.

73
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,670
Go get old friends.

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,620
Different images.

75
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,040
No.

76
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,400
Simply, we will run our program and check.

77
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,050
Is it working or not?

78
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,490
You have to do one more thing.

79
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,950
You to this and no.

80
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,990
What we have to do here.

81
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,300
We have to go to random images matter.

82
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,300
Simply run our program here.

83
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,230
Okay.

84
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,040
So we got an error here.

85
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,110
In.

86
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,050
But I know many Jews who came.

87
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,820
Put it to no one here.
