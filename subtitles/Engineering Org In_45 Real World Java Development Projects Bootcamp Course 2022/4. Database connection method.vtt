00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.270
In previous tutorial, I told you we need to create one database and we need to create some Java methods

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.670
to input that data in the database.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.580
So on screen you can see this is our database.

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.040
So I'm using user another user, which is my password, and you can change this again.

5
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.420
It's on your domain.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.520
Let me lose this.

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.540
So these are the reason we are going to create three tables here, which is basically first is e-book.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.490
Second is librarian for librarian method.

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.320
I'm putting the constraint here always e book peak, which is name primary call number is enable what

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.390
is basically call number for that purpose, which is basically it should be a primary key.

11
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.560
I am enabling that call number should be unique.

12
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.790
So name can be common.

13
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.160
Publishers can be common quantity can be common.

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.230
Issued off number is also it can be common, but call number should be unique.

15
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.920
Similarly ID of E library should be unique.

16
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.250
I'm mentioning that email can be same because it's university thing.

17
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.420
You can part of that and you should book which is call number which should be not null student and not

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.190
null student name also.

19
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.220
I'm mentioning that and return starters.

20
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.590
I mentioned all the things.

21
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.130
So these are all about how you can create that table and database.

22
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.340
So let us see how we are going to creating this.

23
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.730
So I already told you you need to create view library librarian form and why it's going showing me error

24
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.730
because in the login form I haven't mentioned all the things here, so it's showing me error also.

25
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.490
I like librarian form also is missing there.

26
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.080
So I created a librarian form also.

27
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.670
Librarian form.

28
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.550
As you can see here in this part and in the images, there are images and all the things are mentioned

29
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.910
now.

30
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.200
So let us look inside The View Librarian.

31
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.780
We need to create Librarian D, but before that, inside the deal we need to mention some DB part.

32
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.500
Also y db part.

33
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.640
I'm going to tell you.

34
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.910
Because we need to mention the database.

35
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.920
So I'm creating DB, which is basically database DB, dot Java and clicking the finish.

36
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.470
So I'm creating your when.

37
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.300
What you can say.

38
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.580
Simple thing I'm creating I'm just creating package.

39
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.660
And let me mention the package is over the simple.

40
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.930
As simple as that.

41
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.280
I created it here.

42
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.550
So this is my servlet, and this is all the things I mentioned.

43
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.050
So let me also.

44
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.040
String.

45
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.820
User is equal to.

46
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.210
As I told you.

47
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.450
And my another user is string.

48
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.990
Password is equal to.

49
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.720
One, two, three.

50
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.440
So this is my username and password.

51
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.460
If you don't have, you can put your default password and name.

52
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.430
But in my case, I'm using another user.

53
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.240
And one, two, three.

54
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.910
As I mentioned in the notepad, also, I'm creating this I already created this part and I created a

55
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.520
grid connection method here and I'm connecting this.

56
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.230
So I will put your database.

57
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.600
Connection method.

58
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.690
So now we are done with this.

59
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.730
In inside the DB, we created this.

60
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.170
Now in the show we need to create a library in video which is basically librarian thing.

61
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.860
Or we can say librarian part adding and creating.

62
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.770
So let me create one so that with the same name library.

63
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:04.110
And so I'm adding the information and I'm deleting this part, but I'm not deleting the package because

64
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.150
I need to mention it again and again.

65
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.560
I don't want to do that.

66
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.170
Plus, you can lose this part.

67
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.600
Well, it's no longer required.

68
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.790
So let us create library in the world.

69
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.230
So.

70
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.220
As you can see, you can delete this part first.

71
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.880
And.

72
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.080
So now we're done with this.

73
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:44.570
But in the Liberian being, we need to mention the that part also like importing the this part.

74
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.330
So let me put this first.

75
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.120
And we haven't mentioned this librarian being first, so we need to mention that part also.

76
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.100
So now I'm done with this.

77
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.510
So let me explain this.

78
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.350
What is this?

79
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.250
So it contains all mentions here.

80
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.520
I'm importing libraries for first and I'm adding some class, so it will first save in the library and

81
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.940
being with the taking the name from this and insert into the E library and as you know the name, email,

82
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.620
password, mobile, everything.

83
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.920
Then for the update it's update 11 and name and all the things mobile where ID so.

84
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.160
Nothing.

85
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.830
But I'm mentioning your status and everything.

86
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.430
Then this is again list for putting in a list to create.

87
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:44.200
All the things you buy ID, you can check, you buy ID also you can delete, then you can authenticate,

88
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.740
authenticate for the authentication purpose I'm creating here.

89
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.740
And it is basically select email and password.

90
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.260
So for the email we need to mention this, but before that inside we need to create Library Librarian

91
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.510
Bin also.

92
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.360
So let me go with this and inside bin I'm going to create new servlet.

93
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.060
Librarian been.

94
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.400
And then with this.

95
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.610
So.

96
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.040
Let me delete this part because it's no longer required, as I told you.

97
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.060
And let me.

98
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.280
I already created this part library.

99
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.320
And so let me use that part.

100
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.290
So let me tell you this what it is basically.

101
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.630
So it is taking this.

102
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.820
It is putting in another part library and being similarly in the library and being this basically constructor,

103
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.850
all those things.

104
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.160
And it is creating one mobile name.

105
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.470
Also get ID, state ID get name, set name if you know what is doing this.

106
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.830
It is just fetching the data and it's putting inside this.

107
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:07.870
So as you can see, being a librarian and everything is done, but what is remaining is basically view.

108
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.350
So while this view is showing the error, as you can see.

109
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.010
Inside this view is this.

110
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.220
And now you can see this area is also removed.

111
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.770
So you need to save everything.

112
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.010
And we are done with all dimensions here.

113
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:36.830
Basically, we will have vision and everything, but before we need to deploy some another servlet also.

114
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.350
So let me explain what is Lavorando is doing here is basically for the saving purpose and this.

115
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:49.970
But what is inside this bin is basically just taking that data and it's putting in another variable.

116
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.620
So why this is required.

117
00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:00.060
If you are going through this, you will understand it takes too much time to process some parts as

118
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.250
this is I am doing in the solid part.

119
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.250
It takes as for the library and method only I created that much part.

120
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.300
So it is it should be like some different things here also.

121
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:19.200
So if you are managing your schoolbag, consider you are managing your school bag or college bag.

122
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.730
You put in order weights, tabular manner.

123
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.670
You took your timetable.

124
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.630
You choose your timetable or you took your timetable.

125
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.300
Use it first.

126
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:27.720
Be ready.

127
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.410
Then you are putting the first notebook or your book or anything.

128
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.460
Similarly, what I I'm doing here, I'm creating three packages here.

129
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:41.790
So let's is for the controlling part, the is basically for logging and all the methods is considering,

130
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:47.430
but it also contains one DB which is basically the connection and bin being is basically what is the

131
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.690
bin creating bin is for creating all the constructors.

132
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.340
These are the constructors basically.

133
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.860
And from the super method I'm mentioning, this is the super method and if you know the super keyword

134
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.950
and this keyword, so I'm mentioning this idea to, to decide and because it's private, so it gives

135
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.160
me some security purpose inside the database.

136
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.880
Otherwise anyone can check that part and anyone can use that part.

137
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.390
So and all these methods get set it.

138
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:22.560
What is this get it is for client but it is for so server purpose gate name again for the client purpose

139
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.440
set name is for the server purpose gate email.

140
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.580
All the things are similar.

141
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.600
So why I'm creating two different methods here again and again.

142
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.570
Similarly, I'm going to create for admin part also.

143
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.000
Creating these methods also is very helpful.

144
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.830
Again, this is public.

145
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:47.190
If it's a public, but all the variables are private, so no one can change this public and all the

146
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.940
things here.

147
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:55.560
So it gives me 100% abstraction you can see here, and I'm putting in the again and again using this

148
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.920
keyword and return keyword.

149
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.670
So this is very simple thing I can do.

150
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.790
If you I don't know if you don't want to create such methods, if you don't want to create but ideal

151
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.140
condition, you can create this.

152
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.210
And it's very easy if you don't want to create your dimension inside the View library itself.

153
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:17.670
And this is very tremendous because you librarian, you can create only the view librarian thing only.

154
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.880
So as you can see, this is being ID and everything you can create.

155
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:21.990
So.

156
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:30.700
Usually simple and librarian's been been what is basically this is so it will create one method as I

157
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.410
told you beans and everything.

158
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:38.090
So as you can see, the Liberian bean and bean, everything it will create.

159
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.230
So this is very simple thing I can do with this.

160
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.630
If I change to the bins, as you can see, this will be the error.

161
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.110
So for librarians, Bean is very helpful for me.

162
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.830
And if you know this part, it is advanced for loop or for each loop you can say.

163
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.520
As for Liberian bean, as if you know this Liberian bean.

164
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.800
And so it's all the things here.

165
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.240
But like LeBron video, as you can see, this is a realist.

166
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:14.350
If you want to evoke or use that area inside Java, you have to go with two methods for normal for loop

167
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:22.030
or normal loop, but you can use for each loop in any library, at least any advanced or secondary data

168
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:30.480
like array strings, list, ArrayList, set all things hashing, hash it even you for each loop.

169
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:38.230
So for each librarian despite being is that what we can instant variable for this list this list what

170
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.400
it will be do it will get ID and print everything inside a tabular manner.

171
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:50.780
And I'm mentioning your tabular thing here and I need to mention your admin librarian form also added

172
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.930
library librarian form.

173
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.570
So we need to mention what is a librarian form here also and it should be in servlet.

174
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.610
So I need to mention again here.

175
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.680
So let's not.

176
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.390
Because it's Soviet only.

177
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.710
And delete librarian is again so part.

178
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.100
Let me one do thing we'll copy this because naming is very important.

179
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.430
Otherwise it will give some error again and again.

180
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.120
So if you want to delete, it will delete this part.

181
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.910
So always we have to mention this.

182
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.330
As you can see, I mentioned all the things here.

183
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.560
And now we are done with this, if you want to add here.

184
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.350
You can add this part.

185
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:51.370
So now we're done with Ed librarian or let me tell you one more in been part which is basically.

186
00:12:52.330 --> 00:13:00.340
So I'm going to create it later but I'm going to use this part because it is very helpful to me first

187
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:00.610
thing.

188
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.140
It's very helpful for me.

189
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.430
Second thing.

190
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.830
I'm mentioning all the beans here, so.

191
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:14.190
Currently it is no longer required for us because we haven't created such methods for that purpose.

192
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:14.940
But.

193
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.180
In in advance is very helpful while deploying all the parts.

194
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.300
So let me copy post.

195
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.610
I already created this code.

196
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.780
I'm just explaining you inside this.

197
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.300
So this book bin.

198
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:42.350
Similarly, I'm going to create one issue book bin or you can say or issue book bin part for the issuing

199
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.830
that.

200
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.500
With some date method in school.

201
00:13:50.160 --> 00:14:00.210
So I'm just mentioning this because I don't want to focus in later part because it's just been part

202
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.040
or you can say method part.

203
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.360
So now we are done with this.

204
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.990
So our been part is done.

205
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:19.600
As I told you, we created three bins here, librarian issue and book.

206
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.110
So now we are done with that connection part also.

207
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:31.390
So in the next videos, I'm going to create some HTML and I'm going to add some audio part.

208
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:37.260
Also inside that purpose and servlet, we are now focusing on the solid part only later.

209
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.610
So in the next tutorials, I'm going to tell you how we can create the solid part and everything.

210
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:48.130
So in this tutorial I just created Book Bin and we are going to use it later that purpose.

211
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:53.950
But I already created this so there is nothing but all the student ID and restrictions always create

212
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:59.830
some tables earlier before deploying all the projects because we are going to use this also inside the

213
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:00.340
libraries.

214
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:07.450
You need to add Oracle GBC Library, otherwise it will show me the error again as I told you.

215
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:16.840
So let me add that Oracle Library also here, which is basically Oracle database, GBC driver.

216
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.420
So as you can see, this is added inside this.

217
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:27.320
So now our GBK also connected and everything is also connected.

218
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.250
DB is also connected and everything is done.

219
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:37.520
So in the next digits I'm going to create some subnets inside the admin part and the but we are done

220
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.940
with being part and we need to create some HTML also.

221
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.750
So let us see how we can create that HTML in the next part.
