1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,590
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,800
So till now, we have created three classes for all three of the ships which are going to be required

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,900
inside our application the rectangle, the circle and the line.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,550
Now, the next part, in this part, we are going to look up to the main class of this application,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:27,780
which is going to be responsible for testing and running of this application and the name of this class's

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,650
drawing and Java.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,580
So inside our main class, we have made few of the imports.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,660
So these libraries are going to be the like main playing, the main role inside our project.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:51,390
All the components inside this main class are going to be the consistence of these libraries only.

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,560
Okay, so first we have AWP, then this a DOT event which is going to handle all the buttons.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,650
So action listener and action event.

12
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:09,470
So we will be creating events in the form of buttons and attach a function to that specific event,

13
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,180
like attach a function to that specific event and calling it an action listener.

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:24,090
So yes, our separate action is attached to every event or buttons, whatever we call it now, are using

15
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,320
this buffered image from the library inside the Java WP framework.

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,960
So this buffer image is going to save the image in the form of JPG format.

17
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,820
Also, we are using file for opening the file chooser.

18
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,360
Option of our system as a is going to be saved in the form of a file.

19
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:56,780
Also, the random function of Java library as the user can choose any random shape from this control

20
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,450
panel and draw a shape at any random place in this drawing area.

21
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:13,520
Also we have a change of intention listener as okay, so if you chooses one of the shapes, then in

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,620
the next step they can change the event.

23
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,580
So for that we are using change, event and change listener Now inside this drawing editor class, we

24
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,300
have extended this to J Frame As.

25
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:34,460
All of this window is inside the frame, which is due to the help of this j frame component.

26
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,570
So this gave a content pane where yes, all the contents are to be freed.

27
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,360
So inside the frame we are calling the random variable.

28
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,040
Yes, we have.

29
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,290
Calling this from this package.

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,180
So this is going to create a new random object now.

31
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:56,960
Okay.

32
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,640
So the random entry is created now what all of this is doing.

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,090
So this part is for how the buttons are going to perform on.

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,670
So how our rectangle should look.

35
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,670
Ah, the program doesn't know it's on on its own.

36
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:21,680
We have to give our image to how a rectangle is going to look, how a circle is going to look, how

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,010
a line is going to look.

38
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,410
So we have saved everything in the form of images.

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:35,180
We have a circle image, a trash delete image, a garbage patch for the delete icon.

40
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:43,220
This is the line which will be drawn, so the line, length and width are going to be adjusted according

41
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,300
to the specific use the rectangle.

42
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,820
And of course, the save button.

43
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,120
Similarly, this is the take that Benji for undoing the changes.

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,240
We have came across this state when we were in the working part of the application.

45
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,230
So.

46
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,060
Okay, so inside this.

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,330
We have imported all of the images required.

48
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:19,000
So in total we have seven images which we have imported using this image icon component of the buffer

49
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,220
image library.

50
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:28,330
So yes, we are calling all the image and the images will be buffered according to the size set by the

51
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,750
user.

52
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,150
Now the next step is to for the setting, the colour.

53
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:43,030
So I have told you that the by default color is going to be black and the system color is this is going

54
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,880
to be the which is for the opacity of the color and the shade.

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,840
So this is going to be the shade for the color by default for the black color, of course, as the default

56
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,800
color is black.

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,510
Now, this is for the lines, color and line size.

58
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:08,230
Similarly, we are going to use the colors for rectangles and circles also.

59
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:16,360
So our line is a bit different from the circle and the rectangle, as the line is not containing the

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,160
feature empty and full.

61
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:25,630
The line is simply going to be a straight line without the full range of buttons here.

62
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,610
When we click on the line button, this empty and full button will disappear.

63
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,180
So we have set the line, cut a color in line.

64
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,210
Similarly, we have a radio button for empty, full rectangle and circle.

65
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,850
So there are different radio buttons for the oval and the rectangle.

66
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,680
So we are declared radio buttons separately for all four of them.

67
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,560
Now width and height are also going to be different for the oval and the rectangle.

68
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,340
So this is going to be the width and this is going to be the height.

69
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,770
So we have four integer variables for the return, the height.

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,020
Now the drawing area is going to be the center of the frame.

71
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,770
So how this drawing area is located.

72
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,340
So this is the frame.

73
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,960
These are the two panels.

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,470
And in the center of the frame, we are having our.

75
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,400
Our drawing area.

76
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:37,020
So this drawing area is containing a like it is inside a panel and how the panel is located so we can.

77
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,400
So make spaces between them.

78
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,470
Okay.

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:48,470
So this static Z panel is going to be the panel inside which the drawing area is located.

80
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,210
Now we are having a line, a rectangle and.

81
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,710
A circle inside the control panel.

82
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,190
And this control panel is also a panel itself.

83
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:08,150
So, yes, on the left panel, we are going to contain a rectangle, a circle and a line.

84
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,370
Three of them and also two.

85
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,780
And Don't Rush button.

86
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,250
So, Dan, don't rush witness.

87
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,390
Over her remove and current.

88
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:29,220
So this was all about the drawing area now coming to the drawing editor function.

89
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,030
So inside this drawing it did a better function.

90
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,550
We have set the size of the frame.

91
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,560
So initially the frame size is 1000 by 800.

92
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,060
So when we will run the program, the window will open in this dimension and then that is a layout.

93
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:56,070
So we have setup border layout for the frame and also there is a default close operation here.

94
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,850
We have already discussed that on clicking on this close button, we will escape outside the programming

95
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,420
window.

96
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,970
Also, we have a set location relative to NULL, so the window will be opened in the middle of the screen,

97
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,240
not in the left side or the light element.

98
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,430
It is going to be open in the center of the frame whenever we will run it.

99
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:31,320
And also we have a set that title and setting visibility to true is necessary in order to make the frame

100
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,040
visible.

101
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,870
Whenever we run the program.

102
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,810
By default, the visibility is set to false.

103
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:42,210
So in order to make it visible, we have to set the frame visible to true every time.

104
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,900
Now the title of the frame here, you can see that.

105
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,850
Drawing editor.

106
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,760
So.

107
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:57,260
We have used this set title given in order to set the title of the main theme now inside the.

108
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,460
Yes.

109
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,480
Inside the control panel, like inside the center panel, there are three components.

110
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,420
Here we have a top control panel and a left control panel.

111
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,420
So, yes, and this is the main center.

112
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,670
So what actually this is covering.

113
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,830
So the panels are going to contain buttons for rectangle, oval and line.

114
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:31,700
So basically, all all all of them are buttons, whether it be the same at the three of the shapes and

115
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,840
the trash.

116
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,160
Now to add the buttons to the frame, we are creating this add buttons to the left.

117
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,710
Called function.

118
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,940
This function is containing.

119
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,720
This function is containing objects inside it.

120
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,820
For the rectangle circle line.

121
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,590
Like undo the button and remove all of them.

122
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,050
So basically we have to delete buttons.

123
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,090
This is for undo and this is for Clairol.

124
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,420
So and also a save button.

125
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:09,440
So we have created all of them using the J button component of the swing library as all of them are

126
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,470
going to be stored in the form of a button now.

127
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,470
Okay.

128
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,110
So the look of the button are set it to a painted set.

129
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:28,580
Focus to painted is like here we have an orange color of panel, but the buttons have a painted background,

130
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,900
a white paint.

131
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,940
So using this focus, painted is used in order to do so.

132
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,880
Also we have to set the visibility of buttons to true.

133
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:46,930
And yes, in order to do so we are using new buttons.

134
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,600
So.

135
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:57,710
In order to add these buttons to the frame, we are using new button and thus visibility is set to.

136
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,820
For us in the beginning.

137
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,750
So whenever the user clicks the button, then the button colour will highlight, which will show that

138
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,610
yes, this button is selected.

139
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,880
Now once the buttons are added to the frame.

140
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,430
So basically we are using the grid layout component of the frame.

141
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,190
So this is going to be set the layout.

142
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,960
Of the panels inside the frame now or adding all of the buttons to the frame are the save the rectangle,

143
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,690
the circle line and remove and clear all.

144
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:38,550
So this is going to be add the buttons to the left panel and once it is added, then the visibility

145
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:46,260
will be converted to two now creating functions for the rectangle circle and the line.

146
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:55,290
So yes, if the button is clicked, then we have to add the rectangle to the frame and automatically

147
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,340
this button will start showing the figure which is clicked.

148
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,350
So once we click a rectangle then it will start showing the rectangle.

149
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:13,020
So similarly for the oval and for the line, it is going to remove the current element which is showing

150
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,930
at the top and replace that with whichever is selected.

151
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,570
So if the line is selected, then it will remove the current and set it to the line.

152
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,060
Now this rectangle buttons.

153
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:31,320
So what is going to be the buttons when the rectangle is selected?

154
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:38,700
So once the rectangle is selected, we will be having a width and height and a colour picker empty and

155
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,480
full, and here it will be showing the rectangle like this.

156
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:49,590
Now once the oval will be click, then the same options are going to be displayed.

157
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,700
Just the difference will arise that this panel will be showing.

158
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,530
Draw, oval and oval will be drawn when this button will be clicked.

159
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:06,510
So we are writing separate buttons for all three of them, whether it be the rectangle, oval and the

160
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,080
line.

161
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:14,790
But in the case of line it is going to be a bit different as we will be just having a single text field

162
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:24,600
for a side and a set colour and just head text will appear here showing that we have to drag from where

163
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,570
to where we want to draw the line.

164
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:33,270
So yes, we are using the spinner number model for setting the height and width of the rectangle and

165
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,110
the circle.

166
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:44,510
This is responsible for that only the bit, the text which is showing her the width and also this rectangular

167
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,840
text frame asking for the height and width.

168
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,150
Now, after this circle and rectangle buttons.

169
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,870
We are coming towards the line.

170
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,410
So the line is here.

171
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,670
So what is going to be the line buttons so far?

172
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,850
The line here we are having to spinner number models for height and width, but for the line we will

173
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,670
be having a single spinner number model.

174
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,580
As you have seen in the working application, like we were having a single text field asking for the

175
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,730
size of a line which was going to be simply the width of the line as the height of the line was going

176
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,140
to be decided by us, not from where to where we are going to drag that line.

177
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:37,100
So yes, the line button is going to be bit different for for the circle and the rectangle.

178
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,550
Yes.

179
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,140
So it is a bit different from both of them.

180
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,980
Also, this is a cell phone in which the size will be written.

181
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,530
So these are basically the layouts.

182
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,090
Yes.

183
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:58,770
The spinner will be listening to action like it will change whenever the user will click on the arrows.

184
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,370
So it is containing a downward error, an upward arrow.

185
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,950
So this change listener is listening to the actions mentioned by the user.

186
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,750
Also, the set color is going to be same for all three of them.

187
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:19,230
We can choose a colour from the colour picker that what colour we want for our line, circle or rectangle.

188
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:28,070
And a text is appearing in the line part asking for a point like a click on a point from where to where

189
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,250
you want to drag the line.

190
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:38,520
So this was all about the shapes, all three of them, and the buttons are padding in the top panel

191
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,130
accordingly of all three of them.

192
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:47,730
So the above panel was changing with respect to the shapes.

193
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,780
All three of them.

194
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:56,680
So till now we have covered everything about the control panels that how things are going to work.

195
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:05,190
With respect to all three of the shapes and how this control panel will appear in the case of ship accordingly.

196
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:12,930
So in the next part, we are going to add actual listener function in order to attach our actions like

197
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:18,300
events to the buttons that how the functionalities should appear.

198
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:25,580
Once we click this button, then all should be drawn and what should occur when we select this painful

199
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,110
button.

200
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,100
So in the next part, we will be covering that.
