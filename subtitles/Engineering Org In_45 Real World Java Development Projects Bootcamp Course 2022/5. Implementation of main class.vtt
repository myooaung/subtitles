WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.510
So before moving towards the browser class, firstly we have to recall what we have done here.

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:15.930
We have called this method image button and it's used for the image prints and the image part.

3
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.080
And here we have given our humans the image, original image and the double height and the fit.

4
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.310
Now what we have done here, we have created the image view and I have to use for painting images loaded

5
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.540
with this image.

6
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.790
But in class with the image class.

7
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.220
Sorry.

8
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.610
So here we have made that.

9
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.620
And now what we will do here allocates a new image view object.

10
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.860
We have given this image the original image and here we have sets the height and this the first property.

11
00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.170
And afterwards we will do the value sets the value of the property preserve ratio with the roof width.

12
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.430
And now what we will do here, we set this style to the normal one which will see it as we have given

13
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.670
the background colour transparent and the padding to do two.

14
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:22.200
And when the user press the mouse key here, the colour will also be the transparent, but the padding

15
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.210
will be the change, it will be press.

16
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.590
So here I have done the action event listener and yes, all this thing, the value of the property on

17
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.890
mouse press, the style press which we have given here.

18
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.380
And when the mouse will be released here, the style normal, which will give the here and now we have

19
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.850
we have to do this thing create method mean in the Java, in the browser or Java class.

20
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.990
Here we will add the method also what do we will give the body to it?

21
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:07.350
And firstly, the single page is already done and we have made this thing and use the exception also

22
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.620
and catch that exception as well and construct a string representation of this you are in and this string

23
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.240
is created the external formatter of the stream protocol handler for this object.

24
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.000
And here what we will do

25
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.130
here I have done the structure.

26
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.810
So you are part also to the text field in then and updated the progress bar progress while the web page

27
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.680
is loading.

28
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.480
And here another thing which we have done is to render the user in tracks.

29
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.560
The link will change and update the text field with a new field which we will give or the user will

30
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.960
give you all of the kind of operation the current page has.

31
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.540
No, the value will be the empty string.

32
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.550
So here we have done all the things and now what we will do.

33
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:15.170
So firstly we have to go to the browser class and now here I have.

34
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.590
Made this matter.

35
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.240
And now what we will do.

36
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.770
This step starts losing policy.

37
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.450
This thing to specify how the tapping handles tap closing from an end user perspective.

38
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.740
So what we will do?

39
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.160
Firstly, we have to call the anchor pen.

40
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.860
So here we will write.

41
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.570
Anchor Sorry.

42
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.920
Anchor pain.

43
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.720
Anchor being root equal, new anchor being

44
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.120
this one and semicolon.

45
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.530
Now what we will do, we have to create a plus button.

46
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.440
Firstly, we will see how our application is.

47
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.610
Working first, so we will understand.

48
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:32.160
Firstly, we will see this and now we will run our project as Java application and select the mean part.

49
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.080
Okay, proceed.

50
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.660
Well, here you can see the reload, the forward and the backward in here.

51
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.030
So we need this thing.

52
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.190
So what we will do, we have to make the functionality functionality update as well.

53
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.150
We have created that button, but it's not functional.

54
00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.290
So what we will do, we first anchor thing we have created, but we have to give it the action.

55
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.480
Also this button action.

56
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.130
It's nothing doing when I'm clicking it.

57
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:14.160
So what we will do, we will do the button and add button thing.

58
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:24.490
This one on Friday called the new button and gave it off.

59
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:35.770
So this plus value and afterwards we tried to add important thing and add button and give the certain

60
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:44.050
action we need to set on action and give its value with the event listener.

61
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.980
So we will write the event handler part and give the handling part.

62
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.700
So what we will write up start to get that which we need all the taps.

63
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.620
So thought add and we need a new tab.

64
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.770
Then we click that part or the user click that part.

65
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.060
So we'll write new tab on here what we will write.

66
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.530
This thing tabs are placed within tapping each tab present a single page.

67
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.660
So what we will do here?

68
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:37.630
We will write the new tab, comma, the new note we firstly do we need the comma and we will call our

69
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.970
class single page here.

70
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:48.220
And after that we'll call our matter get marks, which will give the vertical locks component here and

71
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.680
the semicolon and after tab start get selection.

72
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.230
We need that selection model and afterwards we'll write the select.

73
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.300
Things like the first or the last.

74
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.520
I think the last, the last.

75
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.540
What will right.

76
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.760
And now what we will do.

77
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.630
We have to set the top left, right, everything.

78
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:26.780
Firstly, when our browser and the open window will come, it has to be in the anchor pane always.

79
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.890
So we have to build the left or the right on another thing.

80
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:37.690
So what we will do, we will try the anchor being not set.

81
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.780
We need first the set top anchor.

82
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.970
It will set the top anchor of the child and contain an anchor pane.

83
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:54.910
If the anchor pane will maintain the child size and position so that its top is always offset by that

84
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.420
amount.

85
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.010
And of course.

86
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.200
Need.

87
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.860
Unmanaged children are ignored for the layout calculation.

88
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:16.040
So what we will do will drain the set top set of this one and we will give it parameter two tabs.

89
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:22.040
And here I will give the double value to 5.0.

90
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:37.400
And again I'll write the anchor pen and set left anchor and here I will write tabs and here we will

91
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:45.950
write the 5.0 the thing with the previous one and again I will call the anchor, been here and set the

92
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:54.140
right anchor here and write the tabs and I will give the value, same as previous.

93
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.750
It has to be the same with the previous one.

94
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:07.130
And again I will call the anchor pane here and set top left right and you need for the button add button.

95
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:17.030
So what we will do call the set top anchor again for particular we need the add button and what we will

96
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:22.160
do, the double value we will give is the 7.0 part.

97
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.740
Now we have to call this thing Anchor Bean.

98
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.940
And again, I will try to settle, right?

99
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.020
So the button will be in the right hand.

100
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:43.790
So I will write anchor because the reload, the back and the forehead are in the left part.

101
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:49.730
So here we will take the right anchor and right add button and give the double value.

102
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.250
Do not 10.0.

103
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.190
Afterwards we will go on the route and it's the border of a loop.

104
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.410
So set border.

105
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.970
And here we will write the new border.

106
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:12.330
And here the new border struck.

107
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.060
Okay.

108
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.480
So we are is this true part?

109
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.230
This one here, we will get the first value.

110
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.430
What?

111
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.600
The name argument.

112
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.000
Then the value top stroke and the paint stroke and the border stroke.

113
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.450
Strike the right style or the bottom style or the top style and then the lab style and everything which

114
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.560
we will give here.

115
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.440
So firstly, we will give the colour part colour.

116
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.670
We will set it to the white.

117
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.770
So here the right colour.

118
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:53.730
And another thing which you will need the border stroke strike so border stroke style and set it to

119
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.500
the non.

120
00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:08.340
And another thing which we will need here is the corner radii or lower this one corner area and set

121
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.040
it to the empty this one.

122
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.120
And again I will call the border of it.

123
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.310
So I will write new border words.

124
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.600
This one, and I will give it to the zero.

125
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:31.410
No, we don't need anything else, so we will simply delete this.

126
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.230
I'm done with this part.

127
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:40.290
Now what we will do afterwards, we need the primary app.

128
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.560
So we create our primary key.

129
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.060
So here I write the primary tab.

130
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.660
The song equals the new app.

131
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.730
And you know what I will do?

132
00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.210
I will write the new tab command.

133
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.510
New single page.

134
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.430
Which single page?

135
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.450
Class.

136
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:13.710
I need to single this one and don't get the box.

137
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.490
This one.

138
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.350
I'm done with this part.

139
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.560
And afterwards we write stamps and get stamps.

140
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.330
Only get that.

141
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.990
The observer list.

142
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.580
The observer list one.

143
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.940
So here what we need and then the primary term.

144
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.300
Of course, it will give it the argument with that.

145
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:48.230
And afterwards we need to get children here and not at all types.

146
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.030
I need all here what I will do.

147
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.890
Taps, comma, ad it will work or not.

148
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.870
We will see afterwards.

149
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.860
And then I will go with the border ban.

150
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.650
So here are border ban.

151
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:12.470
I have created an object of border ban and will right.

152
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.300
Simply call the new.

153
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.190
Marta.

154
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:22.910
Ben This one gives our human value to argument with the root part.

155
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.710
Semi-colon And afterward we will create a new object of scene.

156
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:34.600
One scene in the new scene on here.

157
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.090
What we will do, we will meet.

158
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.430
This is the scene class.

159
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.720
It's the container for all contained in a scene graph.

160
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.620
The background of the scene is filled as specified by the field property.

161
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:55.580
So here what we will do will simply give the argument of the border pen.

162
00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:04.700
This one closed that part and we will do the scene, not get.

163
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.860
We need the get stylesheet method.

164
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:18.080
It gives an observable list of screen URLs linking to the stylesheet to use with the scenes contained.

165
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:28.610
And here I will write add here we need to get class this one object.

166
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.270
It happens the specified element to the end of the list.

167
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:38.850
So it's not optional operation, but we have to go.

168
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.560
So here's what we will do.

169
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:49.340
We rewrite the cat resource and now what we need here.

170
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.490
Firstly, we need this.

171
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.860
I think this one.

172
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.450
Yeah.

173
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.370
This is style.

174
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.860
See this dark part?

175
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.530
This one.

176
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.410
So we have to link here.

177
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.780
So what we will do, we will write backslash.

178
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:12.740
The style ceases here and it will externally link to it.

179
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:20.990
So we will write the external form and it simply appends the specified element to the end of the list

180
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.880
and external with that.

181
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:34.210
And afterwards we have to call the primary stage here the spot and not set.

182
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:40.180
See now what we are doing.

183
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:49.100
Firstly here this the primary stage for this application under which the application scene, this one

184
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.450
scene can be set.

185
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:57.440
So applications may create other pages or I mean the stages if needed, but they will not be the primary

186
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.130
stages.

187
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.770
So here we will give its argument to the scene.

188
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:14.330
It's already and what we will do again, we will call the primary stage dot and we will set title and

189
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.920
what we will write.

190
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.780
We have to go over title.

191
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:26.030
So I will write our browser name sample sorry, the symbol browser.

192
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.560
Right, the simple browser here.

193
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.030
And it's done.

194
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.920
It's done.

195
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.230
And now we have all the primary stage.

196
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:49.160
Not sure this will call our last thing and it will show the output of our window.

197
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.450
So here I have created all the things which we need.

198
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:58.850
Now we have to run our project and we will see if it shows any error.

199
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.610
But I don't see any error right now.

200
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:08.480
So we will see if it shows any external error or something.

201
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.880
So simply we.

202
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.140
I can do that on.

203
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:23.560
Simply done with the run as part and go with the job application and do it with the mean and.

204
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.460
Okay.

205
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.050
Okay, proceed.

206
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.920
Also previous one on.

207
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.060
This one is the last.

208
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.670
So here we have got our output.

209
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.640
It is the simple browser we have created.

210
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:43.950
Here we have seen this back button, the forward button and the reload button.

211
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:52.680
It's our URL text field which we have created, and this one is the add button created which creates

212
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.690
a new tab.

213
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.980
So when we click this, we get the new tab already written.

214
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.900
We have already done this thing.

215
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.670
And what we will do, you will see the action.

216
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:11.340
Even also here when I am going to that button, it's normally pressed.

217
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.570
When I press this you will see the padding.

218
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.500
Everything is changing and the transparent color is also changing.

219
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.140
So here I'm pressing this button.

220
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.220
Here you will see and the reload function is well working.

221
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:34.800
So when I search something this thing you will see this loads reload.

222
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.920
When I go back it simply goes back and then I will click forward.

223
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.800
It simply goes forward where I have been.

224
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.870
So back, forward, reload.

225
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:53.460
Everything is working and this is how our sample browser is created and that's doing.

226
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:55.170
This is our.
