1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,610
So here I have the Czech, Czech one coalition matter, which was created to ensure that those who command

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,560
our baggage do not pass the ball.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,590
There are four types of collision.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,310
These first one is the left, another is right on the top.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,380
And the bottom collision here and now, the Czech back collision matter.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,710
It will more involved in our game here.

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:34,130
A package can collide with a ball or with an object or with another package.

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:41,450
The baggage can be moved only if it collides with a soccer one and does not collide with another baggage

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,960
on a ball and the baggage is moved.

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,820
It is time to check if the level is completed.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,550
My calling is completed matter.

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,010
So here we are calling that matter.

13
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,190
Now what we have to do the is completed matter check if the level is completed or not.

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,930
So we get the number of x.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:08,870
We compare that with the x and y coordinates of all the x and the destination areas where it's time

16
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,610
to complete the body of this completed method.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,050
So here we take in

18
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,000
number of bags.

19
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:30,500
Okay, so here I will take and Max, which will be equal to max, not size here.

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,490
Okay.

21
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,770
Now we need another variable to check.

22
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,600
The game is finished or not.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:53,410
So here I will write in finished bags the truly equal to zero here and now we need a for loop.

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:02,110
So here I will take four and here I is equal to zero.

25
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:09,400
I should be less than two and backs and I plus plus

26
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,510
seven.

27
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,360
I will write baggage by equal to bag stored.

28
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,690
Get our thing next, of course.

29
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:31,800
Next thing, which we take another for loop with the jet variable which will set it to zero and should

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,310
be less than two number of bags here and we should be used to increment.

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,490
Now we need to.

32
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:49,570
Area, area which will be equal to areas toward GATT.

33
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,950
Now, the G8 annex here and here.

34
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,470
I will check the condition.

35
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,940
It will get the number of bags and we compare here the X and the Y coordinates of all the bags and the

36
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,440
destination areas.

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,320
So it will be checked with the f loop.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,110
So here I will write if not x here.

39
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:27,200
If X coordinate of the back is equal to area dot x coordinate and need the backdoor to y.

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,790
Is equal to India.

41
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,470
Not why here.

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,220
So what it will do?

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,380
It will finished.

44
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,840
Bags set it to.

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:57,170
It will be plus one equal to one here.

46
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,750
Okay.

47
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:01,920
So.

48
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,510
Okay, so this part is done.

49
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,410
Now, what can we do after that?

50
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,530
If the finished mag is rest, stop.

51
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,600
Okay, so here.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,560
What we have here is complete in matter.

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,570
Check of the level is completed.

54
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:28,570
So here we have got the number of packs and here we compare it with the x and y coordinates of all packs

55
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,340
and the destination areas.

56
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:37,810
So now when the game is finished, so the finished bag variable here equals total number of packs in

57
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,550
the game.

58
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
So it will here I will write if

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,910
X is equal to.

60
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,910
And Max, it will is completed here.

61
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:03,170
Set it to true first and then we need to repaint matter also.

62
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:12,810
So to restart that game and now we have the game is finished when the finished bag is equal to the number

63
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,130
of bag in the game.

64
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,120
So now what we have to do, if we do some bad move, we can restart that level.

65
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,670
So for that we have created a restart level material.

66
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,310
So here I will write first.

67
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,020
Firstly, areas not clear.

68
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,880
Next thing mastered.

69
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,080
Clear.

70
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,500
Next thing is, we all start clear.

71
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:48,140
Now, what we need is our main initial game will matter.

72
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,730
Okay.

73
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:59,310
So we need the initial material and check it for if it is completed.

74
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:09,670
Then here what it should say is completed will be invariable to the false.

75
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:18,130
So if we do some bad, we can restart that level and we delete all the objects from the list and initiate

76
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:26,560
the world again by calling this method initial world and that is completed variable set to the false

77
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,980
here.

78
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,340
This is our main board class.

79
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,880
Now we have to make the actor class.

80
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,620
In which we have to write all these bodies.
