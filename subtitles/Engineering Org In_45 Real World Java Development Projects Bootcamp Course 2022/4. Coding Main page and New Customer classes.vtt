WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.140
So here's the project java file they defined inside the package electricity.

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.000
As same as that we have imported the necessary packages of AWP and swing class.

3
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.900
Then we have created the class project, which is extending the frame and implementing the actual listener

4
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.070
X listener.

5
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.710
Then we have initialize a string type of instance named as Mita, created the constructor by passing

6
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.360
the meter and the person is string named as person, so that will be electricity billing system as the

7
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.900
heading.

8
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.900
Now this load meter is equals to meter.

9
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.510
So this the current instance of meter is assigned to the past instance of meter.

10
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:57.540
This will be passed to the meter instance of a string type whenever the project will be called by the

11
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.480
other Java classes setting the size of the window.

12
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.420
Now this portion is for the adding image.

13
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.120
First of all, we have initialize the image icon.

14
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.280
Then we will create.

15
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.270
We have created the image icon with the desired size and the scale and stance.

16
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.140
Then we will have image icon.

17
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.150
Another image icon, adding that image icon to the label.

18
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.640
And then we have added that label to the frame.

19
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.770
Now this is the first column that is a menu bar.

20
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.000
So it is a menu bar of the window.

21
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.210
So our frame contains menu bar as well.

22
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.270
So this will be initializing the menu.

23
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.730
After that, there is a menu named Master.

24
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.860
Its name is Master and we have initialize the menu here.

25
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.870
Now menu item.

26
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.880
There are four items for the new customer.

27
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.200
Customer details.

28
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.550
Deposit details.

29
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.350
Calculate build.

30
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.580
We have initialized one by one as and one and two and three and four.

31
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.540
Setting the foreground color for the master as dot blue.

32
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.600
So the menu color will be as dark blue.

33
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.280
Blue color will be off the menu.

34
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.650
Now this portion is for the customer detail.

35
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.970
So first set the font of the customer detail and then if you have inserted an image again setting the

36
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.770
scale instance of the image, setting the icon by using the image on the MX one button.

37
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.570
It is a sorry menu item and one is a menu item and setting that image to the menu item, then setting

38
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:38.410
the menu on make of the menu item and accelerator keystroke, which is used whenever we press that to

39
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.460
the menu item.

40
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:50.950
So it will perform key event on the action event control mask as these are the methods and attributes

41
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.660
for the get keystroke method.

42
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.660
And then we have said that the menu item color is white background.

43
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.370
This is for the meta retail.

44
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.820
Similarly, as we have did in customer detail, this is the major detail for setting the font image

45
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.380
icon creating.

46
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.580
It's a scaled instance.

47
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.470
Adding that image icon to the menu item and setting its metronomic and setting is accelerator accelerator

48
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.840
as getting keystrokes which will handle the key events and setting as back as white.

49
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.220
Similarly, for the deposit details, we have did the same thing and.

50
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:40.740
After that we have static for the fourth one fourth menu item using the icon image and similarly added

51
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.540
the background color as white.

52
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.980
Now we have added all the four menu items, adds add action listener as they will perform any event.

53
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.330
So that's why we have added the action listener and pass the current object.

54
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.840
Second column will contain another menu.

55
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.950
Named as information and menu item will be informal and info to so information on the basis of you have

56
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.650
designed informal info to first is updated information.

57
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.690
The second information now we have setting the foreground color for the info is as read.

58
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.520
So it will be shown in red color.

59
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.380
Now here the table.

60
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.530
Similarly, as we have did for the previous setting the image.

61
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.450
Adding that image to the menu item and for the key stroke.

62
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.460
Handling the key events and background color for similarly for the last build method adding both to

63
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.000
the add action listeners so that they can perform event and another venue is user menu.

64
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.510
The two items are table and build details, setting the foreground color as read the resolution in red

65
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.110
also.

66
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.200
Similarly for the people, we have said all the things for the last will we have do all the things and

67
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.550
I did that to the menu item, adding both to the add action listener.

68
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.070
Now for the third column, there is a report.

69
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.770
Menu which will have a single menu item generate bill.

70
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.050
Its colour is blue.

71
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.670
And then this.

72
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:16.130
For this report we have or do the same thing, adding an image and keystroke and getting the background

73
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.070
colour as white and then adding the image listener to the actual menu item.

74
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.140
Now we have a menu named utility.

75
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.450
Inside the utility we have three choices, three menu items as notepad, calculator and web browser.

76
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.490
It's the colour is as red and here's the calendar.

77
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.950
Uh.

78
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.230
So this is a menu image, scale and stance.

79
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.370
It's a new image icon and similarly background color as well.

80
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.180
Similarly, for the calculator as the image icon and everything we have added.

81
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.430
And similarly for the web browser, we also have performed adding the image listener to all the menu

82
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.180
items off a utility menu.

83
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.400
Now we have X starts at font.

84
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.150
We are setting for the exit button.

85
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.410
I can afford that.

86
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.320
And little keystroke and adding dimension to that button.

87
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.780
Now we have added and one and two and three and four to the master menu.

88
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.650
And added info and info to the info menu added when you treat the user menu.

89
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.660
Added R one in the report menu and added duty.

90
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:32.910
You want to add three in the utility menu and exit button x x to the exit menu.

91
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.570
Now if person is goes to admin now if the person is equals to admin so it will add master to the menu,

92
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.460
we will add a master to the menu other end.

93
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:50.250
Otherwise if the customer then we will add info, user and report and utility and exit will be common

94
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.910
for both.

95
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.770
Then we have set the menu bar.

96
00:06:52.770 --> 00:07:00.630
So this will set the complete menu font for the menu and its layout is flow layout and its visibility

97
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.760
settings for default.

98
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.730
Then there is action performed method which we have described here.

99
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.840
A string message will get the message from the action.

100
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.560
If the message equals customer detail, it will call the customer detail class.

101
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.750
If the message is a new customer, it will call new customer class similarly for calculate bill payable.

102
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.100
If it is not paid, then it will execute the notepad z file.

103
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.820
I.

104
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.150
If I don't able to execute then it will catch the exception.

105
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.380
Similarly for the calculator, I will open the calculator like z file.

106
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.240
Similarly for the web browser as well.

107
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.950
Now for logout, it will set the visibility of the current window as false and call the login class

108
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.730
for the generate.

109
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.960
But it will call the generate build class and set this visibility as true for the deposit.

110
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.600
But it will call the deposit will detail deposit details similarly for the web information, update

111
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.500
information and build details and at the main function we have created it.

112
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.590
Instance, new project and setting is visibility.

113
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.810
Current window is true.

114
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.840
Now we will move to the new customer java file.

115
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.910
So here is the package.

116
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:11.230
Electricity inside again importing the similarly package for swimming and JWT and SQL.

117
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.030
Now new customer will have extending the frame and implementing Excel.

118
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.370
There is the global instance.

119
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:17.850
Labels are.

120
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:25.470
There is L1, L2, L, three and four and five, six, seven, eight and 11 and text 22, 33, three,

121
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.610
45, 67 and G button be one and no new customer.

122
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:36.060
It is a constructor setting the location for the window, its size initializing panel, setting its

123
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:46.230
layout, background color white and setting its background color as new color that is not title label

124
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:52.590
providing as new customer setting the bound, setting its font type family and its size.

125
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.850
Adding that title to the panel.

126
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.160
There is the new label as customer name setting.

127
00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.910
It's bound.

128
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:07.170
Now it's text field setting the bound, adding that to the panel, adding the text field to the panel.

129
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.450
First, adding a label to the panels, then adding text to the panel.

130
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:18.750
Similarly, for the meter number first and creating bound for the meter number, initializing the label

131
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:27.570
bounding for the label, adding the label and it's adding the meter number and its label respectively

132
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.670
for the address.

133
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:36.270
Similarly, we have date label and text field for the city label and text field for the state label

134
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:43.590
and text field for the email label and text field for the phone number label and text field similarly

135
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.690
and for the button here is the next button and setting the bound for the button.

136
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.220
Then there is a cancel button, setting the button for the cancel button, setting the background of

137
00:09:53.220 --> 00:10:00.900
buttons black and white and background foreground button for B1 and B2, adding that button to the panels,

138
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.600
setting the layout as border layout and adding the P equals to center.

139
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:16.140
So panel will be at the center now image icon that will be image icon setting in the label l eight as

140
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.880
and it will be set as best.

141
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.790
So the image will be shown at the West Side, get content and setting background.

142
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.310
A lot of the whole window has by adding the event listener to the both buttons.

143
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.820
We went in B and a new random long first is first.

144
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.150
It is a long type of variable and it is next long.

145
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.240
This is done to generate a random number.

146
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.740
So here it will execute the value of the first dot using dot dot epsilon.

147
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:50.310
So it will set the text of the meter number as fixed, which is generated by the random using random

148
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.540
class as a random number.

149
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.310
Now here is an action performed.

150
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:04.770
If a dot get so close to one, if the B1 event is occurred, then we will fetch text from the t one.

151
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:13.980
Its meter number, its meter number, its address, its state setting email and phone number.

152
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:20.670
Then we'll execute the Cuban query by providing all the details, name, meter, address, city, state,

153
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:27.060
email and phone number and the Q to query insert into login values and also inserting into the login

154
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.460
values meter and the respective details.

155
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.370
Now inside the try, we have initialized the connection executing the Cuban and category.

156
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.670
So we have to add the customer well in the customer table as well as in the login table.

157
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:44.370
So after the adding in the login table, customer will have to sign up and set as password.

158
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:53.370
Then he will be able to login into the our project and billing system.

159
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.590
So this will show our dialog box as customer details added successfully.

160
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:08.520
Setting the visibility of this will be false and this will print show the visibility of meter info class

161
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.210
as true.

162
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.810
Now this catch block will be and link the exception.

163
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.280
If the button will be B2, then this will simply close the current file here.

164
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.270
The main function we have defined the new customer set visibility as true.

165
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.170
So this is all about this in file.

166
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.980
So let me show you the run.

167
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.360
How it looked like when it run projects.

168
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:38.790
It will look like this in the information part, you will have those user part report utility and log

169
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.060
out.

170
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.230
So this is the electricity billing system and new customer part.

171
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.760
When we will run this new customer file, it will look like this.

172
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.310
So this will be added by the admin.

173
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:55.860
So when we run this complete project in our last video, we will know about how this things will be

174
00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.000
working relatively so.

175
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.880
These are all the two files we have.

176
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.410
Understand this video.
