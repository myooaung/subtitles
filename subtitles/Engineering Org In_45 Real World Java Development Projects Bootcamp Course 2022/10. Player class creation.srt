1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,350
So next class which we have to create a supplier class.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:14,070
Here we will take the soccer player and that player according with the cursor.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,650
So here what I will do.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,700
Mostly clear class extends the actor class here.

5
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:33,520
And the next thing which we need so here we need a public constructor first.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,030
Player and it should take the input y and into x coordinates.

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:52,710
Under that we will take super apparent class holding on.

8
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,440
I will pass x comma y here and make.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,810
My third initial player.

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,180
I'm done.

11
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,580
This will set the image of our soccer player first.

12
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,230
So here I have to create and set the image of our player.

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,650
So here I will write image icon.

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,880
Icon equal to a new image.

15
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,840
I couldn't.

16
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,910
And under that I will give the part of my image.

17
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:49,640
CRC Resources, which has the name so combined that Bianchi and no image image is equal to icon.

18
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,710
Get image.

19
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,010
Get image and learn.

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Next thing we have to set the image here.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,510
So.

22
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,150
So we have centered our image.

23
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,460
Now we have to move the player.

24
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,050
That is so cool.

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,710
So to move matter moves the object inside the world.

26
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:29,080
So here I have the end x and the end y argument here on the right and the x equal to x and plus x here

27
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,240
in the y.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,740
Equal to y.

29
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,530
Y plus y.

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:49,850
Say the x the x here, set the Y with the D line here and then next thing.

31
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,220
Okay, so this part is done.

32
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:02,310
We already set and take the coordinates of our movement and this will move our object inside the world

33
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:02,720
here.

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,590
Next thing which we have to create is a baggage or Java class here.
