1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,890
So here is our home Java file, which will appear after successful login in our login page.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,870
So this home dot java is defined inside the package travel and we have imported the necessary packages.

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,900
After that there is a defined the class which is extending frame instead of is there instance a string

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,680
username?

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:35,730
After that in the main function, main function or method of this class, we have called the new home

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,440
with null values as a parameter and setting the visibility as true.

7
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,050
Then there is a public home, a string username.

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,540
Then we had a detestable end to his management and said the username as the correct instance for color

9
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,200
layout.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,670
After that we have.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,490
Created an image added into the label and set that into our frame.

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,450
After that, we have created the label for the Travel and Tourism Management Forum.

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:09,200
A lot of it font off it bound for it, adding that to our added that also to our label.

14
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,390
And then we have created a menu bar instance set that menu bar.

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,730
After that we have added menu element customer foreground color as blue added that to our menubar.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,990
After that, we have set the menu items inside the.

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,130
Customer menu items will be first at customer update.

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,220
Customer details, have customer details and delete customer details.

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,700
After that we have added action listener on all of these menu events.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,360
So for me one that will be add customer.

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,810
So inside that customer action performance event, we have called the ADD Customer class bypassing the

22
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,940
username and set the visibility as to.

23
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,800
After that, if our.

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,840
Update customer.

25
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,330
We have defined the action performance method and call the update customer class.

26
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,970
Set the visibility as to.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,990
Similarly for the customer, we have called the view customers class inside the action performed event

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,730
and inside the action listener of the delete customer menu event.

29
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:26,750
We have called the delete customer class and then we have defined another menu that is a package menu

30
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,650
for calories.

31
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,900
Read added that to our menu well then defined its three items check package, book package and view

32
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,540
package.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,690
For the check package we have called the check package inside the Excel listener for the book package,

34
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,720
we have called the book package Inside the Action Listener and for the view package, we have called

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,050
the package class inside the list.

36
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,900
And then there is another menu, the element as hotel for color calories blue and added that to our

37
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,400
menu bar.

38
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:01,400
It contains three element items as well both hotels we hotels and we booked hotels for the book hotels

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:08,030
we have called the book hotel class and inside the Excelsior and for the hotel we have called the check

40
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,330
hotels class inside the accent list.

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,530
After that, we have called.

42
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:21,410
We booked hotel class inside the hotel menu item access, and then we have added another menu as payment

43
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,600
and set the menu items.

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,500
Pay the payment.

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,330
Add that to the menu item.

46
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,060
And for that particular menu item defined the action upon which will call the new payment class.

47
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,450
And then we have another menu as the utility setting the foreground, color as red, adding that to

48
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,040
a menu bar.

49
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:47,450
Then it will have two items notepad and calculator and defining action performed on notepad and calculator.

50
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,350
So notepad will open.

51
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,480
The notepad calculator will open the calculator.

52
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,440
After that there is another menu seven which is for the about.

53
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,520
So.

54
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,600
This will just call the about page and setting the extended frame.

55
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,220
This will extend the frames and visibility through and background color as white.

56
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,550
Now we will be having a look on add customer java file so package it is defined inside the package travel

57
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,950
and java .8. bottom layout.

58
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,430
It will setup for the bottom layout.

59
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,410
We have imported the necessary packages.

60
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,240
After that we have defined that customer class, extending the frame connection as null prepared statement

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,700
as null private panel.

62
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,550
Text fills combo box and radio buttons.

63
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,240
Then inside the main function, we have called our class and set the visibility of the frame as to after

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,140
that inside the parameter constructor of that customer we have.

65
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,990
Set the bond.

66
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,790
And then we set up initialize the panel and its properties.

67
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:07,170
After that, we have added an image with the help of the label, and then there is the label new customer

68
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,710
setting font for it, bound for it, and adding that to our panel under the label as user name, it

69
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,780
says back to text field ID for ID.

70
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,090
There is a combo box which is containing the string passport, Aadhaar card, voter ID and rival access.

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,040
Similarly, for the another label that is number respective text field for the number, then there is

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,470
a name respective text field for the name.

73
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,790
After that, there is a gender labeled as gender.

74
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,840
For which we have radio buttons.

75
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,000
First is male and second is female.

76
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,500
Then there is the label country for which we have a text field respect to t three.

77
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,430
Then there is a.

78
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,310
Labor reserve room number.

79
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,450
Named as permanent address.

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,350
That's the label name reserved room ll be reserved room number that will not affect the label as permanent

81
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,190
address setting bound for it added to text field for that particular label.

82
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,610
Then there is another label for the phone number.

83
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,960
Adding text feel to it.

84
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,780
Then there's the label email, setting it and adding text filter for the email.

85
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,290
And then there is inside the try block.

86
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,810
We have initialize the connection executed the query select x2 from customer where username is equals

87
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:28,110
to username while are start next we will set the text as username and name and after that there is a

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,390
button new button which will add.

89
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,150
So when we click on add then it will call initialize the connection with the database set radio as null

90
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,880
if asked is selected if the selected is male or then we will set the radio as male.

91
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,000
If our to selected then we we'll set the radio as female.

92
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,530
After that, inside the try block, we have fetched all the required information from the respective

93
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,780
text filter and combo box and we have created the query insert into customer values which will help

94
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:02,820
us to insert values of the customer which we have just inserted by in our text file and combo box.

95
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,660
We will then execute update that query and show that the customer added successfully.

96
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,130
After that we.

97
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,040
Then we have.

98
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,950
But I knew that setting bond for it.

99
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,180
Background color for it.

100
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,110
Heading that button to our panel.

101
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,800
Then there is a button exit for which we have performed, action performed.

102
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,140
Setting the visibility of the current window as false and setting bound background for foreground color

103
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,420
for that button, then adding that button to a frame, setting the background color of the frame as

104
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,320
white.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,910
Now let's have a look on update customer class.

106
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:47,540
So this is the update customer class, which is defined inside the package travel, importing the necessary

107
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:54,770
packages, update customer class connection, statement, prepared nerd and a private panel content

108
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,010
pane.

109
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:00,830
And there is a ten text fields inside the main function we have called our current class object customer

110
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,200
and set the visibility of the frame as true.

111
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:11,210
Then we have initialized a parameterized constructor for which we have defined image by the help of

112
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,720
label.

113
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,900
After setting the bound of the label, we have edited that to frame.

114
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,550
Then there is a label name update, customer setting font for it, bound for it, and adding that to

115
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,180
our panel.

116
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,140
Then there is the label username for which we have a respective text field.

117
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:31,860
Similarly for there is a ID label for with respect to which we have a text field, then there is a label

118
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,900
number for with respect to which we have text field and there is a label name for respect.

119
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,620
We will have a text field in respect of that table and then there is a label gender.

120
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:52,740
With respect to we have a text field and then there is a country and text field for it.

121
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,770
There is a permanent address text field for it.

122
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,930
Then there is a phone number, text field for it, and there is an email text field for it.

123
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,220
Then inside the block we have initialized the connection and executed the as to from customer where

124
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,110
it is invisible to username and we will set the information in our text fields.

125
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,940
All the nine text fields.

126
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,770
Then we will for the radio button.

127
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,280
So the button that is update button, we will define here the action performed for which we have initialized

128
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,960
the connection inside the block.

129
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,160
We have a store, the information from the text field on our strings respective in strings and created

130
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,530
the SQL statement.

131
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,770
So which will that is update customer set ID type that will the statement which will be executed by

132
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,220
using the connection class instance and the statement instance.

133
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,200
Then there is a.

134
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,850
The dialog box which will appear customer details updated successfully and after that we have.

135
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:01,640
Set the new button down, adding background color, foreground color and added that button to our panel.

136
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,260
After that, there is a bag button for which we have defined the action, perform the event, setting

137
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,690
the visibility as false.

138
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,950
Then there is an exit button setting foreground background color for that button that is black foreground

139
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,080
color for that button that is white and.

140
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,550
Added that Britain to Spain.

141
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,000
Then there is a get content paints at background color as white.

142
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,940
So these are the three classes.

143
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,850
Let me show you the output of these three classes.

144
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,990
So first is home class, which will appear after the successful login.

145
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,750
So I will be showing you by running this file.

146
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,280
So I will run this home file.

147
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,040
This is how the home file will look like.

148
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,340
As we have defined these menu elements inside customer we have four menu items ahead.

149
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,380
Customer Update Customer View Customer Delete Customer And inside package we have check package book

150
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:56,550
package will package hotels, hotels, waters and the bug totals inside payment pay the payment utility

151
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,450
notepad and calculator and add about will show as to about this.

152
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,310
App.

153
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,870
Now let's close this.

154
