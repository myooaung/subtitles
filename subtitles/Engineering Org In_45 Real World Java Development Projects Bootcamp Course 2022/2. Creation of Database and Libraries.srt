1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,400
So here is our MySQL command line client and the required notepad file.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,020
So let's write the password first.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,510
I will be writing my password of my SQL.

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,810
So I have validated the password.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,550
Then the notepad file says that execute these queries one by one in your MySQL console.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,530
The first query creates the database with name as AMS.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,140
So I have already created the database and inserted the values so that not much of the time should be

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,020
taken in this value in this video.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:44,210
So I will just do just to show you, I will create another database with the name as a amms one because

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,190
I have already created the database with the name Amms.

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,590
So let's copy this from notepad here and here.

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,220
Control Tesla.

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,600
I'll be editing it as a CMS one because same database can't be created twice.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,840
So I will be creating create database ams one hidden.

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,170
So this is showing.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,740
Okay, one refactored.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,410
Now we have to use the database.

18
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,680
So using ams control plus c.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,900
We have to edit AMS one.

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,820
Database chains.

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,210
Now we have to create tables.

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,400
So first table is a cancellation table which will hold all the cancellation record of the table.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,750
So it's controlled.

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,440
Let's see.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,180
So it says create table name.

26
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,860
Table name will be cancellation.

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,800
First column will be P and R number.

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,810
Second will be cancellation.

29
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:51,190
Number third is cancellation date and fourth is flight code for which flight ticket has been cancelled.

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,920
So let's hit enter set showing query.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,160
Okay.

32
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,390
Zero rules affected.

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,820
Now let's create.

34
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,530
Another table here it is showing create table flight.

35
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,840
So let's copy that query to create table flight.

36
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,270
And pasting it here.

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,530
So this query will create a table flight.

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:31,240
With columns like F Code F name, flight code, flight name and its source.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,780
Or you can say.

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,750
Starting station or location and destination.

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,750
That will be the final location where the flight will land.

42
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,180
So let's get into that.

43
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,920
Showing that database has a table has been created.

44
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,580
Query is zero rows affected.

45
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,050
Now let's create another table from our notepad file.

46
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,970
Another table is.

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,920
We have created the flight table now.

48
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,930
First database.

49
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,690
Use database.

50
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,600
Create the table.

51
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,470
We have created the table cancellation.

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,730
Created the table file.

53
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,310
And now we will create the table login for the login of the admin.

54
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,660
So copy this query.

55
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,370
Wasting it here.

56
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,960
So this query will create a table named as log in with the first column as username type of a string

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,980
and the size of 22nd as password type of work, which will work similarly like a strings in programming

58
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,870
languages and.

59
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,420
Size is 20.

60
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,390
Then let's attend into.

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,360
So it is showing that table has been created and with zero rules.

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,110
Then we have to create a table with a name as passenger.

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,730
So let's copy the passenger table query from here.

64
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,790
Copy this query.

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,660
So we have pasted the query.

66
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,950
Let's see.

67
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,290
Creating the table name as passenger.

68
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,780
Attribute has been our number.

69
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,450
Then there is an address.

70
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,850
Then there is the nationality of the passenger passenger name, passenger gender, passenger phone number,

71
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,190
passport number, and then the flight code for which the passenger will be travelling.

72
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,010
That's the table passenger.

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,150
Let's hit enter.

74
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,050
So table passenger has been created successfully.

75
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,950
Remember that I have already created and inserted the value.

76
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,830
So I will be just showing after the creation of this table so that you can create on your own.

77
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,530
Now let's create the table.

78
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,710
Next table is paytm payment table.

79
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,450
So let's copy this.

80
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,640
Based it.

81
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,000
So this query is showing like create table namespace.

82
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,860
Attribute Size.

83
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,760
Piano Number.

84
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,810
Phone number.

85
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,830
Check number.

86
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,420
Card number.

87
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,050
Amount paid date of the payment.

88
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,990
So these are the columns of the attributes.

89
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,870
Let's press enter.

90
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,650
So it is showing that the table has been created named as payment.

91
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,740
Now we have to create a table of reservation type.

92
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,910
So let's copy that as well from the notepad file.

93
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,080
And pasted her.

94
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,320
So the square will create a table named as a reservation with attributes.

95
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:12,490
Panel number Ticket ID Flight Code Journey, Date Journey, Time Source and destination.

96
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,470
Now let's get into so the reservation table has been created.

97
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:24,220
Now, the last table is a sector table which will use for the flights control plus.

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,820
Based here.

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,160
So all the tables has been created now, but I have already created the database with the original name

100
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,200
that is AMS.

101
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:42,930
But this is the virtual database which I have created to for you to understand how the tables will be

102
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,650
created.

103
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,200
So let me show you that database, which I have created.

104
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:55,680
So I will be changing the database from here to use AMS because I have already created that.

105
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,660
So it shows the database change.

106
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,680
Now I will show you the tables in this database show.

107
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,500
Tables.

108
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,880
So tables in EMS are the same, which I have just created for the virtuality.

109
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,410
Cancellation Flight Login Passenger Payment, Payment Reservation and sector.

110
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,800
Now let me show you the details, which I have added in my database, which I have created.

111
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,690
Values I have inserted.

112
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:28,890
So for that I will be writing query likes select as strict from.

113
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,440
For stimulus cancellation.

114
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,520
Cancellation.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,040
So this is the cancellation record.

116
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:46,640
There is one record because I have checked for once by running my project as well.

117
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,240
So for that, the one record has been added.

118
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,970
We will be showing by cancelling more tickets than the record will be reflecting in this database as

119
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,280
well.

120
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,120
Second one, let's check for the flight.

121
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,300
Selector strip from flight.

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,620
Flight table.

123
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,050
So here it is.

124
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,310
So I have added these file flights.

125
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,580
There are five flights and source and destination of all.

126
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,980
Let's check for the log in.

127
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,180
Uh, log in.

128
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,040
What is there in the log in table?

129
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,030
So in long table there is only one username and password that is admin and password as one, two, three,

130
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:33,650
four which using which we will be logging in to our desktop based application.

131
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,480
The other table is passenger payment, reservation and sector.

132
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,850
So let's look at the passenger table.

133
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,310
Sarcastic gastric from passenger.

134
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,950
So here's the passenger table.

135
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,760
Let me.

136
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,050
So that you can see clearly.

137
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:02,510
Here is the passenger table two passenger I waited for to check that the project is working efficiently

138
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,050
or not.

139
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,250
After that passenger there is will be a payment table as well.

140
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,390
Yeah, payment, reservation and sector.

141
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,850
Let's check the payment table.

142
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,670
Payment table.

143
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,820
So there is a one payment added also.

144
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,430
And after payment, there will be a reservation table.

145
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,180
The reservation table check what's there in the reservation.

146
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:36,060
So I have added five reservations already in my table, which will be used to when we will be going

147
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,130
to run this project at the last video.

148
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,220
For the complete run.

149
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,170
The last will be sector table, which will be used for the flights.

150
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,050
So let's have a look on that sector.

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
So sector table contains this information.

152
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,590
Now I will be moving on to our ID.

153
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,750
So let's have a look how the database is.

154
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,110
This database is connecting with our project, which is a common class of.

155
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,480
Our first forward, this project that is an airline management system.

156
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,950
So let's have a look on that.

157
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,780
So here is our ID.

158
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,870
That is a NetBeans ID.

159
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:23,460
I am using 12.6 thousand of this ID for that I have using JDK 17, which is compatible with it.

160
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,600
There is an address to Exemplar File which we'll be using for the format tables in this project and

161
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,900
the MySQL Connector, which will help us to load the drivers, which will help us to connect with our

162
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,750
database so that we can manage the trip and update information in our database.

163
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,560
So there is a so first package airline inside which we have our classes and I can insert which we have

164
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,430
our images.

165
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,230
So let's have a look at the first file.

166
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,450
So it is defined inside the package airline.

167
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:02,910
We have imported the Java aspect package which will help us to use necessary methods and drivers to

168
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,140
connect with our database.

169
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:11,010
We have defined the class cone instance variable of type connection and stance, a level of type statement

170
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,920
inside the non parameter as constructor of the class.

171
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,300
We have defined the cache block and inside the trie cache block.

172
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,370
Inside the trip log we have class stored for name on my SQL driver.

173
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,830
This will help us to load the drivers, which will be connecting our program with the database.

174
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,170
So here the connection.

175
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,680
Variable in is initialized as driver manager don't get connection.

176
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:43,400
First argument is the location of a database, so that is GBK, MySQL and AMS.

177
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,360
And the second is the root, which is the username.

178
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,300
And the third argument is the password.

179
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,780
So my password is my square.

180
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,700
My square.

181
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,640
One, two, three.

182
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,970
Generally the default password and the username will be same as wrote root in a small case letter.

183
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,640
So if you don't have changed your MySQL command line password so that will be same as are odd.

184
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,730
So you will have to change that here to connect with your database.

185
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,840
Now statement variable we have initialize c create a statement using the connection instance and created

186
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,880
the statement instance which will be creating the statement and executing query further in our programs

187
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,150
and classes inside the cache block.

188
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,800
We have handled the exception by printing it out if any exception occurs.
