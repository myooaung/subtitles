1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.210
So in this video, we will be talking about the next three classes of this.

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.980
Project that is cab booking system.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.790
So first class is the sign up Java class.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.960
So this class is defined inside the package cab booking system and.

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.730
Then we have imported our necessary packages like import Java, JWT, Abstract Window Toolkit, which

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.630
will help us to create graphical user interface applications.

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.990
Then we have imported Java exporting Java SQL to connect with the database a DOT event, two handling

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.350
event or the button and import border to add border layout for this frame or window.

9
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.770
After that, we have defined our sign up clause, which is extending frame and implementing action inside

10
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.700
which we have defined the variable content.

11
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.450
There are four text fields.

12
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.810
We have defined text filled text one, two, three, and there is two buttons.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.820
One in between there is a one combo box.

14
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.560
Inside the main method we have called the instance of the current class.

15
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.500
That is a new sign up outside visible is also true.

16
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.100
After that we have defined the non parameter constructor for this class.

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.160
Set the bound for the frame as 600 comma two 5000 size will be seven across 406.

18
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.880
After that, we have defined a content pane as equals to new panel.

19
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.870
Set that border with the empty border and that to our content paint.

20
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.870
And then we said the background color as white and the layout as null.

21
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.120
After that, we have defined the label name.

22
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.760
We have set this foreground color as dark gray, its its font family and type its size.

23
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.120
Then we have set its location and after that we have added it to our content pane.

24
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.460
Similarly, we have another label of a label name.

25
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.240
It set its foreground color and its font type family and it's bound.

26
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.110
After that, we have added that to our content pane.

27
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.490
Similarly, we have there another label labeled as that is foreground color to dark gray.

28
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.230
It's font, family type and size.

29
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.330
And then we have set its location and size.

30
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.340
After that we have added that to our content pane.

31
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.880
Similarly, there is another label labeled as answer.

32
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.960
We have set its foreground color as dark gray, then it's font, family type and size.

33
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.920
Then we have added this location and size, then added it to our content pane.

34
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.570
Then there is a new combo box.

35
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.530
We have defined the model of Compubox with the help of a new default compubox model inside which there

36
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.030
is a new string array inside which we have installed all the security questions like your nickname,

37
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.000
your lucky number, your childhood superhero, your childhood name.

38
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.100
Then we have set the location and size for the combo box and added the combo box to our content pane.

39
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.560
After that, there is another label secure for the security question set its foreground color as dark

40
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.650
gray and its font type family and size.

41
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.760
After that, we have set this location and size and added that also to our content.

42
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.050
And then we have defined edited image, created image with the help of image icon and image objects.

43
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.550
Then we have added that image to our A label and set its location and size and added that label to our

44
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.630
frame frame also.

45
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.970
After that, we have defined a text field that is location and size.

46
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.990
After that, we have added that text file to our content pane and set its maximum limit to ten.

47
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.030
Similarly, we have there is another text field.

48
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.360
Text field when we have set maximum limit at ten for that text field and set its location and size and

49
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.770
added that to our content pane.

50
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.220
The similar thing we are we have did for the text field to set its maximum size and then after that

51
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.590
its location and.

52
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.580
Size, width and height after that, setting it to our content pane.

53
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.700
Similarly, there is a text field.

54
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.960
Three We have read the same things for the text fill three as well.

55
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.330
Then we have created a button one with a name as create adding a listener to the button setting, font

56
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.500
type family and size of that button setting the bound for the button, its location X and Y and its

57
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.730
width and height after that background color and foreground color for the button and adding that button

58
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.780
to our content pane.

59
00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.020
After that, we have defined two new button back, adding extra listener to that button and its one

60
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.890
type family size.

61
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.690
Then we have set the bound and location of that button, in fact, foreground and background color of

62
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.180
that button and adding that button to our content pane.

63
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.590
Then there's another panel setting its foreground color.

64
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.400
Inside the panel, we are adding the title bottle with the help of the line border and the new color

65
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.390
by passing the RGB values in the color, its name will be create account.

66
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.000
After that, what we are doing is we have set the location of the that panel in size, then background

67
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.440
color as white and add that to panel that panel to our content pane.

68
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.560
Then we have defined the action method which is taking an event argument inside which we have created

69
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.540
the instance of a token class.

70
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.890
And if the source of the event is from event, then we will fetch the required details into our string

71
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.070
variables from our the combo box and text field which we have created above.

72
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.440
After that, we have defined a string as well.

73
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.380
Inside, which we are creating the query to store the values into our account with respect to username

74
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.000
and password, question and answer.

75
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.770
Then we will be creating.

76
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.510
Executing the query with the help of context, not execute update query as well.

77
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.840
Then we will show the message dialog box that account created successfully.

78
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.520
And we will move the.

79
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.050
Control of the program to a new login file and set the visibility as to if the source of the content

80
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.090
is from the V1, then we will set the visibility of the current window as false and call the login window

81
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.530
and set the visibility as true.

82
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.640
Then we will ask the exception if any exceptions will occur.

83
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.680
So this is all about the signup page.

84
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.760
After the successful signup, it will move the control of the program to log in.

85
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.980
So let us move to the login page.

86
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.790
So here is the login file.

87
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.030
It is defined inside the package capture booking system.

88
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.300
We have imported the necessary package to provide a better graphical user interface and handling events

89
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.500
all the buttons and also connecting with the database.

90
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.270
After that, we have defined our login class, which is extending frame and implementing extend listener

91
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.810
inside which we have a panel of private of type private and there is a one text field, one password

92
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.810
field, and there are three buttons.

93
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.210
B1, B2 and B three inside the non parameterized constructor of this class.

94
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.560
We have set the background color by passing the RTB values, set the bound for that frame and after

95
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.100
that we set the layout as null and set the background color as white.

96
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.550
After that, we have loaded an image with the help of the class loader, and after that we have added

97
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.640
that image to a label and set the bound and location for that image and added that label to our frame.

98
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.870
After that, there is a label element which is labeled as username, setting its bound location and

99
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.450
size.

100
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.980
After that, what we are doing is adding that label to our L6 label.

101
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.840
Similarly, there is a label alto labeled as password.

102
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.560
We have set location and its size.

103
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.560
After that, we have added that label to our L six label.

104
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.270
Then there is a text field with respect to the user name setting bound for the text field.

105
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.390
420 comma zero is the x and y values and 157 plus 20 is the width and height values for that text field

106
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.070
and adding that text field to our label.

107
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:58.110
And six after that in the password field we have defined a password field setting location and size

108
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.960
for the password field, adding that password field to our label.

109
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.470
Six.

110
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.540
Similarly, there is a button for the login and adding that access to that button setting, for example,

111
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.100
bypassing RDB values and setting background color by passing the RGV values for the required color,

112
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.520
setting its location and size, and adding that button to our label.

113
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.820
After that, there is a button for the sign up adding extension to that button, setting the foreground

114
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.690
color of the button and background color of the button by passing RGB values with the help of a color

115
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.320
class.

116
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.460
After that, we are setting its bound location and size with the help of set down method and adding

117
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.440
that button to our label l6.

118
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.380
Now there is a button third, which is for forgot password.

119
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.550
After this class we will be discussing about the Forgot Password class, adding the action listener

120
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.450
to that class, setting the foreground color and the background color with the help of the color class,

121
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.690
and setting the bounds for that button which will help us to locate the button and setting its size.

122
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.580
After that, we have added that button to our frame.

123
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.370
Then there is another label, label five labeled as Trouble in login.

124
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.420
So this will be shown beside the forward password button.

125
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.040
Setting font, size, font, family type and size for that button, foreground and background color

126
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.260
setting bounds and adding that button to our label.

127
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.910
Now we have defined the action, performed a method inside which, if the source of the event is from

128
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.730
V1, then we will set the boolean variable false inside the type log.

129
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.350
We will creating the connection or creating the connection instance of our connection class.

130
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.820
Create a string query like select extra form account where username and password will match.

131
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.730
Then we will create a prepared statement and set the string.

132
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.870
Text field or text and password field.

133
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.700
Get text.

134
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.320
After that we will execute that query.

135
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.850
And if the query will match, then we will set the visibility of the current window as false and move

136
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.980
the control of the program to our home window.

137
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.210
If the password or username does not match, then we will show the message that invalid login or password.

138
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.950
Inside the back we will handle any exception if occurs.

139
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.320
If the source of the button is from beta, then we will set the visibility of the current window as

140
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.530
false and we will call the sign up class and set the visibility of sign up window as true the if the

141
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.940
source of the button is from beta, then we will set the visibility of the current window file and.

142
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.150
And we will be creating a forward password.

143
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.760
Forgot password object.

144
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.950
And we will call that for our password object as true inside the main function we have created the login

145
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.510
instance and set the visibility as to.

146
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.600
Let's see the password, cos it is defined inside the package car booking system.

147
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.430
We have imported the necessary packages.

148
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.970
This for password class extending the frame and implementing Excel listener.

149
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.110
There are one j panel of private types five text field and three.

150
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.900
Bull button types.

151
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.710
Inside the main function, we have created the forward password and set the visibility as to.

152
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.590
There is a non parameter constructor of this class.

153
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.490
We have set the bound for the frame.

154
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.590
Define the content panel and with the empty border setting that to our frame.

155
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.160
After that we have added the background color as white and set the layout as null.

156
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.660
Then there is a label, one that is a user name setting, font, family type size for it, and set its

157
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.660
bounds after that, adding that to our content bin.

158
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.660
Similarly, there is for the name setting font, family type and size for that label.

159
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.020
After that setting, bound for that label and adding that label to our content pane.

160
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.480
Similarly, we have a security question label adding a setting font, family type and size for that

161
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.990
and setting bound for that label and adding that to our content.

162
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:14.710
Similarly, there is a label for the answer and setting font family types and size for that label and

163
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.680
setting bound for it and then adding it to our content pane.

164
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.660
Similarly, there is a label for the password.

165
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.890
We are doing the same thing.

166
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.860
After that there is a text text field.

167
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:28.570
Even for the text field, when we are setting the font form color and its bound and adding that to text

168
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.460
field our content pane.

169
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.920
Similarly there is for the text to a text field.

170
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.020
T three We are doing the same thing and for the data we are setting its editable property as false.

171
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:45.130
So these are the properties we are setting for the taxpayer to do similarly for the tax will be set

172
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.160
the editable property as false, its font, its full colour column maximum size and setting its bounds

173
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.690
and adding that to our content pane.

174
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.190
Similarly, there is a default text field setting its font family type size, adding its foreground

175
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.180
colour with the help of the new colour class, setting its maximum size and setting it's bound.

176
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.610
Adding that to our content.

177
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.180
After that there is a text file.

178
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.640
They are doing the same thing for the text file.

179
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.130
Five.

180
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.190
Then we have a loaded end image with the help of image icon object.

181
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.990
Added that to our label and setting.

182
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.330
It's bound for the label and added that label to our frame.

183
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.270
After that there is a button search.

184
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.810
We are adding extra additional font type family size, setting its bound foreground and background color

185
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.310
and adding that to our content pane.

186
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.300
Similarly, there is a button two for the retrieve for which we are doing the same thing as we did for

187
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.470
the search button.

188
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.970
And there is another similar button for the back for which we are doing the similar things and setting

189
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.640
the font bound background, color and foreground color of that button.

190
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.960
Then there is a panel we have defined that is an LG panel setting bound location for it and setting

191
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.140
as background color as pink and content, adding that panel to our content panel.

192
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.410
After that, we have defined the action performed method.

193
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.920
So we inside the dialog, we have created our instance of the class.

194
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.590
And if the source of the button is from V1, then we will select the account where username will match.

195
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.430
We will create a prepared statement.

196
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.630
Set the string from one test and execute that query for that particular username required.

197
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:07.990
We will set the text in name into our text field or data and question into our text tree.

198
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:13.330
And if the source of the button is from way to what we do, we will match the select aspect for my account

199
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:13.720
answer.

200
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.640
Create a prepared statement and set the string from for get the get text.

201
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.410
After that we will execute that query.

202
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:26.370
And for that particular record where the answer will match, we will set the text, set the password,

203
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.880
password in our text.

204
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.170
55 If the source of the button is from B3, we will set the visibility of the current window as fol

205
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:37.930
and make the control of the program to our login class and set the visibility as to inside the block.

206
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.610
We will handle any exception if occurs.

207
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.320
So this is all about the three classes login sign up and forgot password class.

208
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.170
In next video we will be knowing about our home class.

209
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.210
So that's all in this video.
