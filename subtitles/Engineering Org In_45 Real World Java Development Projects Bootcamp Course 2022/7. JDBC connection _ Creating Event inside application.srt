1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,560
In previous tutorials, I told you about how we can create participants, sign up and everything.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,170
So after the admin is log in and have to write to create event number, event name with coordinator,

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,580
name, coordinator, number, fee, venue, date and etc., etc..

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,790
So you can add your own things inside this.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,910
It depends on your scenario, your creation.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,050
So for this case, you need to create one HTML file so you can create one servlet file directly.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,170
But simple case, you can create one HTML file.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,030
So as I told you, as these are the event details and everything, so.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,110
After the parties admin is login.

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:52,830
So I created one page name as admin event page basically like for creating and accepting everything

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,760
from the admin.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:06,020
So in this disease and this admin event page or event details page and inside this admin event page,

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,770
what it shows, it shows event details and transaction details.

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,270
So this is very simple.

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,860
I created with links.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,190
So for the event details, I need to create one event detail which shows the create event link and view

17
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,030
event link.

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,590
So these are again the links.

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,170
So for the creative end link, as I told you, create e dot html, i created one file.

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,230
So this is very important step here.

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,150
So for this purpose, what I created, I created a one form method.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,470
What is the form inside?

23
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,540
This is I already told you.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,980
Then I'm going to use one Soviet name as an event.

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,910
As you can see, add event here and method is boost again with event number.

26
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,740
Event name, coordinator number coordinator name everything.

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,400
Fee for registration.

28
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,990
Venue for event.

29
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,820
Date of event.

30
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,870
So I'm considering this all as a string.

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,020
Not considering anything you can consider as some date for a date field and as equal to that.

32
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,880
So for that purpose you need to change into the database connection and everything.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,850
So this is very simple case I'm choosing here.

34
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,670
So this is just creating one form method inside HTML and action is add event.

35
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,870
So for the storing purpose, what I'm going to create, I'm going to create one package or servlet inside

36
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,100
the source packages.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,470
So as I told you, what is this package, Java servlet.

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,600
So similarly like that we are going to create Java servlet.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,780
But before that I'm going to tell you some methods in servlet, servlet interfaces then basically the

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,840
DVC connection and etc..

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,720
So in this create HTML, we just created one form method with ADD event.

42
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,350
So before that, you need to create one separate table or database for an event.

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,870
Also, I'm going to further tell you about that also, but I will add some images of creation of table

44
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,370
and everything inside this.

45
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,800
So before that, let's see what is the GBC connection and etc.?

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,040
We already gone through how we can create the GC connection, but we don't know about the basic scenario.

47
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,350
So for this purpose, I'm going to tell you the basic scenario about GBC connection.

48
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,050
So as I told you, we have already gone through with gate and post method in Java solid.

49
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,600
So these are the main methods inside the Java solid.

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,120
But we can use some other servlet interfaces also like servlet interfaces.

51
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,560
What are the solid interfaces?

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,000
Basically object of servlet request is used to provide the client request information to servlet such

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,290
as content type content length, parameter names, values header information attribute means the information

54
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,540
that you type on the HTML page or HTML scenario or HTML form.

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,090
We can use servlet request for that.

56
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,870
So like there are several different methods for servlet interfaces like public string git parameter

57
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,050
is one method parameter values this one method enumeration with git parameter names method means it

58
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:25,220
will use the parameter names for that purpose, get lent, then characters encoding, etc. etc. So there

59
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,140
are too many methods already created.

60
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,700
These are the by default method.

61
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,800
So we can say default method inside this.

62
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,080
So this is all about the servlet request interfaces.

63
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,200
So what is basically request dispatcher and this method works, I will tell you later.

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,470
But before that, let's see what is GDC connection?

65
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:54,530
So in GDC Java, GBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, GDB sees Java API to connect and execute

66
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,270
query related to the database.

67
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:06,890
So GBK is a very stable API since the database and Java are deployed, gbk is very standard Java API

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,270
we are going to use here.

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,950
So for different databases like my Haskell has a different VPC, then Oracle had different DBC for the

70
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,330
deployment on the servers.

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,750
PostgreSQL is also used or different nowadays.

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,910
MongoDB is also used for that purpose, so they have some different gives connection GBK drivers we

73
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,780
can say use.

74
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,280
So what we are using all jtbc's oracle GDC API basically.

75
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,630
So inside that oracle gbk java API the statements, skills, statements and related queries already

76
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,110
written.

77
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,390
So while just we are writing this, it will also use the user connection.

78
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:53,390
So it is java is C standard edition part and gdb c API uses GDB drivers to connect the database.

79
00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:01,490
So now always remember there are four types of GBC drivers or DB bridge drivers which are basically

80
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,590
we are using the bridge connecting drivers.

81
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:10,040
So as we are using localhost, we are using this native drivers are basically specified to the specific

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
databases.

83
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:19,190
So our case is Oracle database, but it's not a native driver because these are some bridge drivers.

84
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:26,690
Native driver means if you created some dedicated database or your different database on some or storage,

85
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,040
then it's a native driver.

86
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,700
We are a network protocol driver and team driver we are going to use.

87
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:38,930
So again, there are two types like we are also using clean driver also of Oracle, not only the bridge

88
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,640
driver, we are also using the driver.

89
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:48,560
Three driver means it sets some minimum requirements and some minimalistic or simple kind of Java database

90
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,220
connection.

91
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:57,400
So we can use the Java A.C peer to access the tabular data stored in the relational databases.

92
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,880
So we are going to use relational databases.

93
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,390
Other than that, MongoDB is very advanced database, which is a new skill and everything.

94
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,640
So we are going to save update delete page data from the database through the GDB.

95
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,160
See so how the GBC works actually.

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,380
So this is GDC API.

97
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,760
This is our java application.

98
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,590
This is our end database.

99
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,970
So GBK API.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,520
So through the Java application we are accessing both database driver for the database and GBK API.

101
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,580
So this is very simple.

102
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,050
So far, the GDP of Oracle database.

103
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:36,040
I already told you we have to create one driver class first or to access everything here.

104
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,800
Then we have to the Excel.

105
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,910
Always remember that is Oracle GDP driver, not Oracle driver.

106
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,190
Then our connection.

107
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,280
You are in connection URL for the Oracle thingy database.

108
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,620
You have to use this thing localhost with that portal port number.

109
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,590
Now remember, this port number is always the always XY Oracle service name and everything.

110
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,640
So you can check for that information.

111
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,290
DNS names.

112
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,280
Alright, that's a file inside the database file.

113
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,650
You can always, always find these information if your port is different for the local list.

114
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,730
User name for is very important.

115
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,670
Default is system.

116
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,890
I'm going to use your default username.

117
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,300
You can create your own user.

118
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,740
You can use the password also.

119
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,400
Before that, I already told you how you can change that sort of database.

120
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,820
We have to execute this thing for the changing the code.

121
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:39,080
But always remember, if you change the port, you have to see these file DNS names or a file inside

122
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,000
this to check your port number to change the connection you are also.

123
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,220
Other than that, you can change the classes forward.

124
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:52,880
So for this project I saw the error that are mostly the class.

125
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,220
Three servers cannot be deployed because it's using same port as Oracle.

126
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,170
It's also using 88 port and G+, which is also using 88 port.

127
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,420
You have to change the either port, like for the Oracle database or for the Class V server.

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,890
So the port changing the free server is very easy.

129
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,690
Just go to that config file and change it.

130
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,100
I already told you in the previous some lectures that how you can change this port to another port.

131
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,320
So I am going to use 2002 port in the last V server.

132
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,550
But before this, if you don't want to change that port, you can change this port.

133
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,140
Also using this query, execute the VMs and this is SDB.

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,840
This is please query basically to 2002.

135
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,190
You have to change this port.

136
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,800
But again, remember you have to change this into the connection you are also.

137
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,490
So before that you should know how we can create table and how you are inserting data, how you are

138
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,250
paging basic SQL basics things here.

139
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:04,700
So this is all about the ABC, so let us move how we can create the form method or how we can execute

140
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,660
this form method.

141
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,420
So let us see how we can see this.

142
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:16,220
So we already created this part for the for method using create event HTML and we are going to add event

143
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,330
in the HTML page.

144
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,850
Or on from the steam page to the database.

145
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,850
So simple method I'm going to use first.

146
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,450
Invoke all the libraries first, which is basically import import Java audio and all Java school and

147
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,530
servlet libraries.

148
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:40,660
Then public class advantage, HTTP servlet, which extends to that ADD event.

149
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,980
So this is called, as you can say, we are extended to the HTML.

150
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
So let's.

151
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,470
Class or default method or default class.

152
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,950
So I'm going to use your again public word dupes you can either use do it also here, but I'm using

153
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:05,570
too many things or I'm going to say too many things and do get method will restrict me for some time

154
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,620
or of some cases.

155
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,840
So I'm going to use Duplass method.

156
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,460
Always remember you have to create some table request and then HTTP response.

157
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,120
So late response which throws or solid exception.

158
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,280
So you have to handle the exceptions also here.

159
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,110
Then you have to create a response at content, time, text or email.

160
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,180
I told you the significance of this.

161
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,550
I am again telling you while you are writing some HTML tags inside Java.

162
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,460
So what it will do I want if the event is added, I want to show the event added theme or event added

163
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,990
length of all things.

164
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,430
So what you are going to do?

165
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,330
I'm going to invoke some tags here, like h two, h three inside the HTML.

166
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,350
But while using these tags it will show me the error like element or like inside that it will show for

167
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,550
the full tag, not the error, but it's a visual bug we can see.

168
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,450
So for that purpose, set content type is text or HTML.

169
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,350
So Java will take care that this is the HTML tag.

170
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,740
So we present on that HTML as HTML page.

171
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,600
Or if it's a text show, it says it takes page.

172
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,150
So print that for the response.

173
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,980
Get writer.

174
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:22,530
So for this purpose now I'm going to fetching the data from the HTML page.

175
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,120
Pitching data from HTML form.

176
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,820
Again, I'm telling always remember these names and these names should be always same.

177
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,320
These are all things.

178
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,640
Connection with database.

179
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:45,230
Again, we already have seen for the login why we have to use the track because.

180
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,300
It.

181
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,040
It makes you the some escalator.

182
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,390
So we have to handle that.

183
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,180
So you can either specify this inside.

184
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,000
Like this also throws exception, stability exception, glaucoma school exception.

185
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,460
But I don't want to explain everything.

186
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,700
So this is using close.

187
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,660
It will not show me the proper error.

188
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,870
So for showing the proper error and for the proper event, the error handling or exception handling,

189
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,630
I'm going to use your trick educator.

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,030
So class not for name reading class then connection URL string name username then connection driver

191
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:31,620
manager to establish the connection I will again come in this part also establish connection.

192
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:43,890
You can either put some out dot print statement also here that is System.out.println and that connection

193
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,330
is successful and everything.

194
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:51,890
But you have to check, always check the command prompt inside your ID or your executing part.

195
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,900
So I don't want to check everything again and again.

196
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,450
So statement I'm going to create one statement.

197
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,070
So to insert these into the event database.

198
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,550
That I have already created inside this.

199
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,950
To insert this into the event database, what I'm going to do, I'm going to execute very insert into

200
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,930
event what is the values.

201
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,690
So I'm going to insert these values.

202
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:22,650
So I'm putting a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven to the this and I'm going to insert inside

203
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:30,690
this similarly, like we are going to insert in our login page or sign up page or the participants similarly

204
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:38,160
like that, I'm going to use this 1a2838485 and 867.

205
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:45,540
I'm going to put always remember close this with semicolon then resource statement, query and all the

206
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,090
things include the database.

207
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:54,840
I'm going to include this event edit statement and it should remain on the same page then system of

208
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:03,180
println to print this to the command prompt that added to the database, committing that because it

209
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,880
will end that part there.

210
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,490
So it will not show any anomaly there and contact clause for closing the connection.

211
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,650
So that's it about how we can create this.

212
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,300
In further case, I'm going to tell you how we can create transaction history and everything, but also

213
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,520
what is the difference between include and forward?

214
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,820
So let us see how we can create that part also.
