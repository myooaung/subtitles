1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,700
So here we have a stretch of the wall text reel and this all in the previous video.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,310
We have seen it and done this thing.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,560
So now what we will do, which we have created here, we have to build the UI part also.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,670
So what we will do, we will create the image class.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,950
So here what will do?

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,860
Image button, create a class by the name image button.

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,230
And here I have created this class.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,550
Now we have to do first thing.

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,950
Firstly, image button.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,990
Inherit the class.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:48,340
No, inherit the interface by button, which we have used in the earlier class.

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,320
So it will import this.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,030
And now what we will do.

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:58,330
We have to create the private string.

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,530
Niemeyer.

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,450
Does the style normal?

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:04,640
Okay.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,800
So here I will do one thing and right style.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,810
Normal and set.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,900
It's the value here.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,610
The fix a new style background.

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,890
We will write the background color here and set this thing to transparent.

23
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:40,540
It's done and afterwards we need the padding part also so right the padding attribute and set its value

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,280
to comma two, comma to, comma to and extra.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,480
And after that, we need another thing.

26
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,230
So it has to be the uppercase string we need.

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:00,060
Same thing, but we will need what we are doing.

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,790
Firstly.

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,300
Okay.

30
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,530
Just write me.

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,690
Let me write.

32
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,330
We will give it to the press.

33
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,920
So what we are doing the buttons which we have created, the bag, the forward and the reload button

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,670
here.

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,710
I have given this the style normal run.

36
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:26,050
It's showing something the button it's created in the rectangular form and then it's showing the normal

37
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,500
form.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,710
We have seen it in the right form or something, but when we press that button, it will react with

39
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,870
the UI part.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:41,560
So here which we are, what we are doing, then it's a normal, we have set its colour to the transparent

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,940
and it is operating now here we will do another thing.

42
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:54,130
Then we will press when the user presses that button here, something which will give it the effect.

43
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,460
So here we will write the effects by background colour.

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,800
This thing inside it's the value to the transparent of force transparent.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,780
And afterwards we need another thing that is the padding part.

46
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:23,110
So padding and sets this value 3113 so it's done this done.

47
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,060
This is also done.

48
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:33,490
So now another thing which we will create our image button costs by image button method.

49
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:47,950
So here what we'll do, we will take it as the each button method and give it the parameter as the image

50
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,140
and orange.

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,840
No.

52
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,150
Amy Grant here.

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,680
Another thing which we need the high end of.

54
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,030
So we will set it to a double edge and double W.

55
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,950
No, we will give it some body, of course.

56
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,620
So here I will do the image.

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:21,610
You set the new image equal the new image view and give the parameter to the original image.

58
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:22,900
Okay.

59
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,250
So.

60
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,960
We have to import this also.

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,520
So we importing this import image to the beauty.

62
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,440
Okay.

63
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,470
Something I will do one thing.

64
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,640
That image.

65
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,790
This one even imported from the Java text or seen image.

66
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,570
Not that part.

67
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,220
And here it's done.

68
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,260
So put the semicolon and afterwards we will give it the height and the width.

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:24,720
So we may not set foot height to the achievable image dot set foot width to the W variable which we

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,940
have initialized.

71
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,630
And then use the set preservation.

72
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,700
We need the preservation tool.

73
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:43,590
So the preserve ratio set it to the true and afterwards we need the graphic, but also the set graphic.

74
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:45,780
Okay.

75
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,880
Give it some better meter to image and lantern.

76
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,730
And afterwards we will.

77
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:59,150
Set the style and give it the parameter style.

78
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,810
Normally.

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,660
So this thing.

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,370
The style normal.

81
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,290
Okay.

82
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,400
We have.

83
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,440
Make it to the case.

84
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:17,350
I have done it in the lower case and it's done so here.

85
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:27,100
We have to give the action here and also so we will call certain mouse pressed, the user will interact

86
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,830
with the mouse pressed, even not clicked.

87
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:44,290
So we need the mouse pressed event here, this event handler and set to the event Arrow, said Stein.

88
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,120
What does this do?

89
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,510
This one and that spring which.

90
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,370
But we need the press.

91
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,700
Well, not the normal.

92
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:08,480
This one, I will write the blessed value and simply copy this again and the user remove the pressed,

93
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,730
remove its finger.

94
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,100
It will set it to the normal value here, to normal thing here.

95
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,710
We have done this thing and you're ready.

96
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,500
Your interaction is done.

97
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,970
But another thing which we need is to see us as part two.

98
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:37,190
So what we need, what we have to do, we will create another C file in this folder, this RC mean this

99
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:49,350
the resources will go into that and create a new file name as the style c is silent.

100
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,670
S In this thing what we will do.

101
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,400
We have the bar and the scrollbar.

102
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,440
We have to give it the style also.

103
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,710
So here I am using this thing and what we will do.

104
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:14,210
We have to simply write our thesis part so we will write C assist or not bar and give it the thing to

105
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:25,610
the effects background thing by chrome insets and set it to the one, 1 to 1 here.

106
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,880
And another thing which we need is the padding part.

107
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,980
So here the padding and done and set it to the point to zero.

108
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,020
It will be enough.

109
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,990
And afterwards we have to give the style to our body thing also.

110
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:49,880
So here I'm using the body part and I use it to the X and the Y with the height and width part.

111
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:57,080
So overflow the blue and sorry the x one so related to the hidden thing.

112
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,830
And afterwards you need the writing also.

113
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,110
So set it to hidden also.

114
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,080
Here.

115
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,500
It is done.

116
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,180
Okay.

117
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,170
No space.

118
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,890
Sorry.

119
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,930
So everybody is done.

120
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,210
And the thing which we need, the scrollbar, which we will see it as the right colour.

121
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,550
So we have to give it colour also.

122
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:36,240
So we will write the scroll bar and get the parenthesis and set its word first.

123
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:48,470
We will take it as a 16 x and it will be show the string on another thing which we need to get.

124
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,180
Get on.

125
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,770
We will set the colour of the school scroll by track.

126
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,990
So here we set it to the background colour.

127
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,000
Background color to white this one.

128
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,600
So we have done our part parting.

129
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,700
Now what we will next thing we will do, we have to complete our browser class.

130
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,890
So it will be our last step.

131
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,680
And here we will do our last step.

132
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,720
Is the browser class created.
