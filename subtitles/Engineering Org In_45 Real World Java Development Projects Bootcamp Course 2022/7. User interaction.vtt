1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.510
So now we will create a third mouse breast which will react to mouse click through here.

2
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:18.580
After this, we will write private class mice adapter.

3
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.840
Okay.

4
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.200
Mine's adaptor, which extends to the mouse adapter

5
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.970
here and.

6
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.390
No.

7
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.680
From.

8
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.100
For that.

9
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.610
What we can do.

10
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.430
We can do one thing.

11
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.680
What should we do?

12
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:21.400
Key word, the initial word here and here, we can add the most listener.

13
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.560
Mouse listener.

14
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.800
I notice we can write new minds.

15
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.480
After.

16
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.180
No.

17
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.550
Okay.

18
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.880
Here.

19
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:18.360
We have created our class minds and are already so full that we can do one thing.

20
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:36.890
Here we will write we will speak of variable for the index is equal to e not get y coordinate no x coordinate.

21
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.720
And after that we will need in the y variable which will be the local variable and it will set it to

22
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:54.260
get the y coordinate and here will determine the x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer which will

23
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.160
react to the left and the right mouse clicks on the user.

24
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.120
So after that we compute the corresponding column and draw the minefield.

25
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:17.510
So here we will take in the C column which will write X divided by cell sites.

26
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:28.250
And then Harry will take the C row and set it to the one divided by seven size.

27
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.950
This will conclude the corresponding column and remove the minefield.

28
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.880
So here we have the method which react to the mouse clicks.

29
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.090
The minesweeper game is controlled solely by the mouse and we react to left and right.

30
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.420
Mouse clicks on the user and we have determined the x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer.

31
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:05.990
And here we have take the here we already take the corresponding column and draw of the minefield.

32
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:20.840
So now what we can do here, we will take a boolean variable by the name to repaint the blue repaint

33
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.780
controls default.

34
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.640
Set it to the false.

35
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.680
Do you think?

36
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.040
Now we will take a condition.

37
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.700
If.

38
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.090
In 19.

39
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:52.350
So here we will call our methods new game and another one which will be free paid.

40
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.320
Repeat here.

41
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.650
So after this, also, we have to create this method.

42
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.170
Okay.

43
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.420
So here then.

44
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.750
Now we need to check with the other condition.

45
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.150
So we check that we are located in the area of the minefield or not.

46
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.000
So we will take a condition here.

47
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.930
We will write if feel.

48
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.350
I regret the value in the parenthesis.

49
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.550
See Roo.

50
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.830
It should be multi.

51
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.320
No.

52
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.320
Yeah.

53
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.910
It should be multiplied with the number of columns.

54
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.680
Know what we can do.

55
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.640
You know what we have take over part.

56
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.050
Okay.

57
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.540
So here what we have to take.

58
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.830
Here we will write a note.

59
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:24.420
Here we will take the values if the parentheses X is less than the number of columns.

60
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.070
And.

61
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.490
Okay.

62
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.270
Okay.

63
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.020
So what we will do here?

64
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.850
I will write a number of columns.

65
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.580
Is multiplied with the cell size.

66
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.080
And signs.

67
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.710
And we will take

68
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.730
this lesson.

69
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:29.950
And total rules should be multiplied by the cell size.

70
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:37.840
So here what we will write under this if condition, we will write.

71
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.570
If you don't get better.

72
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:56.270
None is equal to the mouse event, not Bolton three.

73
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.300
Here, we will try it.

74
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.600
We will take another condition.

75
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.550
Here we are, checking that we are located in the area of the minefield or not.

76
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.010
So the uncovering of the mines is done with the right mouse button.

77
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.120
So we have to clear the button.

78
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.480
Three.

79
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:25.960
Now we will check with a condition which will check that we are located an area on the field minefield

80
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.580
or not.

81
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:36.190
So here I will write if field and notice we will take see row.

82
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.290
This multiplied.

83
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.130
No more.

84
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.620
Okay, so we need a number of columns here.

85
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.560
Not that I want to see all.

86
00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.360
Literally less than an equal to.

87
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:02.940
No.

88
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:09.300
I think here we need the field C to multiply with the columns.

89
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:20.940
And second it will check here if it is greater than the mine cell or not.

90
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.580
So here we will write

91
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.690
to repeat.

92
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.400
Do reprint boolean which will set it to not true here.

93
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:40.610
Okay.

94
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.640
So now what we will take we take another condition here.

95
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:47.740
No.

96
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.090
Will take this condition.

97
00:09:51.450 --> 00:10:04.970
Under this condition, we will right field which will have to see through and multiplied with the end

98
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.970
calls.

99
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:16.470
We need to end calls here and see if they feel okay.

100
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.410
This will be under the parentheses.

101
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:28.930
You're done and calls which really add up with the C column.

102
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:37.510
And here it will check if it is less than or equal to the word mindset.

103
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:49.900
And then here what we will take if minus left readable is greater than zero.

104
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:55.090
So we will write field.

105
00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:08.470
Under this we will be C2 is multiplied with the end columns and it will end up with the C column.

106
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.970
Here it goes.

107
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:20.610
Plus equal to the mark of the cell, mark for cell here.

108
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.080
And then we will decrement the minus left variable.

109
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.620
And then and now we need a string message to store.

110
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.710
So had I been indigent or to string.

111
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:43.770
Here are the two string and give the parameter to the mine's left.

112
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.780
That's one and done.

113
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:55.720
Now we need to set the status for label with the set text message.

114
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.250
So here I will give the parameter to the message.

115
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:09.030
And then here, take the health condition and then.

116
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.510
Right.

117
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.400
Status here.

118
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.770
Don't sit next here.

119
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.840
I will send that text to the no marks.

120
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.520
Never.

121
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.660
No, no.

122
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.420
After that, we have to go with the other condition.

123
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.130
Here, I will take the health condition and try it.

124
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:52.940
I feel literally the sero here literally multiplied the number of columns.

125
00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:00.940
And don't forget, we call it dual.

126
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.650
Minus equal the mark for cell.

127
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.540
And now the minus left variable.

128
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.680
Decrement.

129
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.790
No, it should be increment here.

130
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.020
Reality check with the decrement already.

131
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:38.200
So here we will take a string message is equal to integer, not to string and here I will try to mine

132
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.140
take the mine left and done.

133
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.650
And after that we need the status bar.

134
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:54.010
Note that text here.

135
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.620
I will give the parameter to the message.

136
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.650
Now go with the last condition here.

137
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:09.070
And we will take the condition with if.

138
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.060
So we will take it.

139
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.220
And here I will write.

140
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.940
See under this, I will take zero.

141
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.560
See you to a truly multiplying calls.

142
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:44.490
I know it the second it should be greater than all default code mindset.

143
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:51.080
Which you'll see right now.

144
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:59.110
After that, we need another condition which will check feel.

145
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.070
The through.

146
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:21.130
Read this, you will write the rule which should be multiplied with the end columns, and here I end

147
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:26.550
up with the C column, of course, here and done.

148
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.570
And it should be greater than mine.

149
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.880
Okay, so this is done.

150
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.280
No.

151
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.140
Next.

152
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.360
Another condition?

153
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.590
It should be.

154
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.640
And.

155
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.010
We will check with the field.

156
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:54.830
And then this we can write c row multiplied with the N columns.

157
00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:07.450
And it should be in the second and then it should be less then with the mob mindset.

158
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:21.820
And then no, in this F condition we will right field and need the zero here and it should be multiplied

159
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.520
with the total number of columns here.

160
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.670
And it will be afterwards ahead of the.

161
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:39.470
C colon variable, it will be the minus on equal to low cover for cell.

162
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.560
And then no.

163
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.890
We take the do repaint variable here and set it to true here.

164
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:55.550
Now we need another f condition under this.

165
00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:07.550
So we will write if field with the c row and it will be multiplied with the columns.

166
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:18.900
Then afterwards I dealt with the C column, which really equal to the mindset.

167
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.220
Here.

168
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:27.390
What we will do, we will set the in-game variable with the falls

169
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.440
on this one.

170
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:38.160
Now, after that, the last if condition will be the field.

171
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.380
And under that, we need to see.

172
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.910
It should be multiplied with in columns.

173
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.210
Okay.

174
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.790
It should be in the parentheses.

175
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.880
It will afterwards end up with the sequel

176
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.120
and it will check it with the empty scene.

177
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.560
And if it is empty, then what we will do?

178
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:17.130
We need to find empty cells, methods, method, and under that we will give the param meter to the

179
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:23.610
C2 multiplied to the MN columns.

180
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:33.970
And here what we will do will need to know the column here.

181
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.870
After that we need if.

182
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:41.610
Okay.

183
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.510
So firstly explain I will explain this thing.

184
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:56.220
What we have done here, we have determined the x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer and after that

185
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.780
we compute the corresponding column and row of the minefield.

186
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.960
So we check the we will check that we are located in the area of the minefield or not.

187
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.020
I'm checking that part.

188
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.950
And uncovering of the mines is done with the right mouse button.

189
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.240
The button tree.

190
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:22.980
So if we right click on an unmarked cell, we add mark four cell to the number representing the cell.

191
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:28.590
This leads to drawing a covered cell with a mark in the paint component method.

192
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:37.350
So if left click on a cell that has been already moved, we remove the mark and increase the number

193
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.170
of cells to be moved.

194
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.970
Okay, so here I have done this thing or every left.

195
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:50.610
So if nothing happens, if we click on the cover in the map, it must be.

196
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:58.050
It must first uncovered by another right click, and only then it is possible to let click on it.

197
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:05.930
So yeah, this one, the cover for a left click removes a cover from the cell.

198
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:12.350
So in case if we left, in case we left, clicked on a mine.

199
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.640
The game is over.

200
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.950
If we left, click on an empty cell.

201
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:22.820
We call the find empty cell method, which recursively finds all adjacent empty cells.

202
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.720
So we need the boards need to be repainted, for instance, a marker set removed.

203
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.350
So here I will call the repaint method.

204
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.920
Here I will write do repaint.

205
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:43.480
And under this I will try it repaint and.

206
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.590
Here.

207
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.880
Yes, I have.

208
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.990
Yeah.

209
00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.810
Repaint.

210
00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:11.270
We will see that part in other class here.

211
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:12.990
Okay.

212
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.410
So here we have done.

213
00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:22.730
If the board needs to be repainted, for instance, a marker set or removed, we will call the repaint

214
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.390
matter and it will retained our board.

215
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.010
So this.
