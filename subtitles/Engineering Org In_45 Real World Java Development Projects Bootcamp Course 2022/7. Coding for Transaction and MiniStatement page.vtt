00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.220
So in this video we will talk about the two classes, which is transaction on Java and many statements

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.270
on Java files.

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.310
So a transaction or Java page will appear after the successful login of the accounts.

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.310
So this.

5
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.760
Class is defined inside the package bank.

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.250
We have imported the necessary packages like Java Auditability, which will help us to create graphical

7
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.160
user interface.

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.130
Java JWT taught event which is help us to handle events over the buttons.

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.750
And Java starts when.

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.220
Which will be our vehicle, which is a basically a modified version of a package, and the giant scale

11
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.030
will help us to interact with our database now that we have defined the public class transaction, which

12
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.320
is extending frame.

13
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.500
And implementing or class interface.

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.930
After that we have defined that there is a label, one and seven buttons will be there and there is

15
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.280
a certain type of variable pin.

16
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.530
Now we have defined the parameterized constructor of the class by passing a string type of variable

17
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.190
pin and set the current current instance of pin variable to the past.

18
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.230
A string pin then.

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.410
We have defined the image icon object by with the help of class or get system resource by passing the

20
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.600
image or location of the image.

21
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.630
And after that we have scaled the position and instance size of that image.

22
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.650
In the image I image object A2.

23
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.450
After that we have passed that image object to the image icon three and then we have passed that image

24
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.350
icon object in our label, L2.

25
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.160
After that, what we did is set the location and size for the L2 to the location will be zero, comma

26
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.030
zero and its size is nine six to cross 1080.

27
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.970
And after that we have added that label to our frame.

28
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.640
The next level.

29
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.980
Here is one which is a new J label.

30
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.740
Please select your transaction so it will be showing.

31
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.990
Please select your transaction after that.

32
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.390
We have set the foreground color of that label as white, colored or white.

33
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.180
So after that we have set the font for that label that is a new font.

34
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.380
It's family system, its type is bold and its size will be 16.

35
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.440
Then there are six patterns we have defined.

36
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.420
First button is labelled as deposit.

37
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.490
Second button is as gas withdrawal.

38
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.140
Third button is as fast as fourth button is as many statement.

39
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.790
Fifth button is as pin change and the sixth button is at balance inquiry.

40
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.970
Seventh button is as exit.

41
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.890
So these will be the options inside our transaction interface or window.

42
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.180
After that, we have set the layout of the complete window as null.

43
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.550
And then we have set the.

44
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.620
Location and size for those labels.

45
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.780
So one will be having a location at 235, comma 400 and its size will be seven in Red Cross 35.

46
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.940
And then we have added that 11 to our two.

47
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.510
After that, we have set the location and size for the button one.

48
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.710
Its size is 150 to 35 and its location is 170, comma 499.

49
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.930
After that, we have added that button to our end two.

50
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.580
Similarly, for the button two, we have set it its location and its size.

51
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.460
The location is 390 for 99 and its size is 150 cross 35.

52
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.130
Similarly adding that button to also our label.

53
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.950
After that we have defined the set down for our button three.

54
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.610
Its size is 150 to 35 and its location will be 170, comma 543.

55
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.830
And adding that button to our label too.

56
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.880
After that in the there is a button for setting.

57
00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.260
Bound for that button for each location is 390 comma 543 and its size will be 150 plus 35.

58
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.920
And adding that button for to our label to after that we have defined the button five location of it

59
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.230
17588 and its size will be 150 parameter across 35.

60
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.110
Then we have added that button to also our label.

61
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:24.380
Similarly for the button six, we have defined its location as three 9588 and after that we have its

62
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.080
size as 150 plus 35, adding that two also over label two then for the last button seven we have its

63
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.600
location is 390 comma 633 and its size as 150 plus 35 adding that also to our button, that button to

64
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.490
our label Delta.

65
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.220
Similarly, we have added Excel is not over all the buttons.

66
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:53.590
Then we have set the size of the complete frame as 960 1080 and its location is 500 comma zero and the

67
00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.340
property of the frame as true and the visibility as true what we are doing after this we have defined

68
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.780
the action, perform the event.

69
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.940
So inside the action performance method, it is taking action event object as argument.

70
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.600
So if the source of the event is from one, what we will do.

71
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.580
We will set the current visibility of the window as false, and we will call the deposit clause new

72
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.560
deposit by passing that pin.

73
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.530
And so the visibility as to now if the source of the button is from B2, we will again close this current

74
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.210
window and call the withdrawal class by passing that pin and set the visibility as true.

75
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:37.560
Similarly, for the button three, we will close the current window and we will call the fast gas by

76
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.760
passing bin to that class and set the visibility as true.

77
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.520
If the source of the baton is from before, then we will call them in statement class by passing payments

78
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.330
and the possibility as to if the source of the baton is from five.

79
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.700
Then we will set the visibility of the current window as false and calling the PIN method by passing

80
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.500
the PIN and set the visibility as true.

81
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.330
And after that, if the source of the baton is from B six, we will set the visibility as false and

82
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.910
we will call balance enquiry, pin balance enquiry, passing the PIN as an argument and setting the

83
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:17.660
visibility as to now elseif, if the source of the pattern is from BB7, we will be closing the complete

84
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.320
programme.

85
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.860
Inside the main method we have called the new transaction with the null values and set the possibility

86
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.400
as to.

87
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.300
Now let's have a look at another class that is a mini statement on Java file.

88
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:35.540
So inside the package bank, what we have did is we have defined import Java, JWT, which will help

89
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.410
us to create graphical user interface Java event which will help us to handle events over the button's

90
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.760
swing dot aspect and Java dot scale to interact with our database.

91
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.850
After after that, what we did is we have.

92
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.980
A stored initial is initialized and defined our class many statement which is extending the frame and

93
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.480
implementing accent listener.

94
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.370
And there are two buttons, B1 and B2 and there is a label L1.

95
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.690
So after that we have defined.

96
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.160
Parameterized.

97
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.350
After that, we have defined the parameterized.

98
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:21.250
Constructed here is string passing that string pin and we have headed it as many statement.

99
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:27.190
After that we will be getting content paint and set background color as white for the complete window.

100
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:34.120
Then we set the size as 400, comma 600, and after that set location as 20, comma, 20.

101
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.570
Now one new label will be defined and add 11.

102
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.970
Adding 11 to a word frame.

103
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.080
After that there is a label two as Indian bank and set the bound for that label as 150, comma 20 and

104
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.190
size as 100 cross 20 and adding that L2 to our frame.

105
00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:00.380
Similarly, there is a label L three which is which does not contain any value and its location is 28

106
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.700
and its size is 300 comma 300 cross 20.

107
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.010
Adding that label to our frame.

108
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.680
After that there is a label for which will also not contain any values.

109
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:14.430
Its location is 20 comma 400 intended size trend across 40, adding that to our frame.

110
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.020
Inside the block.

111
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.350
We have initialized the connection and created a connection with the help of our connection class.

112
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:29.490
And now for inside the results set instance, we have executed the query select aspect from log in where

113
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.760
PIN will match.

114
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.960
So from the login table we will fetch the record and where the pin will match.

115
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.680
And while our start next for that record of that particular pin, what we are doing is we adding in

116
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.780
label three set text card number.

117
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:50.380
We will be adding card number in label three and substring zero comma four.

118
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.630
So we will be getting last starting four digits of that card.

119
00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:05.020
Then we will add these x x x in the middle and after that we will be fetching the last four digits substring

120
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.310
from 12 to last.

121
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.800
So this is how the card number will be displayed.

122
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.550
Guys BLOCK will handle an exception if occurs.

123
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.830
Similarly, for the right block, we have balances equals to zero.

124
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.490
Initialize the connection with the database and with the help of results.

125
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.350
At instance, what we are doing is executing the query that is select as from bank where pin number

126
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.770
match.

127
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:31.520
So from from the bank table, we will be fetching the record for that particular pin and over that record

128
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.820
we will be trading by loop and L1 dot set text.

129
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.150
So inside the L1, what we will do is L1 get text.

130
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:44.900
So we will be getting text from the L1 and add it to with that is estimated tag and asked string from

131
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.380
date.

132
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.100
So from the date method, we will get the date of that transaction.

133
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.520
This is for the space as we have created here an HTML tag.

134
00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:03.290
And after that there is a get a string mode that will get a string from the mode and these will be the

135
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.100
spaces.

136
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.090
After that there is an amount and then we have defined BBR.

137
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.590
So that will be breaking up the two lines break and then we have closed the HTML tag.

138
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.570
After that there is if I don't get a string mode equals to this bar deposit.

139
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:24.240
So if the mode is of deposit, so we will be printing amount by adding in the balance.

140
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:31.230
And if the mode is from withdrawal, then we will be subtracting the amount and storing it in the balance.

141
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.350
So for that set, text your total balances balance.

142
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:39.450
So we will then add text through our label for with this statement.

143
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:45.570
After that, cash block will handle any exception if occurs and set the layout of the complete window

144
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.200
as null and after that there is a button exit.

145
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.900
So adding that button to our frame, adding action listener to it, and setting the bound for the L1

146
00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:01.200
which is 20 comma, 140 position and 400 plus 200 its size, then setting the bound for that button

147
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.490
which is exit 20, comma 500.

148
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:13.180
Location in Red Cross 25 its size then inside the action perform element for the exit button, we will

149
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.870
just simply set the visibility of the current window as false.

150
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.610
And inside the static Weidman method, we will be calling mini statement with the null argument and

151
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.900
setting the visibility as to.

152
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.970
So these are the two classes named as transaction or Java and meaning statement on Java.

153
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.530
So this is all about in this.
