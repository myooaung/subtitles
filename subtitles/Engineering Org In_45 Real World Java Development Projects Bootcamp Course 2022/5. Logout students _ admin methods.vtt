00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:09.730
In previous videos or tutorials, I told you I have created one studio method for connection to the

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.470
database.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.130
Insert student is one method, then all records get all records.

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.080
Using array is another method.

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.330
Then I'm using delete record method.

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.880
Also get student name method also.

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.110
So these are some common things I used with update and record also.

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.210
So this is student studio.

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.470
Similarly, we created a window which is very less actually because I'm just fetching from the database

10
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.530
and putting because admin has a poor role to use all the student EU and all the methods.

11
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.700
Similarly, we have to create methods for questions and insert also.

12
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.000
So finally, we need to create these methods.

13
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.020
So if you predefined some questions, this is not very useful because you need to again and again use

14
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.270
database queries, no database part.

15
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.310
So if you want to use interface, you need to create one method also.

16
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.880
So I created question the method.

17
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.140
Then this is instruction.

18
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.410
Insert question method I'm using here.

19
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.240
So this is what it will be do.

20
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.890
It will fetch the data.

21
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.590
I'm not providing here.

22
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.340
It's fetching data because I need to create another file also.

23
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.360
So in further part I will told you how you can create JS file here.

24
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.990
And we are going to create JSP file in web pages but also.

25
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.670
So this will execute this and it will update that with your question table.

26
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.360
So I will show you which queries you want to do because we need to just create tables here.

27
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.880
No need to create all things or insert the data we need to create around.

28
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.580
Or we want we need to execute only 5 to 6 queries inside the database only to create database.

29
00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.350
So question zero four to get all records of the questions and then delete record to delete the question

30
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.990
and update to update that question part and everything.

31
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.450
So you can update question table using with like you can put new question or you can change that question.

32
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.830
You can change the option.

33
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.050
And there is one another for original question because you need to see that original question also.

34
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.720
So this is all about the question you, which is very simple method and which is very helpful or no.

35
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.370
One question to you, which is very simple, like the logic is simple.

36
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.240
As we are going with studio, we need to get to random.

37
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.540
Similarly for the great questions and everything, I'm using this.

38
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.670
If you know the solid part, you can easily create that part.

39
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.500
I will explain you step by step here.

40
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.860
So for the insert question, I'm using boolean method.

41
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.360
So I am using boolean.

42
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.350
So once it is done it will show that boolean part only.

43
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:07.240
If true, then I can use that logic and I'm switching the exception everything for the ArrayList.

44
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.260
I'm using ArrayList as a question and select from the question list.

45
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.850
It will print all the ArrayList.

46
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.440
So this is the back end part.

47
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.090
I will connect this back end to the front end to show in some beautiful manner inside our JSP file our

48
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.720
web page.

49
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.100
Again delete record.

50
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.760
I don't want to create some HTML and java file for that.

51
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.140
I will embedded the Java code inside html.

52
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.040
So I am using JSP here, so it will be very helpful.

53
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.200
While creating JSP, you will see how we are going with this part.

54
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.870
So once I released for the record same query delete from question table where question is.

55
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.500
So that star will be from that.

56
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.100
Great question.

57
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.930
And what is your.

58
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.310
Q Good question.

59
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.930
Questions where is the question part?

60
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.290
So question is basically Oracle, which we created on our already good question and all that things

61
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.710
it will you ask a question and it will delete that part and.

62
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.060
That's it.

63
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.860
We are doing our part.

64
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.290
I again handling the exception.

65
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.460
Handling the exception is very important part here.

66
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.650
Always handle that.

67
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:29.390
Then with original question, new question and with all the options and answers, you have to update

68
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.780
that record and to the new record.

69
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.630
So this is all about how you can create question part.

70
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.930
You can question the method.

71
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.790
Similarly, what I'm going to do, I'm going to do I'm going to create instruction due to insert instructions

72
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.040
and some of getting all records, delete records and update record.

73
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.550
So as we are creating for studio, I'm going with same logic, same methods here.

74
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.850
So get connection, insert connection which contains insert connection with the instruction ISD.

75
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.770
Then what is this instruction?

76
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.540
I see where I'm getting this instruction, which is basically all USB instructions.

77
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.940
I told you in further part how in previous part how we already created this.

78
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.420
You can use your starter method for school and all these things, but I'm showing which libraries I'm

79
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.140
using only connection, prepared statement and results that I'm using here.

80
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.180
Not all of files I'm using.

81
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.990
So this will insert all the values inside the database, then add a list and get all records.

82
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.290
It will getting all the codes from this.

83
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.440
So remember, this is very important these things.

84
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:53.330
Then similarly for a delete instruction table where instruction and this also queries are same simple

85
00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.130
but all I'm changing just to database and all things are simple and similar to once I you have created

86
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.010
students view all things are similar.

87
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.680
This is all about how we can create all things.

88
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.350
So this is all about we now.

89
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.130
We are done.

90
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.740
We are done with OSD.

91
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.830
We part because we already know that and us dot model.

92
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.830
So not only are we finished here only, but we need to create some controlling part with constraints.

93
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.960
Log out instruction, insert method also.

94
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:34.190
Also we need to create one another things in JSP because we just we are just doing this back end.

95
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.020
We need to create frontend also.

96
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.850
So we will see in this video only how we can go with that part.

97
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.650
So let us see how we can create in that we use controller instruction, insert part.

98
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.770
So instruction insert.

99
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.920
Let me close this part.

100
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.000
So what will this method do?

101
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:06.500
What it will insert that method with to all things and which is basically a very simple method for the

102
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.700
status and everything.

103
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.890
I'm using this.

104
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:16.220
So I need, we need to use this method instruction because if you are inserting the instruction, you

105
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.080
need to create some Java file.

106
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.630
We are already created when the instruction insert or instruction duo part which is using simple thing

107
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:32.090
that audio as you can see this part but we need to push some message that database is updated or we

108
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.180
can say instruction is inserted for that purpose.

109
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.230
I'm using this.

110
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:42.770
So controller is basically you can see upper level Java servlet which displays only the messages to

111
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.790
the user.

112
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:54.050
Then DB is for the creating some methods which is helpful to create some database, then updating that

113
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:59.630
table method, updating the method or inserting some database inside that.

114
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:05.900
So it will the second layer servlet classes or you can say second level important classes remember or

115
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:11.090
use dot model is very important because I am creating all the methods with the instructions and everything.

116
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.090
So it will.

117
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.690
If instructions are inserted into that part, it will print message instruction added and it will add

118
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.170
instruction.

119
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.270
JSP Which I'm going to create add instruction.

120
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.690
JSP Method, which is for admin part only.

121
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.300
It will print that instruction inside it.

122
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.180
If not, instruction is not added on that same page.

123
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:38.560
So this is very simple and this is only for the pushing or we can say only for the showing that message

124
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.640
on the database.

125
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:46.690
Similarly, we need to create some logout methods in previous part or we can see we can create one only

126
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.040
one button and once this is logout it will go to that first part.

127
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.440
But for some user friendly website, it shows message.

128
00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:04.960
What message it shows, it shows your log out successfully or if you enter, it shows welcome your name.

129
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.160
Similarly that for that purpose I'm going to create some another methods.

130
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.200
So these are very simple methods.

131
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:20.360
Logout Student And I'm inside the USB package only I'm using this.

132
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.560
Let me change to the startup part only because.

133
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:36.910
I'm spacing specifying all the libraries which I'm using because you can use or you can use directly

134
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:43.960
methods like you can always write first code and then you can import libraries because it will take

135
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.430
care of the importing all the libraries.

136
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.260
So it will import step by step.

137
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:55.560
So you need to optimise this to not start because it takes like it contains all parts libraries.

138
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.990
No need to specify specific libraries here.

139
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.550
So I'm overriding this to this only like these methods.

140
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.390
These methods.

141
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.000
So as I told you.

142
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.520
Oh.

143
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.900
So it has two methods.

144
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.130
Do get and do post.

145
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.990
Do post is for the posting purpose.

146
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.440
Do it is just for showing some information.

147
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.900
So do get is always if to then do post.

148
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.630
Do post takes too much time.

149
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.460
Even JSP is taking too much time for loading.

150
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.210
For that purpose we need to optimize everything.

151
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.220
But if I'm using JSP with do post method it will take too much time.

152
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:38.310
And where I'm using very small, small things like log out successfully and I'm just want to show this

153
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.830
part or station invalidate part.

154
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:48.420
I'm just put this once I click the logout button and to show this part only with student log in on JSP

155
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:48.870
page.

156
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.690
So for that to create method, it will take less time and it is very effective.

157
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.880
So I'm quoting here only.

158
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.330
Printing message method.

159
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:14.070
So for the printing message then logo, I mean, again, this is very simple method for the log out

160
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.110
and log in protocols.

161
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:19.590
Similarly for students, I have created only logged student.

162
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.020
Similarly, you have to create for the log in.

163
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.960
So you are again going to use these methods only log out students and everything.

164
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.590
So why I am using this?

165
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:37.440
Because for user friendly website you need to.

166
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.620
Invoke this or you can say you need to create this part.

167
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.270
Similarly, we need to create question insert part here.

168
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:51.540
So let us see how we can create one question, insert part or question inserted method here.

169
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:59.540
So for that purpose, inside the controller, you need to create one another method, which is basically.

170
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.090
Cushion insert method.

171
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.870
Create your solid.

172
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.440
Christian in.

173
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.540
And this is a very important step because it will create a new file.

174
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.940
And I'm deleting this all part.

175
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.010
So let us see how we can do that part.

176
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.280
So let me use.

177
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.910
Some methods here.

178
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.780
So what I'm doing, I'm importing these methods on.

179
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.510
Because these things remain the same here.

180
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.090
Or what I can do is.

181
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.290
I can.

182
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.500
Take it from.

183
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.780
Law student because it is already optimized.

184
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.140
But.

185
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.180
Okay.

186
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.570
So I'm importing all the libraries first.

187
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.510
Then what I'm doing, I am importing.

188
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:01.930
In poor.

189
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.050
Who is dot db.

190
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:06.530
Dot.

191
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.720
Christians.

192
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:18.020
Then what I'm doing is I'm importing model also here because that is not model.

193
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.330
DOD questions your contents.

194
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.710
That part.

195
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.790
Then you need to create one.

196
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.600
I did it with a solid method.

197
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:38.510
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just pitching this.

198
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:39.840
And.

199
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.610
I will explain here.

200
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.910
So let us see how we can create this.

201
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:46.400
Okay.

202
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.860
So we completed this part only because this is a very simple method, I'm telling.

203
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:57.440
So no need to put this again and again because it's a real Virgin annuity, which is basically defaulting.

204
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.470
Since I already created this part, let me delete this.

205
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.910
Okay, so question insert.

206
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.250
What is it will do.

207
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.880
It will take part from this method and.

208
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.430
Option, one option to an answer only.

209
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.250
So this will setting the answers.

210
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:26.350
And if the question is added successfully, it should print question added, but if not added, it should.

211
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.200
That question is not added with the same JSP.

212
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.450
So we need to create order.

213
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.310
We need to focus on JSP only.

214
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:41.410
So now we are done with the question insert or so we are remaining with some another method which is

215
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.150
basically student insert method.

216
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.910
So again, it is very similar thing.

217
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.750
So I will explain you are only once this is done.

218
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.480
We need to proceed with JSP files only.

219
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.920
So let me create one another.

220
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.610
Servlet.

221
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.410
You're.

222
00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.670
I'm adding in the Web dot XML.

223
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.890
I'm deleting this part.

224
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.510
And what I'm going to do is.

225
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.180
I'm going to fetch.

226
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.240
Similarly libraries in Europe because.

227
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.880
These things are always similar.

228
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.930
Then.

229
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.740
Instead of using that question input, I'm going to use student input part only.

230
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.500
So.

231
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.130
That's it.

232
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.040
So we are already done with the question.

233
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.880
Similarly, you need to create student insert part your.

234
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.370
So these are all different things, all already created.

235
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.440
So we need to focus on this.

236
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:47.430
Once this is done, you name, password and user name, it will print to the end insert to that database.

237
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.270
So we need to see how we can create JSP.

238
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.840
So now we are done with all our servlet parts we use.

239
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.070
Controller is done.

240
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.200
Also, I told you in the previous we are done with this and we are done with the model part also.

241
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:09.750
So now for the videos, I'm going to tell you how we can create JSP part only because we are already

242
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.590
done with this.

243
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.550
So step by step, I will tell you how we can create.

244
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:20.880
So I will explain the code because writing a code is very huge, because typing each and every statement.

245
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.580
So it's very huge part.

246
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.270
So I will explain the code.
