1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,160
So here is the checkout class which we are having.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,040
Let's understand it's code.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,320
So it is defined under the package hotel inside which we have imported the packages in the blue dot

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:22,530
border layout JWT Complete Package JWT Event Queue SQL Package Swing package swing dot bottom dot empty

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,770
broader package eight dot font package JWT Event package and AWG dot event.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,540
Dot Action Event package.

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,020
Now we have defined the class, which is extending the frame.

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,650
And we have established the connection object as null instance as null.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,910
Then there is a prepared statement and stands as null.

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:53,500
There is a private panel named as content pane and then there is a text field, the one which is also

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,700
of private type.

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,530
Then there is a choice.

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,020
Type variables.

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:06,210
See one then inside the main method we have invoked the event Q to invoke later inside which we have

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,300
defined the void run method.

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,950
Inside the try block, we have created the object of the current class that is checkout setting the

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:22,830
visibility of that frame as through and for the exception we will handle it using the catch block.

18
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,590
Then there is a void closed method which will dispose the current object and close that current of frame

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,400
and window.

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,930
Then there is a public check out non parameterized constructor of the class which is throws as well

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,410
exception.

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:45,130
If an exception will occur in this constructor, then it will handle by using throws.

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,300
Now we have said.

24
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,290
The operation, close operation of the windows, setting the bound of the window, initializing the

25
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:54,710
panel.

26
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:02,660
Then we have set the bar for the panel and setting the bar and adding that panel to the frame and adding

27
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,880
the layout of the panel as well.

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:14,520
Then we have added the image icon by using a icon, i.e. one converting it to the i3 by scaling its

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,370
instance from the object of I1.

30
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:24,650
Then we have created another image icon two to form the complete image from the image object.

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,330
Three.

32
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,660
Then there is a label l one.

33
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,760
In which we have added the.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,790
Image icon.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,570
So that label will be showing the image in the window, setting the label bound for that label and adding

36
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,030
that label to our frame.

37
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,620
Now, next is the another label label as check out.

38
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,480
Setting the font for it, its font family, its font type, and its font size, setting the bound of

39
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,340
that label.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,730
And adding that label to our frame window.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:08,730
Then there is a label name labels number, setting the bound for it, adding it to our panel.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,980
And there is a one choice instance for the choice.

43
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,790
We have created a catch block inside which we have.

44
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,910
Initialize the connection by using our icon class, executing the result set query that is select as

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,030
from customer.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,230
So it will start next will by loop that iterate over the rows of the customer and fetch the number of

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,380
the customer and add that to the choice object.

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,870
Then we have setting the bound for the choice and adding that to our panel.

49
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,770
After that, we have added an image and another button.

50
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:57,070
Then there is added an image to the button I added to and setting the button for Delta, adding that

51
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,900
button to our frame.

52
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:04,300
Then we have added the action list in the class and define the action, perform the method for the button

53
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,970
to so it is showing system dot then inside the drive log.

54
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:22,040
We have initialize the connection and a string number which is fetching the item from the choice executing

55
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,130
the query where the number is equals to number from the customer.

56
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,780
For the next 2 hours.

57
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,690
Start next.

58
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,800
Then system clicked and a room number.

59
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,700
Then there is a catch block after that.

60
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,490
Label or as room number, then we have set the bound for it, adding it to our panel text field for

61
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,800
the room number, adding to it our panel.

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,660
Then there's a button checkout.

63
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:01,180
This will define the action performed inside it to delete from the customer ID and it will update if

64
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,700
checkout will be check collect, then it will delete the record from the customer table and also from

65
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,310
the room and set the availability of that room which will be held by the customer till now.

66
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,350
Then insert right block.

67
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:21,370
We have delete a SQL query, executed the category, check out successful dialog box and move back to

68
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,870
our reception page.

69
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,060
Then we are bound for the button.

70
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,710
Background color of the button.

71
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,500
Foreground color of the button and adding that button to our panel.

72
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,240
Then there is a button.

73
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,940
Exit Nuland back.

74
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,120
Then there are channels now for that back button which will set the reception visibility as true and

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,380
current as false.

76
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,810
Bound for that button background.

77
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,910
Lot of the button for round a lot of the button adding that button to our panel at last we have.

78
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,670
Set the background color of the current complete window as white.

79
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,940
So let's look at the other class that is an update check or Java class.

80
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:12,900
So this is also defined inside the package hotel and we have imported the necessary packages.

81
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:22,300
Then we have defined the class update check, which is extending the frame connection type of object.

82
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,430
Initialize as null.

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,850
Then there's a prepared statement in slides as null panel and six text field here.

84
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,320
Two choices as well.

85
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,400
And inside the main function a string of.

86
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,650
Then we have defined the void run method inside which we have update, check frame and setting the visibility

87
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,910
of the current update check class as true inside the clause.

88
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,750
We will dispose the current object then inside it.

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,460
We have defined the non parameterized constructor which is throwing a SQL exception.

90
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,900
If it occurs, it will handle that setting the default close operation of the.

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,140
Current frame, setting the bound of the frame and setting the.

92
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,160
G panel.

93
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:22,360
Hiding the bottom of the G panel, adding it to the frame and setting its layout as null.

94
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,540
Then we have a label as checking details, setting the font for it, bound off it and adding it to our

95
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,140
panel.

96
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,290
Then there's the image icon we have created for the label element, setting the bound of it and adding

97
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,000
to our frame when under label as ID setting bound of it.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,850
Adding it to our panel.

99
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,390
Then there is a choice object for the choice.

100
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,010
We have created the connection inside the tribe log executed the query select restrict from customer

101
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,430
and over the data or record inside database.

102
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,140
We have to.

103
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:06,070
We have it rated by using asked next and added the number inside the choice.

104
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,170
Then we have set the bound for the choice added to.

105
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,220
Panel, then we will answer the label as room number setting bound for it.

106
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,600
Adding it to.

107
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,110
Adding the label number.

108
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,560
To our content panel.

109
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Then there is a text field sitting down for it.

110
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,220
Adding it to our panel.

111
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:42,110
Then there is a name label adding setting bound of that, adding it to our panel label as check in,

112
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:49,310
setting, bound off it, adding it to our panel label amount paid setting bound for it, adding it to

113
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,230
our panel label pending rupees setting bound off it and adding it to our panel.

114
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:00,860
Then there is a text field for text status bound of that adding to our panel.

115
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:08,360
Similarly for the text state here, that is for the text states adding bound of that, adding it to

116
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,110
a panel.

117
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,560
Similarly for the text field, that is time setting bound of it, adding the panel.

118
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,920
Text payment setting bound of it.

119
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,090
Adding to our panel.

120
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,630
Then there is a button update.

121
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,940
Define the action.

122
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,120
Perform method for it inside the action list now.

123
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,770
Inside the tribunal created the connection using the con class fetched the required.

124
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,010
Details from the text field and choices updated the.

125
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:56,270
Database of table customer for the room number, name, status deposit and the number.

126
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,570
Then we have showed as data updated successfully.

127
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,800
New reception object has been created as true and current.

128
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:14,120
Visibility as false, then we have set the bond for the button, foreground, background, color and

129
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,480
foreground.

130
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,310
Added that button to our panel.

131
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,320
Then there is a button exit.

132
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,010
Define the action performed for which we will move back to the reception window and current window will

133
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,790
be closed.

134
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,500
Then exit button bound.

135
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,240
It's background color, foreground color.

136
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,980
Then there is a check button whose accent performed event has been described here defined there is string

137
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,740
selected item which will select item from the choice.

138
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,980
Initialize the connection, execute the query select as from customer where number is close to s x as

139
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,240
one iterated over the records and fetched a.

140
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,610
Fetch the record from the text fields.

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,340
Then there is a string total.

142
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,150
As close to zero connection is lies the connection from the database.

143
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,250
Then there is an execute query we have selected from rule number where rule number is equal to text

144
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,520
id dot cat.

145
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,190
So it will select the room number from where it will match and we will total Isobel's to add to that

146
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:19,240
get press so it will use to fetch the price from that room number and paid is goes to text or get text.

147
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,640
So it will this will be the paid string, it will pass the paid string to the end and update the pending

148
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,750
variable.

149
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,720
Then we have added that button down.

150
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,160
It's background colour, it's foreground colour and added it to our panel.

151
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,920
Then at last we have defined the.

152
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,860
Background color of the window as white.

153
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,460
So let's see the output of these two classes.

154
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,770
Check out class.

155
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,540
Run this file.

156
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,090
