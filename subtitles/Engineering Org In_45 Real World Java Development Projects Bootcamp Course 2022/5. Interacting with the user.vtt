1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.110
Okay.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:09.540
So here I will have the next while loop because we have the Y loop for actually running the game here,

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.680
this one.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.030
So this y loop here is where we grab the enemy.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.640
The next while loop which we are going to have is for grabbing the enemy here.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510
So we have it, but then we need another value.

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.830
For one, we are actually in the combat with the same enemy.

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.970
We need to keep iterating until this enemy here.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
We have just created setup instead.

10
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.570
So we need to make sure this one dies before we move on to the next.

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:55.680
So firstly, we once we are going to go ahead and say here, I will say while under this enemy held

12
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.030
here and sacred with the operator greater than zero here.

13
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.520
Okay.

14
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.600
And we could have just simply go with the button just here and mean healthier.

15
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.600
Okay.

16
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.490
So it is greater than zero.

17
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.840
So that should be pretty straightforward.

18
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.860
The anime health is this random individual here so that we have generated between not and the maximum

19
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:44.290
anime health and we are seeing while anime while the enemy's health is greater than zero, that is while

20
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.030
the enemy is alive.

21
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.600
We are going to go ahead and do what we are going to do.

22
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.330
So first we need to set up for the user a list of commands that they can use because the way they are

23
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.900
going to interacting with the user in this game is we are going to be seeing which option would you

24
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.860
like to choose or pick?

25
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.290
And then and then there is going to be a one, two, three, four, etc., etc. and it's going to have

26
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.790
options for each one of level or the stage.

27
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.630
And then the user is going to have to input one or three or two or four and then hit enter.

28
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.490
So that's how the input is going to work in this game.

29
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.900
So let's go ahead and see.

30
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.870
Firstly we will say, okay, here, I will need our system, not our dot print.

31
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.870
Alan here.

32
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.040
Okay.

33
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.030
Okay.

34
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.540
Here, I will try it.

35
00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:03.940
Just simply slash the next thing, which I need your help potions.

36
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.960
Okay.

37
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.040
Okay.

38
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.990
We have to firstly, we need okay.

39
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.520
We need to print out the HP of our character means the health potion each time we fight this enemy.

40
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.130
Each time each iteration of a combat.

41
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.070
So you can call it if we want to print out our wealth, I mean, the health.

42
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.700
So we know how much health we have left.

43
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:43.850
So we are going to do and we are here tabbing and just your HP colon and just plus the health variable

44
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.360
health value.

45
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.590
We are going to go ahead and the next thing which we need the name of the enemy.

46
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.770
Okay, so in the next one which we need system.

47
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.380
Not our dot print.

48
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.760
Alan.

49
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.910
Here and here I will stand.

50
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.310
Um.

51
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.090
Just after that, I will blow this name of the enemy here.

52
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.530
String plus.

53
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.360
And.

54
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.660
Okay.

55
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.870
Just apostrophe S.

56
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.880
The key is to remove cologne.

57
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.610
I know the enemy health.

58
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.830
I want to see enemy health here.

59
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.590
And the next system.

60
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.460
Not not print.

61
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.880
Alan here and here.

62
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.530
I will need backslash and tabbed.

63
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.430
And what would you like?

64
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.800
Okay.

65
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.490
What would you like to do?

66
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.090
Read to your enemy.

67
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.650
Okay.

68
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.330
Anime.

69
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.450
Hmm.

70
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.540
Okay.

71
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.000
What would you like to do to your enemy?

72
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.850
And just simply the next which we need system.

73
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.810
Not our dot print under this.

74
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.390
The next thing the tab here.

75
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.740
I'm just simply right.

76
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.690
First option here.

77
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.880
The first option we will give is the attack option.

78
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.820
Okay.

79
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.640
And the next system.

80
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.860
Not our doctrine, darlin.

81
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.900
And under this, simply tap and put the answer.

82
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.500
The next thing which you need.

83
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.740
The next option which will be give drink.

84
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.910
Health, ocean.

85
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.480
Okay.

86
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.710
Another option I can give to the user here.

87
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.570
Be three.

88
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.710
Here.

89
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.350
Run.

90
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.370
Okay.

91
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.610
So here I have these, okay?

92
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:50.420
Where I have the enemy of the name of the enemy, and we have the enemies HP here and now we have only

93
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:58.250
health and thus we have the enemy health here and we have to give the option to the user.

94
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.480
So here we are going to make a line break after that, this one.

95
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:10.250
So here I have use a backslash and and we are going to do that with the backslash T and then we are

96
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.530
going to say, what would you like to do?

97
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.470
And now this is where we present our user with the options.

98
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:25.430
So we are going to go ahead and tab again and we are going to give them the option, the one for the

99
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:34.700
attack and next other two options which really we have the do for the shrink health person and we can

100
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.040
have option three for this run.

101
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.300
So we have given three options to our character.

102
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.580
We can either attack the enemy, drink our potion, or run away from the enemy.

103
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.010
So let's go down here a bit now.

104
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:56.870
And this is where we need to get the input from the here just simply first run.

105
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.450
Key.

106
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.770
Prison Island.

107
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.750
Okay, just simply run our program.

108
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:31.550
Okay.

109
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.560
Let's see.

110
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.910
So this will be the look of our game.

111
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.050
What would you like to do with our enemy?

112
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.710
So your HP and HP.

113
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.350
Really start with this.

114
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.820
So just run again.

115
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.450
Okay.

116
00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:02.570
Or each piece dubbed Skeletons HP or HP skeleton.

117
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:02.970
Okay.

118
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.270
So this is the next step we have to do.
