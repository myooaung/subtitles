1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,220
So we have said the switch cases here in the previous video.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,170
We have seen how we have done this.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,820
We have to take the value and convert it to that.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,760
First, we have to take the first country value and I'm going to do the balance here and take the another

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,330
which is not here.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,760
We get the value and convert it to the second country.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,860
So we multiplied it to the second country and in the default the user did not give any value.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,780
It should set it to the 0.0 here should the default 0.0.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,400
Now simply we will run our program and.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,690
Here.

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,530
So what we will do here?

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,600
See, we take some country.

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,000
Suppose around here we take the India, the Nigeria.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,590
And simply I write the quantity and let's say the convert.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,370
So here we get our value.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,670
It should be changed to this current value.

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,280
You can change according to your current value, whatever the current pound value right now.

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,730
So all this thing are going right now.

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,730
What we have to do here, the exit button is not work.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,320
So.

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,310
Okay, just a second.

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,520
Here the reset button.

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,860
Try this on 23.

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,350
Onward.

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,590
Now we have to set this reset button.

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,730
If we click the reset button, it should all clear this text field.

27
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:51,460
So simply, we have to design this reset button so that we click on it and we will write our code here.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So what we will try the first country not set selects selected near the index and we will go to zero.

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:18,520
Second country set, third set selected index with the zero here.

30
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,370
And simply we will write.

31
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,960
Next first grand three.

32
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,200
Not.

33
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,960
Send text and simply write to note here.

34
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:47,530
Last one is the text second country not said text and simply write it to the knowledge.

35
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,920
Check this working.

36
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,690
Too soon.

37
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,510
Right.

38
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,490
23 and no, we.

39
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,250
This is working, right?

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,430
So.

41
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,630
At all?

42
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,710
No.

43
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,890
What do we have to do?

44
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,150
One thing also.

45
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,320
We click simply convert.

46
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,160
We are getting these right.

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,590
So we have to catch this error.

48
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,970
String error.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,300
And simply solve this.

50
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,660
So click exit.

51
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,060
And what we will do.

52
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,290
Go to the.

53
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,530
It's an.

54
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,580
Simply what we will do.

55
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,380
We will check the condition here.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:15,410
So the first country dot get selected index is equal to zero or second country.

57
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,770
Not.

58
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,260
In selected countries.

59
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,800
Zero.

60
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,860
Or.

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,890
The amount the user has not given the amount.

62
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,840
Also search should also catch that error also.

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,660
So we will write.

64
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,770
First.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,030
Sorry.

66
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,570
Text first three.

67
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,530
Not get text.

68
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,790
Lord equals.

69
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,220
I'm the.

70
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,060
This one.

71
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,930
So we have to show the error here.

72
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:10,420
So we will write to option B.

73
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,720
Not true.

74
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,980
Message loud and clear.

75
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,030
We will give no.

76
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,150
And we will kill.

77
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,620
You must.

78
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:33,550
Let.

79
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,480
Both countries.

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,690
So again, here we have two.

81
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,530
Our message here.

82
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,520
We have the do or die policy here.

83
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,100
No information message here.

84
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,270
This is done.

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,310
Simply what we have to do.

86
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,760
We don't know what value also.

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:07,300
So I think, okay, so what we have to do now is.

88
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,460
Okay.

89
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,710
So this thing will handle other things.

90
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:24,290
So it will be goes with our this thing if the user did not put any input or did not choose anything.
