00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.230
Here we are.

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.500
Here is my my SQL Command Line client and the notepad file in which I have written all the queries which

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.750
we will have to execute line by line.

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.640
So first I will be validating my password in my SQL client.

5
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.970
So now I have entered my password and now the first query is create data DMS.

6
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.580
So I'll be copying this one.

7
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.650
The database DMS.

8
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.230
So this query will create a create.

9
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.050
What a type of database and the name of database will be DMS.

10
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.220
So.

11
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.850
This stating that karaoke one were affected.

12
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430
So the database has been created.

13
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.770
Now we have to create tables inside this database, so we need to use this database so the query will

14
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.400
be used.

15
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.510
TMS I'll be copying that from there.

16
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.980
Basting it.

17
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.340
So we use TMS.

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.540
So the database change.

19
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.810
Now we will be using DMS database and we will be creating tables inside this database.

20
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.720
So the first table will be for sign up class.

21
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.730
So I will be creating account table.

22
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:58.360
So the square says create what our table named as an account whose columns will be first username.

23
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.420
Second name.

24
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.890
Third password.

25
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.450
Then there is a situation which will restore the security security question and last is answer.

26
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.810
And so for that security security question.

27
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.410
I will be hitting enter.

28
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.150
So this is stating that query.

29
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.760
Okay and zero is affected.

30
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.640
So the table has been created but it does not contain any data yet.

31
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.580
Now I have to create another table.

32
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.720
That is the table we have created is for sign up class.

33
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.100
Now we'll be creating a table to add new customers and new customer class so that table will be create

34
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.000
table customer.

35
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.460
I'll be copying that from the text file.

36
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.940
This variation in create table named as customer which column has username id type number which will

37
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.840
be the ID number name of the user gender of the user.

38
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.250
Country of the user.

39
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.390
Address of the user.

40
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.820
Or customer phone number of the customer or email of the customer.

41
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.550
Now let's create it.

42
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.550
So the cable customer has also been created and is showing that query.

43
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.060
Okay, zero rows affected.

44
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.500
Now we have to create another table, which is hotels.

45
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.070
So to add hotels in our database.

46
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.260
So we need to create a table named as hotels.

47
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.720
So let's copy that query from here.

48
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.340
So.

49
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.840
Create table hotels.

50
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.850
Name Vaca 30.

51
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.400
Creating a table named hotels.

52
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.270
Her column will be named its touring name of hotel cost per day.

53
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.530
That is the cost for the hotel to stay per day.

54
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.610
Food charges and its AC charges.

55
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.250
Now I will be creating it.

56
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.280
So that hotel table has also been created with no rows or data inside it.

57
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.940
So now we need to insert hotels.

58
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.260
So there will be I will be inserting to hotel here.

59
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.400
So let me copy the first query which will insert detail inside the hotel.

60
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.650
I will be pasting it.

61
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.980
In certain two hotels values.

62
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.980
This is the name of hotel.

63
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.410
This is the cost per day of hotel.

64
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:13.290
And 2500 is the food charges and 3000 is the AC charges at inter.

65
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.030
So query one reflected.

66
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.540
Now I'll be inserting another values in the hotel table.

67
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.500
I'll be copying that from the text file.

68
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.070
Pasting it here.

69
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:43.340
So insert into hotels values for season hotel is the name 12 to 1200 is the cost per day 1900 is the

70
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.410
full charges and AC charges are 2200.

71
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.060
Let me create that this row also.

72
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.030
So I have added the details in the hotel table.

73
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.720
Let me show you that the details have been added in the table.

74
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.820
So I will be writing queries select.

75
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.450
As strict from.

76
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.310
Hotels.

77
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.220
Semicolon.

78
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.100
So here is the table for the hotels.

79
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.240
It is showing name cost per day.

80
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.880
Full charges and charges.

81
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.980
Everything has been added perfectly in our hotel table.

82
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:34.440
Now we will be creating another table, book table, which will let us know which user has booked which

83
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.040
hotel.

84
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.950
So let me copy that from here.

85
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.700
This is showing create table name as book hotel.

86
00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:02.880
It will contain username name persons that will be number of person days to stay.

87
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:11.220
AC Food ID number, phone and cost.

88
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.990
So booklet table also been created here.

89
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.420
Now we have to create the last table.

90
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.590
That is a book package table.

91
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:28.660
So there will be packages for the travel and tourism, this project in which packages will include extra

92
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.380
benefits.

93
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.020
So for that, we will be creating a book package table.

94
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.820
Let me copy this query from a text file.

95
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.360
I'll be pasting it here.

96
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:50.570
So create table book package, contain username package which type of package person's ID, number of

97
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.180
the ID phone number and the price.

98
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.710
So all the tables have been created in the database to check.

99
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.820
Let me show you that the these old tables have been created for that.

100
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.040
I will be writing very short tables.

101
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.830
Semicolon.

102
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.560
This will be showing tables and DMS.

103
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.170
So tables and DMS are.

104
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.700
Account book.

105
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.600
Hotel book.

106
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.260
Package.

107
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.840
Customer and hotels.

108
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:30.090
So these are the tables inside our database DMS.

109
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:38.100
So now let us have a look on the libraries, which we will be using.

110
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.050
And what is the structure of our project?

111
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.540
So let's move to our.

112
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.330
NetBeans.

113
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.850
Let me minimize these windows.

114
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.790
So here we are in our NetBeans IDE.

115
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.130
There is the Travel Management System Project.

116
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.250
Inside the source package we have icon and travel.

117
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.450
So inside the icon we will have all the images which will be used in this project.

118
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:12.260
And inside the travel we have all the classes, Java classes which we will be knowing about and our

119
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.370
upcoming videos and.

120
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.870
And explain line by line by line explanation of this these classes.

121
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:30.470
Now inside the library section, we have a MySQL Java connector which will help us to connect our program

122
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.750
with the database which we have just created.

123
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:43.010
And there is an RS to a XML file which will help us to model the table structure in whenever we are

124
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:50.030
showing any table from the database into our this project or output screen of this project.

125
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.150
So that will help us to model that perfectly.

126
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.320
And there is a JDK 17, which is a Java development kit.

127
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:03.020
I am using JDK 17 because it is compatible with my ID version that is 12.6.

128
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:10.430
You can use any compatible JDK which is compatible with your version of ID or either you can update

129
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.360
your ID as well.

130
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.490
Now let's have a look on this con class c0nn.

131
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.410
Which will be helping us to.

132
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.630
Create a database connection with our.

133
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.790
Database, which we have just created.

134
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.470
This will be helping to interact with the database.

135
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.620
So this is defined inside the package travel and it is inside which we have imported a package our dot

136
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.910
dot strict.

137
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:47.540
And after that we have defined the public class icon inside which there are there is a statement, instance

138
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:55.910
of connection type name as see and a statement instance named as s inside the non parameterized constructor

139
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.930
of this class, we have created a tree block inside the trip log.

140
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:00.580
There is a.

141
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.410
The statement which is showing Glasgow for him inside which we are past the argument compromise squared

142
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:15.880
or GDP driver this line will be executed only if you will have this my driver connector and your liabilities.

143
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.380
Otherwise it will not work.

144
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.150
So make sure that library is present in your library section.

145
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:30.580
This will help us to load the drivers which will necessary to establish the connection with our database.

146
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:36.760
Now we have initialized the connection instance C that is equal to driver manager connection.

147
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:43.210
So using the driver manager class and its method get connection, we are passing the first argument

148
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:51.130
as location of our database and second as the username of our MySQL server that is route and the password

149
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.120
I have reset.

150
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.320
That is my SQL.

151
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.890
One, two, three.

152
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:59.560
If you have not reset your my SQL Server password, then your password must be R or T as default.

153
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:06.610
After that, we have created the statement by using the connection instant initialize it to statement

154
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.370
instance as after that inside the cache block, we will handle any exception if occurs.

155
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:17.560
So this class will be used to establish connection with the database, which we have just created in

156
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.070
this video.
