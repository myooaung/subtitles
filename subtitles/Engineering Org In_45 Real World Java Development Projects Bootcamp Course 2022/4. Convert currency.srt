1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,950
If the user selected the other part, and if he wants or she wants to convert it to the US currency

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,430
or let's say to the Nigerian or to Brazil or the Caribbean, so, etc., etc..

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,240
So we have 2.9 countries one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,870
So we have to write a single logic for all each of these.

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:33,580
So it will be longer and simply if the here we have take the Nigerian part also it should also change

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,030
it to another these nine countries and here Canada to these nine.

7
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,730
So it should be a long thing.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,350
So what we can do, we can do one thing here.

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:54,090
We will take the first currency and simply convert it to the points here and then let to get to the

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,370
pound to the second currency here.

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,390
Right.

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,450
The first currency converted to pound and go to pound to the second currency.

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,530
So what we will do, we will go to the our project here.

14
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,070
We will.

15
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,610
Here.

16
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,150
We have to first convert currency, right?

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
So

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:27,100
convert currency to double name.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,560
It has to amount to change.

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,840
And we have to get the text right to right get text.

21
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,190
Sorry.

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,510
First two.

23
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,130
First currency tax regime has.

24
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,220
Text first, girls.

25
00:01:51,230 --> 00:02:04,370
You could not get text where we can get our text to buy these smarter calling and convert to the.

26
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:15,440
We have to pass this or write, download or stable here and pass this thing as the parameter.

27
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,480
So we have done this part.

28
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,200
It's no deal.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,990
What do we have to do when you when we have to take this amount in this area, will we have to change

30
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,370
it to the pound also?

31
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:50,410
So we will take a variable name, double amount in pounds, and initially we have to put it to 0.0.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,420
So it's done.

33
00:02:53,170 --> 00:03:03,070
Now we have amount to change and it go to the pounds and now what we have to do, we need another variable.

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,990
We have to first take another.

35
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,070
We have to take another error also to back here.

36
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,280
The party simply right.

37
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,230
No, simply to

38
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:38,400
name it as the US dollar and put the values here.

39
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,220
Nigerian

40
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,040
Nido.

41
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,240
These are the values.

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,770
Simply you can change it to the current one also.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Brazilian real.

44
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,090
Need to double Ghanaian

45
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,440
shilling initialize to one 32.53.

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,490
No one should be named to the new.

47
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:49,120
Mission repair rate inserted to the one nine.

48
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,480
Big trouble.

49
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,910
Indian rupee.

50
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,180
And it to the.

51
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,580
And the.

52
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,370
Cindy Biscoe, you just won.

53
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:26,310
Let's say to 92.23 another.

54
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,670
The last one will be over Pakistan rupee to double.

55
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,290
Pakistan

56
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,720
will be subjected to

57
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,880
122.

58
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,410
So we have to clear here on thing.

59
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,610
We have to clear these because we have to take these values as a multiplication.

60
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:14,440
So we will go to the design here and you go to convert here.

61
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:24,220
So now what we have to do, firstly, we have to write the amount in pounds and then we have to convert

62
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,630
it to the pounds.

63
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,840
So what we will do switch.

64
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,340
And.

65
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,170
Okay.

66
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,030
What's the first one is the first country we need.

67
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,430
Most country don't get selected item.

68
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,790
No

69
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,210
get selected item and convert it to the two string.

70
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,780
Okay, so here, this thing is done.

71
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,630
Now we have to write the cases.

72
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,260
So the first case will be of us.

73
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,140
And simply write us.

74
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:22,600
The right amount in pounds is equal to amount, amount, whatever the amount the user give.

75
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,130
So here amount to change.

76
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,950
So we have to divide because we already have.

77
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,560
These one don't happen to smudge dollars.

78
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,700
So what do we have to do?

79
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:38,930
Right.

80
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:51,680
So go to here and simply write Divide and you will send us this one.

81
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,090
We have initialize it.

82
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,200
And it's now another case when we

83
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,960
we already have these this one value here.

84
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:17,870
So simply it gives the calculation with dividing the value so we can get our amount already in the down

85
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,380
here.

86
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:28,160
So another thing which we can do, we have to take firstly, we have to take another such case.

87
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:35,070
And here we even get a second look.

88
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:44,690
This one gets selected right down to two string here.

89
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,290
We have to check.

90
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,410
Check the case

91
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,020
if it is in India.

92
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
The user selected India.

93
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,120
No what we have to do if they're already user connected to that phone.

94
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,740
So we have to convert it to the Indian rupee.

95
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,180
So take another variable.

96
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:19,680
The amount changed here changed and equal to 0.0 initially.

97
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:32,940
And now what we will do here, we will try it among the changed and now we have to take this amount

98
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,860
in pounds value here.

99
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:45,480
So we will right amount in pounds simply multiplied by the Indian rupees.

100
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,980
Okay.

101
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,310
So we have to convert it to the Indian rupee so we will take

102
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,030
this one, this Indian rupee simply multiplied by this.

103
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,330
This is

104
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,410
these variables only contain of Â£1 value.

105
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,060
Okay, so.

106
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,390
So now we are to do these similar things.

107
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,840
Just a second.

108
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,650
Firstly, we have to convert it to string.

109
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:35,860
Also, so do string value and write

110
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,190
string.

111
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,490
Not for married.

112
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,580
We have to.

113
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:57,540
We are doing this thing because if we get the amount in value and the amount and bounce, it will go

114
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,760
with the point after point values will be printed.

115
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,080
So we have to decrease it and fix it.

116
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,770
So what we will write here, percentage or in two?

117
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,330
And coma among you changed.

118
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,710
Soon it will dawn here.

119
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,480
And now we have to set this value in the.

120
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:33,830
Okay.

121
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,590
We need that.

122
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,030
Okay.

123
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,030
Text

124
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,000
16.30

125
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,860
set text.

126
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,110
We need set text and give the value to the value.

127
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,600
So it's done simply.

128
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,570
We will run our programme here and we will check the programme.

129
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:25,040
So if we choose a USA simply to and convert it to India here now we will convert this and record the

130
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,890
113.30.

131
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,090
So it's working, right?

132
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:39,760
So simply click exit and now we have to do this similar thing for every nine countries.

133
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,270
Right?

134
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,630
So we will do that thing here.

135
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,090
Mostly we have to write another case and simply write Nigeria.

136
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,610
Right Mountain sequel to.

137
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:09,110
Amount to change provided by the Nigerian one.

138
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,620
Nigerian naira have not tried to take part.

139
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,570
Okay.

140
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,890
This one lone break.

141
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,710
Another case will be.

142
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,990
Next case is over Brazil.

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,400
So huge the same thing amount in bonds equal to

144
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:49,360
amount to change and simply divide it to the Brazilian real and it's done.

145
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,680
Simply break.

146
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,290
This network is going to be Canada.

147
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,390
Mountain farms.

148
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,940
To change.

149
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,210
So do.

150
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,010
Do Canadian, I think.

151
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,460
Maybe we have not set a variable here.

152
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,230
I think.

153
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,230
Well.

154
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,120
Okay.

155
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,740
We're five.

156
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,920
So the next thing will be the Canadian dollar

157
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:53,100
and simply get the value, whichever the current value.

158
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,880
Me mean the double.

159
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,560
Go to your

160
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,200
now Canadian dollar and simply copy this.

161
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,950
Do it for another one.

162
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,840
Now, another one we have is a Kenyan.

163
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,480
One inch long and the next one is the donation.

164
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,900
The next one will be our India part and simply.
