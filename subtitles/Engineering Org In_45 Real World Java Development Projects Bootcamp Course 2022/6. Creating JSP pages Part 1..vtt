WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.890
So in previous part I told you how we created student anxiety question insert methods so we are done

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.810
with Java subject.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.510
So our main project is focusing on web pages because using JSP we are using.

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.790
So creating subjects is very important part because for the DB connection and we have already created

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.480
so for the database connection, I will show you the what things you have to use your or which queries

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.070
you are you are going to use.

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.740
So you are seeing some queries here.

8
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.000
So this is my some database credentials for admin table.

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.990
You need to create admin part here.

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.340
This which contains user ID and password.

11
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.220
Year 2020.

12
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.840
No need to specify more length or I'm using admin admin as a default part here.

13
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.820
You can use some other methods because admin part is only in the database or system configuration.

14
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.350
You cannot say that I want to become an admin, so create admin method or inside anything you can use.

15
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.710
Student method part but no need to create some admin.

16
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.410
JSP But you can say admin insert.

17
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.770
JSP So I'm inserting this and I'm switching admin admin as the default passwords.

18
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.030
Then student table for creating a student pot which contains all the related things as a name, password

19
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.870
and user ID.

20
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.260
Then instruction table which contains instructions.

21
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.320
It is 35 and only known to space.

22
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.610
One more then question table which contains question.

23
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.750
Option A.

24
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.560
Option B.

25
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.370
Option C.

26
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.080
Option D and the answer.

27
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.970
So we need to create some primaries.

28
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.780
Why?

29
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.970
We need to create primary.

30
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.490
Because this should be unique and not null.

31
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.350
Which parties should be unique and not.

32
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.030
You can not specify instruction should not be unique always or you cannot say that question is always

33
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.340
a unique for the examination purpose.

34
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.490
It's unique, but it should not be unique as a word to work.

35
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.490
So what is the unique thing?

36
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.060
Your only username and admin table user id?

37
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.570
So I'm creating unique ideas.

38
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.790
What I'm doing, I'm using as a primary key.

39
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.310
I'm assigning that part as a primary key with user ID and this you can directly use these queries and

40
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.010
you can execute inside your database.

41
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.770
My SQL or Oracle, you can use these queries.

42
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.700
So this is all about how we can set up our database.

43
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.000
Once this is done, you are done with our database part.

44
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.480
So we are now focused with only GCP part.

45
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.430
So let us again move our move to our JSP part here only.

46
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:58.700
So these things are done now as I told you where you have to create JSP part in a web pages as we created

47
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.840
admin log in here.

48
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.360
Let me close all these things.

49
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.180
Okay.

50
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.700
How do we login part?

51
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.940
Now we are now focused with only JSP part.

52
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.600
So we are done with this.

53
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.000
So after this, we need to create one admin panel, which is admin panel JSP only.

54
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.900
So let us create one admin panel here.

55
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.210
Or so create a webpage New Jersey.

56
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.770
Admin panel or I think you cannot see this is dialog box.

57
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.590
The new dialog box will open and you have to specify the file name and specify is the admin panel here.

58
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.570
Once this is done, delete this part because I am deleting this part also.

59
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.820
And I'm.

60
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.090
Going with this only as a comment.

61
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.730
So let us be.

62
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.190
I already created this admin panel.

63
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.950
So let me use that part only.

64
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.010
Okay.

65
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.020
So now we are done with this admin panel.

66
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.040
Remember what?

67
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.390
I'm using this.

68
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.970
So this is page language Java.

69
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.750
These are some default things you have to use.

70
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.350
Again, these are some scripts I'm using, bootstrap and everything.

71
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.370
Also.

72
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.440
This is username and if it's done it will not show anything because no need to specify anything.

73
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.520
If it's not, then it should specify that.

74
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.710
Please log in as an admin to continue.

75
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.030
As I told you in admin log in JSP.

76
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.050
Uh, is this part.

77
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.580
Please log in as admin.

78
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.440
So that part only again, I'm specifying this and welcome.

79
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.600
What is this?

80
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.410
Is printing the username which is specifying from that part.

81
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.410
And it's mercury only.

82
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.910
They're just for controlling.

83
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.760
Or you can say moving part in HTML.

84
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.340
Then what is showing it should so.

85
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.310
Student List.

86
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.350
Instruction List.

87
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.880
Question list.

88
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.320
Also it will create some logout admin button.

89
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.150
As I told you, we are already created controller for the logout admin button, so we need to create

90
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.100
that part also.

91
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.640
And question list contents, values, add and update the question and everything part.

92
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.540
So we are done with this.

93
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.180
So let me tell you what is this part?

94
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:55.510
So admin panel will contain some methods and which are which provides some buttons to forwards from

95
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.090
another JSP, but only if it's not providing the same part like this.

96
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.570
This username is not default.

97
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.300
Or we can say admin not it's not admin.

98
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.850
It should appear in that admin.

99
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.140
Please log in as admin.

100
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.540
If you're tired, it will end this loop and it will go directly to this part and print.

101
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.890
This will come everything.

102
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.610
And same.

103
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.990
This is done.

104
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.170
It should create some G-spot.

105
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.830
I'm going to create a student list.

106
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.900
JSP instruction list.

107
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.890
JSP which contains button and add an update.

108
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.170
Then these are some default classes inside bootstrap only.

109
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.440
So this is all about these things.

110
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.160
So now we can see how we can create student lists.

111
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.280
So let me copy this part because I'm going to create student list.

112
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:59.670
And I'm going to create new sorry, not create new and just be let me create one JSP file here and I

113
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:07.560
will click finish so I will delete this part and required this then also don't require this.

114
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.980
I referred only this comment to.

115
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.520
Those are.

116
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.820
It will specify what is this document for?

117
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.760
This is a document for student list.

118
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.080
So let me show you how we can create student list here.

119
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.380
So student list is very simple.

120
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.330
It's a little bit tricky, but it's very simple.

121
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.590
So I'm importing this.

122
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.530
What is this page dot import and where I'm using this.

123
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.550
So I want to import some libraries here or you can say system default things.

124
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:52.520
So in the JSP you have to use this syntax import is for the importing is equal to to specify what is

125
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.850
we are importing or is model dot store.

126
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.050
We are importing everything inside us.

127
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:02.030
DB I'm importing students and I'm importing ArrayList here.

128
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.750
You can specify a lot also, but I'm specifying only ArrayList here.

129
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.710
Now this is insert title here.

130
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:16.590
I will change this and which is basically student number, user ID and everything you can.

131
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.270
Mention it like this.

132
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.540
And what I'm doing is you're insert title.

133
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.340
Here I am instead of this.

134
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.100
I will print student list.

135
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.770
That's it.

136
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.820
So this will bring the student list here.

137
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.690
What is the number you can create, which is basically sequence number.

138
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.530
You can say a number.

139
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.240
You can also print its number.

140
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.490
User ID the name of that student.

141
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.690
Password of that student.

142
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:51.650
So as this is only showing for the admin purpose, it should get the password of that student also.

143
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.850
So it will show the password.

144
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.270
If you don't want to show the password, you can move that part also.

145
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.600
So I'm printing in the table or tabular manner.

146
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.690
So I'm using page and slash teach.

147
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:10.550
You should know some default things inside this and list of all students update and delete button I'm

148
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:17.660
going to create so I'm fetching it as a student video at least.

149
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.420
So always remember if you are using Java.

150
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.660
Then inside this you are to this arrow marks and this person marks enclosed with this you are going

151
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.760
to use this and all these things.

152
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:37.380
Then you started for the first column I plus plus because I'm iterating that for loop again and again.

153
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:44.940
One, two, three as usual then e not get username because I'm using e student e for that.

154
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.930
And remember this is advanced for loop inside java or for each loop.

155
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.270
You can say ArrayList.

156
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.500
Username gate name password for the updates to then DSP.

157
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.370
Now what is this?

158
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.160
I'm going to create update student JSP file.

159
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.860
So it will show me the H area which is basically links.

160
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:13.490
You can create a button also, but inside the table button is again taking much too much time to cease

161
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.240
that part.

162
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:21.230
So instead of this, I'm using a file which is basically directly links to update student or delete

163
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.890
student.

164
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.660
But again name e dot get username.

165
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:33.290
So remember admin has rights to add a student's delete student's update student for that purpose.

166
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:40.890
Then this button to add student because I need to add some students here.

167
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.510
So it will go to the admin student part.

168
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.340
If I click here back to panel, it will give me the admin.

169
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.490
So I'm going to create admin student part also.

170
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.470
So now we are done with student list.

171
00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.790
Let us see how we can create instruction list because we need to specify the instruction list also here.

172
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.440
Let me create another GSP.

173
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.460
Which contains instruction list in each.

174
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.800
I'm deleting this because it's not more required part.

175
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.960
Again.

176
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.200
This one only.

177
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.230
And I'm building this part.

178
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.420
Okay.

179
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.090
So let us see how we can create instruction list here.

180
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:33.810
That's it.

181
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.330
Let us see.

182
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.620
What is the instruction used here?

183
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.670
I am importing this again.

184
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.360
Import instruction below.

185
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.950
Importing DB file.

186
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.210
Importing ArrayList.

187
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.060
So let me change this as a.

188
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.850
Instruction.

189
00:11:59.270 --> 00:11:59.480
Just.

190
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.240
Again you can specify its number your.

191
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:15.550
Or then this is all things are related to HTML which contains this number instruction operation is basically

192
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.910
some adding part, updating part or deleting.

193
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.480
Again, I'm using ArrayList.

194
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.700
If update instruction JSP I'm going to create another JSP file for front end.

195
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:32.220
It will update if I want to delete, I can delete that part.

196
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:38.800
So remember, I'm what I'm going to use here again add instruction part for the add instruction.

197
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:45.550
If I want to click back button, it should go me to the back button.

198
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:51.010
Why I'm using this part because this is for the CSS, because it will show some.

199
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.240
I want to specify some gap, so I'm specifying this as a gap here.

200
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.200
So this is all about an instruction part.

201
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.880
So admin panel contains all these things.

202
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.710
So question list is also remaining.

203
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.490
Let us create one question list part also your.

204
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.790
Let me create a question list here, GSP.

205
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.610
So let me remove this part again.

206
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.730
Okay.

207
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.490
Let me remove this part.

208
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.360
So let me use that question list again.

209
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:44.900
Used.

210
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.020
Okay.

211
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.810
The whole question list.

212
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.930
Again, similar thing.

213
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.620
I'm importing all the waste model related to this.

214
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.940
Then DVI is for the database again as a.

215
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.430
Christian list as a title.

216
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.490
Then this is and this again is number.

217
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:13.820
So it will show me the question, then question a B seed options, correct answer update And if you

218
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.600
want to update that part or delete that part, I'm using this.

219
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:24.920
So this is similar as a student as we created using for loop but remember.

220
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:32.290
Whenever you are using the logic related to the Java, you need to invoke that syntax which is basically

221
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:42.370
this start and for the closing descent for sensible and that angular brackets here or triangular brackets

222
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.460
here, then object question and delete question.

223
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.210
JSP If you want to add a question, you can add a question here.

224
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.750
If you want to go to the back panel, you can go to the back panel.

225
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.220
So this is all about how we can create some list here.

226
00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:01.090
So this is the front part of the student list, instruction list and question list.

227
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:08.850
So in further videos how we are going to create some exciting JSP files related to the update question

228
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:14.700
delete question similar for object instruction delete instruction similar for object student and delete

229
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.150
student.

230
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.890
But also we need to create some add student JSP and different things.

231
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.700
So in further tutorials I will tell you how we can create that part.
