1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,040
So previously we have seen all the things here and how we created everything I told you.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,850
Now we are moving to the Ajax part.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,440
Ajax is asynchronous JavaScript.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,840
You can see the deployment part here.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:23,360
So it's asynchronous JavaScript and extremely it's not a programming language, it's a programming technique

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,930
model.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:32,120
Developing any JavaScript or JS projects is a set of web development technologies or techniques using

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,170
web technologies.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,250
Use client said created asynchronous applications.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,920
So why I'm using here asynchronous method.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,810
If I am not using synchronous method, let us consider to clients putting the request or blog or the

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,370
component anything on my page.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,210
Simultaneously.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,220
They both can get error.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,430
So I need to maintain two processes difference as a asynchronous part.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,600
So I need here asynchronous part here.

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,180
I don't want to create synchronized methods here.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,800
So I created one synchronous.

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,990
I want to create asynchronous part.

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,010
So I'm using your assets so web application can run, can send and retrieve data from server asynchronously

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,840
without interfering or display the behavior of existing page.

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,730
Because I don't want to change the behavior of that case, so just add that asynchronously.

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:32,070
So this is the more you can say file or you can say flowchart of objects working from the browsers and

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,260
events occurs within a single HTTP file XML file same is typically request to the internet server will

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:47,100
take care of this and it will create the response to the internet browser will be done or the process

26
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,430
will be written using JavaScript and update the page content.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,020
So that's it inside this and using Ajax going to use Ajax.

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,030
So Ajax is basically asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,530
It's not the programming language, I'm telling you, it's a programming technique to create asynchronous

30
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,250
methods.

31
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,100
So let us move to the ID.

32
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:15,840
So I created a few more things here with login process, which is nothing but for the login using email

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,000
and each passwords with some file system and everything I'm going to create.

34
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,950
Lynn Longboat for the JSP.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,320
Everything.

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,670
I'm going to create log only for the log out I am going to just session invalidate it will go to the

37
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,940
front page only then this is create.

38
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,140
I created open post.

39
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,780
So let me show you where I use Ajax.

40
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:46,520
So these are all Ajax things I'm using while creating objects, putting in this type and putting and

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,600
printing that part.

42
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,160
So that's an Ajax thing.

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm going to use it.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,650
It's very little thing.

45
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,920
I'm using this while you're creating the open post.

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:03,440
Also, I mentioned this example HTP server to put this Ajax find as you can see, fine name each and

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
everything I'm using here Ajax.

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,860
So that's very little thing.

49
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,600
Let us see what is these things?

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:18,140
And what the thing here specify is basically it's a load document file with some http, you can directly

51
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,510
embedded this and you can create the change content, everything here you can put this.

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,990
So that's it about how I'm going to create, but it's a similar HTTP request object.

53
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,570
So if you know the object, what is the object?

54
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,800
It's it can be used to exchange data between the server behind the scenes.

55
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,930
XML is http request object.

56
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,680
So you can use this object to request the data and it means that it sends a possible update parts of

57
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,500
pages without actually reloading the page.

58
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,450
Or we can say hold the page, it will reload that part only.

59
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,090
So that's asynchronous part.

60
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,630
So there are different methods in different things.

61
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,140
Using this you have to change check there.

62
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,040
But best thing is it's access across the domains.

63
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,600
No need to change the domain.

64
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,660
If you have same domain, you can use this or if you change the domain objects, it remains same.

65
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,990
So for the newer things you have to use new HTTP request things, everything about method you need to

66
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,530
create.

67
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,890
Then there is open method also same method also you need to create.

68
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,810
So that's all about thing you can create.

69
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,530
But remember about the four setters or you can say three statuses.

70
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,710
There are basically 200 is 44034 4,000,004 044.

71
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,410
Not for existing so.

72
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,990
If you know this, you are good to go to create a logic here.

73
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,610
So that's it about how I created a just logic.

74
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,700
So let me show you some more thing here.

75
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,130
I created one post to mention this again.

76
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,470
This is again some Ajax logic and I'm adding some things here, so.

77
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,210
Just remember these things that I use to mention this.

78
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:11,270
I just found some two locations as Ghaziabad and from Madhya Pradesh.

79
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,910
To put this and I found this on the internet, Modi just added random things here.

80
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,860
I don't want to mention focus on that part.

81
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,090
If you want to create for your own location, you can add that.

82
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,060
In an email.

83
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,010
Everything I'm going to mention here.

84
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,850
So that's it.

85
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,770
Who I created.

86
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,910
Let me show you one more thing here.

87
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,380
Register JSP.

88
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,940
So this is it.

89
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm going to register the process I need to mention here.

90
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,240
So this is it.

91
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm going to create.

92
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,610
But in further more things, I'm going to show you how I can perform these actions.

93
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:58,580
So we already created when my listener do deploy that web pages, then the status is for showing the

94
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,950
status, like the error or everything I'm putting inside this part only.

95
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:14,210
So due to time constraint, I already typed everything and I'm going to show you this development or

96
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,900
deployment.

97
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,750
In later part, I will tell you how I can perform these actions.

98
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,600
But before proceeding with this, let me add two or three files here first.

99
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,620
So this is how I can create, but you need to create one test part also upload part also.

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,570
So let me go with the login process here.

101
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,080
Okay.

102
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,000
So now what is these things I'm going to mention?

103
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:49,340
So these are the jobs and you need to mention this for quarterback or vice versa or the Oracle development

104
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,790
you can find on the Internet.

105
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,150
What is the tenure and public member for the public part?

106
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:03,120
So I'm creating username, I'm accepting and user password the user parsing method and boolean to create

107
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,960
one status.

108
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,080
Then I'm going to create Oracle and I'm going to create and mention the select part.

109
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,750
So once this is done, I can print hi in my command prompt to get that connection is done.

110
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,100
Once this is done, it will attribute said email to email username.

111
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,410
It will ask me for the sign first.

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,210
If I'm not directly, it will bring me username and password does not exist.

113
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,470
It will print or throw me from that page.

114
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,400
Which is basically log in page to the index page.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,500
Then, just as I told you, I'm here already.

116
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,310
I already created this part.

117
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,010
So this is it.

118
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,630
How I'm mentioning this.

119
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,260
But.

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,140
No.

121
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,000
Remember while developing the my listener.

122
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,300
Or you can say I already created this part.

123
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,530
So it will face that data from that part only.

124
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:19,020
And it will me it will give me everything here so you can use this, select everything you can use,

125
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,990
replace, execute, update you can do here.

126
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,280
So that's it.

127
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,760
Who?

128
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,960
I created this file.

129
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,410
It's not which I already mentioned, but.

130
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,150
Okay, so there are some things also required here.

131
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,360
Because while developing this before you start each row.

132
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,690
You can see this.

133
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,420
You can see I created from duel or everything.

134
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,910
These are all the please kill thing here I added to create triggers.

135
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,160
Similarly for the log in process, it will appear like that logout is very simple.

136
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,670
Once I click that logout it will decision invalidate message.

137
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,530
Then let us see open post here what is open posting mentioning here why I'm putting this again and again

138
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,700
while posting this.

139
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,800
I need to create one thing here.

140
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,850
So.

141
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,480
High school is very important here.

142
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,850
Because I'm going to add it to my school thing.

143
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,230
So me forgot to change this here, which is basically one, two, three.

144
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,160
So this will add it to my skill page while I am posting this part.

145
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,950
So a part will be similar, but after changing this part, it will move to another part.

146
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:57,400
So this is an open post theme which will face your post dimension in your if you are adding image,

147
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,190
you can add the image also here so you can do that.

148
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,550
Then I created open t post for opening this post and you can see I added this.

149
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,200
So I also in for what to change here one thing.

150
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,600
It is a distinct.

151
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,650
If you have another thing, you can change that.

152
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,110
Now, let me explain this first.

153
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,200
What are the listings?

154
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,030
So I'm adding this to everything here.

155
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,730
These are the functions I'm adding to the JavaScript.

156
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,940
And so this is very important, what I'm going to create if I am.

157
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,300
Could you please enter some text?

158
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,770
If I marry, it will find the names with the JSP as this is similar to the request window is similar

159
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,360
to its existing.

160
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,200
What is the next thing?

161
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,050
I told you earlier that I don't want to load or reload the file again.

162
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm going to load just that window again if name is name is found or something like that.

163
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,290
If not, it will unable to connect the server.

164
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,060
It will print me that error.

165
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,780
So that's it.

166
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,790
I'm going to put this.

167
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:19,530
So I just want to display that name after finding the name without reloading the full file because it

168
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,920
takes it takes time to reload everything as it is.

169
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:31,110
Localhost only I can perform this furthermore, but by developing this I can use Ajax similarly for

170
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,970
the post I created header GSP.

171
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:38,340
Everything I mentioned or registered GSP is again similar for registering this file.

172
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,970
So the thing registration process is again similar.

173
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,810
I already mentioned this part.

174
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,870
Then status GSP is again similar.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,060
He's going to show me the status here.

176
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,850
As you can see, this is good for you.

177
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,110
So always remember you need to.

178
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,980
Well, I'll mention your school.

179
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:11,730
It would explain everything neatly, because sometimes like this it will throw the error for me.

180
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,190
So let me save this or this is it who I'm going to mention in the next part, which is the last part,

181
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,790
I guess.

182
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,940
So in that part I'm going to mention you everything.

183
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,950
I'm going to specify the files and each and everything in the later part.

184
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,770
So this is it about all the things.

185
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,220
And in the further part, I'm going to put everything.
