00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.250
In previous cases or tutorial, we have seen that how we created them, basically gameplay.

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.440
So what our gameplay holds is basically it's going to hold all the game components.

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.820
So what is the game components are basically I'm considering as a breakout ball game.

4
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.500
So let me show you basically what is our components?

5
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.830
So our components are not very complex things.

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.000
Here it is.

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.060
These are just some things here.

8
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.980
So let me show you.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.780
So there will be some bricks as I'm showing you, like these are the bricks or what you can do is.

10
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.130
So let us consider these are the some bricks in our game like these.

11
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.130
These are in will be in order always.

12
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.230
And let us consider.

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.790
This is the window of our game.

14
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.430
Now there will be one platform.

15
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.940
In our game, which is going to move so which is going to move by user, which is basically left to

16
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.340
right on, not upward down.

17
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.060
It's going to move from left to right.

18
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.560
So let me give one color to each is like these are the red and these are all things that will be green

19
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.290
in color as I'm showing.

20
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.070
And.

21
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.750
Not all these things.

22
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.780
This will be on again.

23
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.530
So these are the same bricks considered as these are in order due to drawing is not in order at all.

24
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.450
But consider these are in order only and this will be the bricks.

25
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.210
So now what will happen when you start going to play?

26
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.740
There is there will be one.

27
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.190
Ball.

28
00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.500
You can say this is the ball which is going to move like from here and it will touch this part when

29
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.300
the ball will be touched here.

30
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.690
What happens?

31
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.080
That brick will be disappeared.

32
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080
That brick will be disappear.

33
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.220
So this is the brick and it will be disappear when it's going to move like that.

34
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.270
And or.

35
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.780
Like this, it will be disappearing.

36
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.680
But remember, all will be remains same.

37
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.140
It will be in the same position.

38
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.490
That ball will be bounced here and it will act like that.

39
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.000
So what are our bouncing conditions are?

40
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.800
These are our bouncing constraints.

41
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.260
Bouncing.

42
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.550
You can see these and this platform also.

43
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.680
But below this platform, there is no bouncing concerns.

44
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.920
So let us code something here, which is basically our coding part.

45
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.830
Now, this is my map generator.

46
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.010
As I told you, I'm going to create map generator later.

47
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.040
But this is the gameplay which I have already configured in the previous tutorial how you can set up.

48
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.050
I told you this first course.

49
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.090
This is for Padel, this is for Ball.

50
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:17.970
Now after the ball and everything, I need to give one thing, which is when you are going to win a

51
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.600
game.

52
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.030
Did we mention when you win the game, when you are going to win a game, what you are going to do?

53
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.560
Winning game is basically the total number of bricks in that window is zero.

54
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.090
So our condition is I'm going to mention as total bricks or you can give any other variable here.

55
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.860
I'm giving total bricks.

56
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.260
Which is going to be zero.

57
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.390
Greater or less than or equal to zero.

58
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.080
Now.

59
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.660
Let me tell you why it should be less than or equal to zero.

60
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.020
Sometimes that loop I'm going to iterate, it's going to be the minus.

61
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.320
And what is the exact minus thing is less than zero.

62
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.890
So we are going to win that game or user is going to win that game, player is going to win that game

63
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.210
if the total number of breaks in the four loop is depending on your gameplay.

64
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.110
So if it's less than zero, it will not appear on our gameplay window.

65
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:26.230
But at the back end for the calculation, there is maybe conditions like less than zero, so it will

66
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.300
not give proper winning conditions.

67
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.630
So for such things to avoid anomalies, I'm giving less than zero now play play I already created.

68
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.620
If you closely look here, play.

69
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.200
This is private, which is false.

70
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.540
But at the starting it is false.

71
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.910
But now, after winning everything, it should be always false again.

72
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.480
So why false is a condition of playing after winning game.

73
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.040
False condition should be appear.

74
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.800
It should not be true always after winning game, that window should be freeze and your one or user

75
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.270
one title should be game there.

76
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.790
So for that purpose I'm giving this now let me mention direction.

77
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.990
As I told you, X direction is zero because bold directory should be zero.

78
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.970
It's just like the grid part of grid part of our game.

79
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.600
So it should be zero zero now.

80
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.850
G dot said I'm going to use here.

81
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.210
Which is a very popular method in the n.w.t..

82
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.690
Cologne dot.

83
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.430
Let me mention the only.

84
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.980
I'm giving him the color red.

85
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.050
Then I need to set tone for text, which is basically -- font.

86
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.210
Oh, it's not giving me.

87
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.660
Okay.

88
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.050
On.

89
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.670
Okay.

90
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.850
I got my turn.

91
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.330
Now in this, I need to mention new one because I'm giving new phone.

92
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:10.940
And again, I'm mentioning one family serif, which is commonly used and it's open source for one family

93
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.470
then.

94
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.750
Font dot bold and giving mention as bold.

95
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.000
And let me tell you why I'm mentioning bold, because it should be in a bold format.

96
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.090
So the size should be in 30.

97
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.300
I guess that's enough for setting a title.

98
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.650
Now get dot drawstring.

99
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.710
Now that drawstring is basically.

100
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.280
It's going to draw that part, which is basically displaying that part in.

101
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.880
So it's graphics 2D.

102
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.350
There is no need to mention this, all these things because our Java will take care of that drawstrings

103
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.390
and everything.

104
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.870
So just mention this and let me mention as you one.

105
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:03.140
You want a message that after winning the game and to 60 X coordinate and.

106
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.300
TWA 800.

107
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.230
I think it's enough.

108
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.680
If you're a graphic designer, you will understand what this.

109
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.830
Let me tell you in short, also, you can understood this.

110
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.760
So.

111
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.030
Let me do one thing here.

112
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.230
Let me clear out this part.

113
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.130
Okay.

114
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.610
So let me clear out this part.

115
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.590
So when you are in a map generator, you can.

116
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.800
This is my window.

117
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.450
But in the actual part, what happens?

118
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.480
There are grid lines and each green lines.

119
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.610
So this is a vertical grid lines you can assume, always remember, these are always straight lines

120
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.840
or not.

121
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.020
As I'm drawing always, these are the straight lines.

122
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:58.520
And there are some horizontal lines also like this in a grid.

123
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.320
So there are many horizontal lengths and each are having some meaningful names.

124
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.490
So this is our X coordinate and this will be our Y coordinate.

125
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:13.250
So as per our matrix, this is X and this will be the Y in the gameplay.

126
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.480
And what happens?

127
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.940
Actually, there are too many things.

128
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:23.540
So when I mention this to 16, it means from top to bottom at the number of 260.

129
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.230
And from y coordinate at number of 300 so it will appear something in the middle.

130
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.910
So that's a middle constraint.

131
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:40.500
You can say 260 to 300 is for X coordinate to 60 and y is 300 is basically like top of some time middles.

132
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.150
So you can assume like that.

133
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:48.570
Now I need to again mention the color.

134
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:56.930
For one simple thing, which is basically our score, which I'm going to because you one and your score.

135
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.920
So for that purpose I'm giving color and again I'm putting as a red only.

136
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.700
So now you can do that.

137
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.870
It's giving me the.

138
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.840
That part.

139
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:14.620
Let me get color, which is basically again your turn and everything.

140
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.620
Now get set.

141
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.840
I need to mention again, same font.

142
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:28.390
So what you can do is I'm copying this text because I'm going to set that font again, but.

143
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.870
With same font but lesser size.

144
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:38.390
And what I'm now going to type is basically get drawstring.

145
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.410
Again, I'm going to mention drawstring.

146
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:49.620
This is not at all like where I'm telling you the graphics to its older method of doing in AWP, which

147
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.950
is a Java swing.

148
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.320
Now it's not required.

149
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.080
Press.

150
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.280
In both.

151
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:00.700
Do.

152
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.510
You start the game now.

153
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:11.510
I mentioned you start the game and now I need to mention the coordinates again.

154
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:17.540
And now I'm moving a little bit downwards, as you can see to 60.

155
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.120
I'm going a little bit downward with 350.

156
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.230
It's enough, I guess.

157
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:27.500
Okay, so this is the winning condition of my game.

158
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.880
But what will happen if my I lose a game?

159
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:39.830
So if you remember, I created one thing here, which is basically.

160
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.270
But look, if this is this is over a paddle, which is basically player.

161
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.150
So if you look out this hour, this is 550.

162
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.040
So assume that our location is 550.

163
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.050
The ball location is 550 at paddle.

164
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.540
So it on the paddle.

165
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:06.350
But below that paddle, it started from 555, 65, 60, then 570.

166
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.830
So what is the losing condition?

167
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:17.210
When condition is ball goes downward, then that paddle, which is basically if you consider this as

168
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.610
my playing area.

169
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.760
And this is my panel.

170
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.280
If.

171
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:32.920
This is my ball and ball goes to downward this so this is 550 this top consider as this is 560 it goes

172
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.840
to downwards it's 570.

173
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.190
So if ball.

174
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.520
Like moving from this, this, this and type.

175
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.760
Go to that again, bouncing and going downwards, then this pattern.

176
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.440
That's a losing condition.

177
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:51.380
So for that purpose, what I'm going to do, I'm now mentioning I mentioned the winning condition.

178
00:11:51.380 --> 00:12:00.770
Winning condition is only one, but no one need to mention when you lose the game, which is basically

179
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.150
condition.

180
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.510
Again ball position.

181
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.210
What position?

182
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.110
Why now?

183
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.880
Why am not mentioning exploration?

184
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.970
X is only a horizontal position and there is no limit for horizontal like in the two constraints.

185
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.770
What can we move from that end to end?

186
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.110
But in the while it's not like that.

187
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.250
It should be a pad alone.

188
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.780
So for ball position.

189
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.380
Why?

190
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.840
Is greater than 570.

191
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.510
If Board Position Y is greater than 70, you are going to lose the game.

192
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.060
So it is basically again false condition.

193
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.300
You cannot play further when it's going to downward.

194
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.470
So play false.

195
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:40.160
Again.

196
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.750
Each direction you need to mention is zero because it should be a zero.

197
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:52.930
Then y direction should be again zero, which is basically normalizing the ball position I already mentioned.

198
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.440
So let me mention as y.

199
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:57.560
Why direction.

200
00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.070
Then.

201
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.720
No.

202
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.210
Or I need to mention game over or something.

203
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.650
So for that purpose I need to mention set color methods.

204
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.380
So again, I'm telling G set color is for the setting.

205
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.600
And let me tell you what is the G here.

206
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.650
So if you.

207
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.700
See I created your paint, which is graphics method in a w t and I am again and again mentioning g as

208
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.420
our graphics methods.

209
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:32.900
So I'm calling that graphics methods which default a w things with color dot red.

210
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.150
Or I need to mention one family also.

211
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:45.370
So please allow me to copy this text again because I already quoted that part and 30 and.

212
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:53.230
I need to mention this drawstring again, which is basically printing that string in that console,

213
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.490
but this time not one.

214
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.030
Which is basically game over.

215
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.200
And let me mention as like this.

216
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.180
And like this.

217
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.650
And for this, this is.

218
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.640
Okay, so this is for the game.

219
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.090
Over.

220
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:21.690
But while your game what you need to mention score also so now I'm what I'm going to do is I am going

221
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.130
to mention score.

222
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.590
Game over.

223
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.720
In this only score.

224
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.640
And I'm going to mention school.

225
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.720
And again, less.

226
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.120
So I guess I made mistakes.

227
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:38.720
No.

228
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.440
It's basically for iPhone.

229
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.440
So when you're these things are done, you should be mentioned as a score.

230
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.600
And this, which is basically going to print a score, final score of the game over ten.

231
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.620
Or again, gay or straight color, which is basically common thing.

232
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.280
Press enter to restart the game.

233
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.420
So this is again, same thing.

234
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.470
I'm going to call.

235
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:18.060
No, I need to dispose these things, which is basically when game is not started.

236
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:25.850
It will catch that, but our system will catch that part of our game will catch some parts here.

237
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.960
So I don't want to work like that.

238
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.090
I need to dispose it.

239
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.030
Lake.

240
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.230
It should not be mentioned again and again.

241
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.330
Game over, game over.

242
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.840
Thing you want, because it's like a storage of memory.

243
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.880
So while working on real platform games, you can see your statistics.

244
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:51.170
So they are not disposing, they are storing that kind of you can see storage or they are creating other

245
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.990
files, text files to storage, your data.

246
00:15:53.990 --> 00:16:02.090
But considering as of this game what is we need to mention, we mentioned that I'm going to store anything,

247
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.550
so for that purpose I need to dispose it.

248
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.600
Otherwise it will give me errors for this course.

249
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:16.610
Or it will again and again putting me the you one, you one thing even how this is totally bricks are

250
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.690
going to be zero.

251
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.620
But if it stores that in a cache memory, it will not dispose.

252
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:29.720
So I need to mention as a dispose here also so this is done part for this void paint in a little part

253
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:36.110
I'm going to show you what is the key place things I'm going to create key events then key release events.

254
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:43.130
Also I need to mention with some more things I'm going to create here, which is right and left things

255
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.940
and some ball position things because these are some complex things.

256
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.120
So this is just a drawing, but we are done now.

257
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.110
We need to move to the basic game logic part, how it's going to work.

258
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.790
After that we will create a map generator.

259
00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.350
It's very simple program map generator, how we are going to place that generator map.

260
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.860
And one last thing is basically we are going to call it in the main.

261
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.720
All these methods are calling in the main.

262
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.890
So it will help to understand object oriented coding and programming.

263
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.540
Also hope you understand.

264
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.440
Thank you.
