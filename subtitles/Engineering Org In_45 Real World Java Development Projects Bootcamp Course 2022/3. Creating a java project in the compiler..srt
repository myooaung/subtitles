00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,410
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:11,410
So in this series of Megan Java projects, we are going to make a new project again and going to add

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,870
this snake of really a game to your hit list of making Java projects.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,020
We have already covered many projects.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,320
Now we are going to make this project also.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:32,770
So let's begin making the project in our favorite tidy Visual Studio code by creating a new Java project.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,120
So.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:42,040
Clicking on the file icon and clicking on Create Java project insert in the file icon.

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:52,370
So after clicking on this button, a popup asks for option that what are the tools we are going to use

10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,020
while making this project?

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,980
So we have no use of this library.

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:07,360
So we will click on this mobile tool option and select this after which it asks for a path that where

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,850
we want to store our project.

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,390
So suppose I want to store the project inside my desktop.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,890
So selecting the project location and then.

16
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,160
It asks for a name of the project.

17
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:30,930
So my choice of name says that I should name it as snake failure.

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,360
Feed the snake as we are going to feed the snake in this game.

19
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:45,450
So after inputting the name for this project, we have to hit enter so that we will enter in the frame

20
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,840
where we have a new Java project.

21
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,800
So after hitting enter.

22
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:59,670
So I have already a project named like this, so I will try something other like the snake.

23
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,780
Ofelia.

24
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,160
Yes.

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,640
So the folder will be named as the snake of failure?

26
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,020
Yes.

27
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,100
So we are inside a new Java project with some inmate folders inside it.

28
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:23,260
We have the starting window where we have a dot vs code and dot based extension folder and we have a

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,960
lib and SRT folder.

30
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:31,150
So the SRT folder is going to be the core of this project inside a RC folder.

31
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,980
Only we are going to build the files required in this project.

32
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,540
The classes will be consistent inside this SRT folder.

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:50,440
Only the SRT folder already has a Java file which contains the app class which runs whenever there is

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,690
an exception in the application.

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,850
This file is for the handling the exception if the project is not able to run or there is any runtime

36
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,560
error in the project.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,990
So we have already listed the factors of error handling, exception handling in the previous videos.

38
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:20,170
Also in the previous videos we have covered how to install this application and how to run the execution

39
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,150
of the compiler, the JDK and everything.

40
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:33,640
You can check those video if you already have no Visual Studio code and JDK in your system, and then

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,490
come here to make this new Java project, which we have created right now.

42
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:47,980
Okay, so we have successfully created the frame inside which the project is going to be made in this

43
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,910
compiler.

44
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,890
Now we have to import the requirements of this project.

45
00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:01,240
Like I have already told you that we require images of Apple, which is going to be the object.

46
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,210
And for the snake we have to import images of dots.

47
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,310
We had an green dot or I can show you.

48
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,790
Yes.

49
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,250
So we have a green dot, red dot and this apple.

50
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,840
So we have to import these three images first to begin making this project.

51
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,500
So before going to start the programming path, let me import the icon.

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,970
So here we have an apple dot PNG folder, file a dot dot PNG file and a head dot being defined.

53
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:43,390
So this is inside this icons folder and I am going to drag this inside my SRT folder.

54
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,730
So here we have icon folder which contains a green dot.

55
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,720
I can zoom in.

56
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,460
Yes.

57
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,030
So it is an apple?

58
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,200
Yes.

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:02,600
We have the green dot, which is going to be the body and the tail of the snake and the head of the

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,100
snake as a red dot.

61
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,340
So we have successfully imported the image requirements for this project.

62
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,770
Now we have to start making the project by creating classes.

63
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:26,830
So in order to create the frames, we have to create a class called Snaked Java as a new file inside

64
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,330
the folder.

65
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,390
And this is going to give us the snake class.

66
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:32,880
Yes.

67
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,160
So here it is.

68
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,500
Similarly for the board, this is the board which will set the frame.

69
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,000
So to make the board, we have to create the board Java file.

70
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,800
Inside the SA folder as well.

71
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,420
There is no other path where we are going to create the folders.

72
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,970
So yes, only necessary folder.

73
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,870
We have our icon, we have our app dot java file.

74
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,040
We have bought Java and Snake Java.

75
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,560
All the classes are inside this SABC folder only.

76
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:16,710
Now switching to the prototype which we already made for the project, we will check the points which

77
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,820
we have covered.

78
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,260
Like we have created the new Java project.

79
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,550
We have added the images to the project and now we have to start creating the frame.

80
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:38,460
So to start creating the frame, so the snake class is going to be the main file which will be responsible

81
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,830
for running this snake game.

82
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,770
We have created a board Java class also, so we have two classes.

83
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:54,570
Of course we can make it in a single class also, but the code will become complex and it would be difficult

84
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,700
for you to handle that.

85
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,530
What function is doing what?

86
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,830
So to make that things distributed, I created two different classes.

87
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:14,280
So to begin with the coding part, let's create a constructor called Snake and Inside which we are going

88
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,390
to add the functionalities, what the game is containing.

89
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:28,220
Now, just after creating the snake object, I am going to call this object inside a public static mean

90
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,030
function.

91
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,680
Public static void main.

92
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,930
And the argument goes as string art.

93
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:49,910
So yes, the object is created, the function is created, the object is going to be called inside this.

94
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,000
So we have created it.

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,170
And now.

96
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:03,980
Adding braces and inside which the frame or third part of the prototype was to create the frame.

97
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:12,050
So using the new keyboard, I am going to call the snake object, which we have just created in the

98
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,480
line number three.

99
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,180
Yes.

100
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,720
So the visibility is by default.

101
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,310
NULL or false.

102
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,910
So we have to set it to true to see the frame on our screens.

103
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,070
So we have set the visibility of the frame as true.

104
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,420
So it is showing an error.

105
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,020
So let us check what the error is showing.

106
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:51,180
While so we have set the axis specified as public, we have to change it to private.

107
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
So there it is.

108
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,800
Coming through.

109
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,950
So there it is.

110
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,060
Still there.

111
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,280
We have to remain the class access specified as public.

112
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,620
Let us check for the other way.

113
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,110
Like, Oh, this is set visible, not set visibility.

114
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,710
Some typos are such a headache.

115
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,220
So we have set the set visible to true.

116
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,310
Now let us import that we are setting the frame to true.

117
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,590
So firstly, we have to import the frame.

118
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,010
So that frame is inside the Java String Library.

119
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,960
So it is imported as Java X dot swing dot.

120
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,040
It is like all of the components are need to be imported.

121
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,050
So we are giving it asterisk.

122
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,490
So perfect.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,980
Now that class has to cover the inside the frame.

124
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,810
So we will extend this class as a frame.

125
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:03,820
As the frame is the component of the Java String Library inside which we are going to create the application.

126
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:10,930
So we have extended this to the frame, imported the Java String Library and.

127
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,830
And perfect.

128
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,960
So we have created a frame we have set its visibility to.

129
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,470
True.

130
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,900
Now switch to the board dot java class.

131
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:31,280
So in the board class, similarly, we have to import the string package as it is needed everywhere.

132
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:40,370
So importing the string and after that one more package is need to be imported, which is AWP.

133
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:52,340
As string is built on the top of the WP Java dot, it is also needed with same importance for this project.

134
00:10:52,370 --> 00:11:03,470
So Java, JWT and similarly the string as we have to use most of the packages components of this package.

135
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,520
So yes, we have created the class.

136
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,180
We will extend it to Japan.

137
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,500
Now, you may be wondering that we extended the.

138
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,670
Snake, but as a frame and we are extending this as a panel.

139
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,220
So there is a panel inside which the frame is to be consistent.

140
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:34,120
We can't put the frame, head and hair at the both places, which is not practically possible.

141
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,000
The program will give an error.

142
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,560
So we have created a panel inside which we are giving the frame.

143
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,920
So the board is a panel extension.

144
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:54,430
Now we will create a board object or constructor, whatever you wish to say it, and in the similarly

145
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,080
setting, the dimensions of the frame.

146
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:09,130
So set preferred side, we have to set a size from before the frame like if it is new.

147
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,730
X it's like the size should be ten as new dimension.

148
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,430
And removing this unwanted lines from the new dimension.

149
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:33,200
And suppose we want to give the height and width of the frame at 303 hundred.

150
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,220
So we have given the size us 303 hundred for both height and width.

151
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,860
This is unwanted.

152
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,480
So we have set the frame size.

153
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,350
303 hundred.

154
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,410
Now switching to the snake class and calling the board there.

155
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:02,270
So for calling the board there, we have to add a board object inside the snake object.

156
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,760
So the board object as new or not?

157
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,510
Not simply new.

158
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,310
The new board and the brackets and closing.

159
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,280
So let us try to run this and see what happens.

160
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,820
So the snake class is the main class.

161
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,120
We are going to run the Java program.

162
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,930
So yes, the frame is perfectly created.

163
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,920
You can see there on your screen the frame is created.

164
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:41,360
Now we have to open this in the full size window, like in the middle of the.

165
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,380
Page.

166
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,790
So adding.

167
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,660
One more line in the code which will responsible for doing so.

168
00:13:52,870 --> 00:14:00,480
So we have called back and now we will try to run this and retain.

169
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,200
So perfect.

170
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:13,430
We have a full frame which we have created of size 303 hundred on running the Java for the snake class,

171
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,540
after which we have successfully created this.

172
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:25,490
Now we have to add the snake and the apple object image inside this frame, which we will be covering

173
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,720
in the next part.
