1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:08,880
So in previous videos or explanations, I told you how we are proceeding with this.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,870
So I imported this in my part, and now what I'm going to do, I'm going to mention some code here.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,740
So let me go to the project structure.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,060
You can change the views of your packages.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,720
Also here, you can check or you can see project structure also.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,550
So in CRC main in Java, you can see this is my package basically.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,010
So I don't want to go in further apart.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,560
So what I can do, I can just switch to the package view and inside the package I can see the packages

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,100
also.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,560
So this is all the things and these are application properties, which is basically the application

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,310
things here.

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,690
So as you can see, this is the application properties files you can check here.

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,570
So let me close this.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,610
And what I'm going to do now is I'm going to invoke some things here.

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,570
So let us check.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,820
What I'm going to mention here is basically.

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:17,730
So before going in for the part, I need to mention one thing here, or as I told you, I'm going to

18
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,360
use your one CSV file, which is basically from raw data file.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,290
And I'm using here when you get a raw data file, it is deploying in every day.

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,790
It is updating it in every day.

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,250
So I'm going to fetch data from that file.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,330
You can use any other thing, but my recommendation is check for the headers, check for each CSV file

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:39,930
or not.

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,150
So these are some important things.

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,710
So in this part, what I'm going to do, I'm going to mention one thing here.

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,640
So let me right click this.

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,030
So okay.

28
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,520
So let me right click this click new here.

29
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,650
I'm creating Java class here.

30
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,760
Well, you can use my directory structure.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,290
You can go by file name.

32
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,490
You can go to class.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,550
Let me go with click new.

34
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,510
Java class.

35
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,790
This not.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,550
Okay.

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,900
So what I can do.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,770
I can go to the projects of you.

39
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,180
In this application.

40
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,740
Click New.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,360
Don't.

42
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,360
Now what I'm going to engineers is basically coronavirus data service.

43
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:57,950
So what it will do, it will create a service package with some this which is basically our class and

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,980
it is going to fetch the data for us.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,090
So clearly tender.

46
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,670
So what happened?

47
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,980
Basically, it's created a service.

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,900
So if I go to packaging, you can see services is created here.

49
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,830
So this is my another package.

50
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,510
And let me.

51
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,070
Go with that side.

52
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,800
Let me zoom this part later.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,240
So this is my package.

54
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,190
Go with this.

55
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,840
And this is basically our service.

56
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,170
So I imported this file, so.

57
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,020
I need to mention that you are a data first.

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,110
So what I'm going to do is I'm giving up your private.

59
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,560
It's that big.

60
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,120
Or your data.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,840
Basically, I say, which is basically string only string.

62
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,130
And the name I'm going to specify is virus data URL so you can use anything.

63
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,350
But I already coded some part here.

64
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,210
Why is it a URL and let me go with this.

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,780
So let me mention the data file here or we can see you are here.

66
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,910
You can use any other thing here.

67
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,740
But as I told you, you you need to maintain the or basically it's a CSV file check for each CSV file

68
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,250
or not.

69
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,780
If it's not a CSP, you have to check the ceasefire.

70
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,490
I am using your data raw data failure.

71
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,620
I told you, I mentioned your little data file.

72
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,870
What is data you really remote.

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:56,200
So now what I'm going to do is let me create one thing here or let me mention something here.

74
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:05,530
So this is basically the statistics, but I need to append this list in one location status because

75
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,670
it's location wise.

76
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,750
I need to create one list here.

77
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,390
So let me mention this list.

78
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,090
So I'm going to explain you.

79
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,020
What is this thing?

80
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me enter this basically.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,620
And what I'm going to do is.

82
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,660
Let me start this.

83
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,560
Okay, so location stats, I'm going to explain you.

84
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,680
What is the useful thing here?

85
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,830
I'm going to mention here.

86
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,780
So this is the basic thing I mentioned.

87
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:38,000
Now let me create one thing here, which is basically list, public list.

88
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,550
Location.

89
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,590
Start with all stats, so it will get the all statistics from that.

90
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,240
So it is the location style.

91
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,830
So I will explain you later.

92
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:58,410
What I'm going to do is here, so I'm just invoking the URL, but what I'm going to do is I need to

93
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,170
create one method to face that things.

94
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:08,700
So in this class only after closing this, let me mention one method to face the data.

95
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,310
So let me create public.

96
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:12,990
Boyd.

97
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,250
Which could be data.

98
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,560
Or we can see which virus data.

99
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,250
This is my method.

100
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,140
So.

101
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,340
Okay.

102
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,250
As I told you, we need to mention this again.

103
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,800
I need to mention the this thing.

104
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,870
I'm going to create location stats.

105
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,130
Don't worry about it.

106
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,160
I will create it later in later part.

107
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,640
Let me create one HTP client here.

108
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,840
HTTP.

109
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,060
Client.

110
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,620
So remember, this is a Java thing and what I'm going to mention is here.

111
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,060
So dot net, java dot net file is HTTP client file.

112
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,050
And let me create one client here, which is basically name as the single class first.

113
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,930
Client is equal to.

114
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,480
New.

115
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,440
And she declined.

116
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,660
So this is all about how I am going to do this.

117
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,300
Okay.

118
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,540
Okay.

119
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,750
I forgot to mention our client is not this basically.

120
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,930
I'm explaining this again.

121
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,840
The thing is to create a strategic plan.

122
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,620
So basically http.

123
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,420
Client dot new.

124
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,960
It should be client.

125
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,490
That's it.

126
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,910
I need to mention the tip line to receive the client request.

127
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,730
So let me create one builder thing.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,480
What is the builder thing is basically a HTTP request.

129
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,160
Steep request.

130
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,210
Or let me mention this as a request only so variable.

131
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,910
You can use anything here.

132
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:17,580
CDB request is equal to request with some builder class, which is basically http.

133
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,000
Request, not new builder.

134
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,390
Or we can say of a new builder.

135
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,280
The new builder.

136
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,960
Not so by mentioning the DOT, as I told you, our data is you are not.

137
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,980
You are.

138
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,750
I think I need to mention.

139
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,830
Here you are.

140
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,700
I also.

141
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,990
You are so you are.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,990
I is basically nothing but integrated.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,560
You can say you are.

144
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,430
I create and I'm going to mention this virus data.

145
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,830
Is that a URL?

146
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,820
Unless I mention I need to mention one thing here is building.

147
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,180
I need to build this.

148
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,990
So build this.

149
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,900
So I mentioned this, so we already created this.

150
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,140
So I need to mention one thing here is this is basically htp url.

151
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,690
Our request is but I need to mention it.

152
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,350
So you are.

153
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,090
You are.

154
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,940
I is embedded.

155
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,270
So I need to create one embedded thing here.

156
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,620
And I mentioned this.

157
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
So forget about these things.

158
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,050
I'm going to create the ArrayList for that purpose to store the location.

159
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,430
I already created this.

160
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,850
I'm going to run this project after all the things I invoke.

161
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,340
Let me just do one thing.

162
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,410
Whenever there is a.

163
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,080
This thing.

164
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,400
Let me.

165
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,560
Do this part.

166
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,220
What I'm going to do is.

167
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,740
System.

168
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,970
Dot dot thought Ritalin.

169
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,670
Nyquist.

170
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,480
So this can be printed.

171
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,380
Sorry, we cannot print a request here.

172
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,290
If you want to do, you can print the request also.

173
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,630
But before that, we need to create a string framework here because it's not a string.

174
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,160
First, we need to make a string here.

175
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,720
So what I'm going to do is step response here now.

176
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,600
So response.

177
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:42,270
Then inside this response, I'm going to mention when it's a string framework string.

178
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,890
Use this string only not a small string because we are going to handle the string handling methods.

179
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,200
Also HTTP response only and engineer response is equal to.

180
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,950
What I'm going to do is client.

181
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,040
This is client send.

182
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,770
Now I want to mention the HTTP response.

183
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,230
So first is basically request.

184
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:19,470
So this is basically we can say we are working with client request and this model in the spring framework

185
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,600
only SGP.

186
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,580
Or for this purpose.

187
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,130
What is the thing is HTTP response only.

188
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,120
GDP response.

189
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,120
Don't body handlers.

190
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,860
Then again, the of.

191
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,900
Bring.

192
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,320
Okay.

193
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,070
So.

194
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,560
What I need to mention is here is basically.

195
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,620
Response.

196
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,130
Body handlers of spring.

197
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,860
Spring, not spring saw the strains.

198
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,140
Let me do this again.

199
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:25,940
So.

200
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,390
So it is telling me to.

201
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,690
So our example is not throws exception.

202
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,240
That's a.

203
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,450
Year.

204
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,780
Are you exception?

205
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,570
And interrupted exception I need to mention here.

206
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,630
Because we are going to face that exception also.

207
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,610
Oh, so this is it.

208
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,390
We are going to do this.

209
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,240
So let me do one thing.

210
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,340
Let me invoke.

211
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,620
This.

212
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,060
Directly.

213
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,760
So what the missing thing is, I'm specifying this so this can be generated.

214
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,780
Or sometimes I mention this request with this and what I can do, I can print your this.

215
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,010
Okay.

216
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,660
So in loco with this application what I can do.

217
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,240
I can run this application, so let us check it's running or not.

218
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,550
If there is an error, we are going to develop this and we are going to check that part.

219
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,410
So currently it's taking, it's running and each and everything it's doing is running and directories

220
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,990
also it is taking the part of that.

221
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,130
So it will take time to run each and everything.

222
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,440
Once this is done.

223
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,640
You can say this is the.

224
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,380
Thing which is renewed in future.

225
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,580
But our spring boot is doing very well.

226
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,270
None I can see.

227
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,290
Change this.

228
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,990
This started with application.

229
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,070
GBM is running now.

230
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,200
So this is over.

231
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:03,290
Basically the application is running, it is creating stability engine.

232
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,820
Everything is running and spring is working very well.

233
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,560
Springwood.

234
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,240
So this is basically warning.

235
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,590
You can check.

236
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,490
And as I told you, I'm just printing this part only.

237
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,200
So it will print the info part.

238
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,000
We stop this.

239
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,140
So our response team is working very well.

240
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,980
So I will remove this in later part.

241
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,470
Let me create one thing or let me add one dependency injection here.

242
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,820
So our dependency injection is nothing but when.

243
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,930
What we can see.

244
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,910
Comms failure.

245
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,610
So let me copy it from web.

246
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,540
Uh, let me go to the.

247
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:55,750
Okay.

248
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,640
Do not open nearly to check on me only.

249
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,440
So let me go to the project here.

250
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,630
Let me go to the XML.

251
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,930
So I need to mention one spring dependency.

252
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:16,380
So I will add it here, which is basically a CSP and which is basically the for the common thing here.

253
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,150
So you can check here.

254
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,040
Injection.

255
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,230
So let me load this part.

256
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,050
So it is resolving our dependencies.

257
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,900
And if the dependency found, it will download that.

258
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:36,340
So this is the basic thing of what we can say, checking each and everything.

259
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,920
So this is the dependency injection here.

260
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,800
So as you can see, our dependency now injected variable, which is basically a dot coms.

261
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:54,000
So what is the basic thing I'm using here is while printing the data, I don't want to mention it as

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
a comma separated.

263
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,730
I need to mention it says handling the request.

264
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,940
And so I invoke that part.

265
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,360
So later I will explain how this is going to work.

266
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,890
So for other things, I'm going to check this part also.

267
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:19,830
Let me add two or three things more here, because due to time constraint, I don't want to specify

268
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,880
much more time in that you can use directly these things.

269
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:34,870
Also let me mention that part first and it's very useful, but it is basically KSP part nothing more,

270
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,250
which is basically string reader.

271
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,970
I'm going to use it later because.

272
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,290
And.

273
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,030
You can import Java or your dot star.

274
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,660
Star then is also.

275
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,890
Start.

276
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,220
So useful thing is in Java is you can import all the libraries.

277
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,460
Let me make a change here is importing.

278
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,510
So you can check.

279
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,750
I'm importing the libraries.

280
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,270
These are the some system default libraries here.

281
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,890
And let me add one more thing is basically passing the thing with string reader, which is basically

282
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:18,490
terrible.

283
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,330
Iterable is nothing but checking this again and again.

284
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:22,870
So.

285
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,150
Again what is the thing is basically pretend to.

286
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,480
So all.

287
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,530
I'm going to pretend again.

288
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,480
So it will create glass in each and everything.

289
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,510
Let me do that, Slater.

290
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:49,290
So it will import this and this is we already done it from dot XML and I'm mentioning a default in here

291
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,600
or you can check the documentation of comps on the Internet.

292
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,000
But commerce is nothing but it will check all the headers files.

293
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,680
So as in this GitHub file or we can say raw data file, GitHub data file, there are already errors.

294
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,650
In further part, I'm going to mention a HTML page also and we are going to depend that part and we

295
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,990
need to store the some locations also in our system.

296
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,110
So I will tell you how we are going to do that.
