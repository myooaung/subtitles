WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.140
We have already set up our project for Java Servlet.

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.500
Now we will learn what is Java Servlet.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.570
But before that I will summarize the first part, what we learned first.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.190
So in IDE, what I did, I just created Java.

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.870
We project with End and we just build that project using the last server.

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.160
So that's it.

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.210
Setup is done.

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.620
Now what we can do, we will learn about some Java servlet.

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.570
So what we can say servlet is a Java technology to create web application.

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.680
So so servlet in Java are basically dedicated for creating web application.

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.410
So difference between web page or web application, I will tell you in the folder, but in short, I

12
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.740
can tell you web application is for performing a single task like we are now.

13
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.410
Our task is over creating event registration portal.

14
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.110
So this is the web application web pages for marketing and everything about that particular company,

15
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.700
university or anything organization.

16
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.240
But web application is particular for that purpose.

17
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.970
So servlet is an API.

18
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:22.060
So servlet is known as API and it is using the API basically so it can use to create APIs to provide

19
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.600
many interfaces, classes including documentation and everything.

20
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.780
So, so are very powerful to create API.

21
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.820
So if you know what is API, API is basically application programming interface.

22
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.140
So if you want to create some interface, application programming will be used there.

23
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.040
So similarly, like that API gives you the.

24
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.190
Application interface with interfaces, classes and documentation, everything.

25
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.860
So servlet will consist two things interfaces and classes.

26
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.990
But while we're doing that, you will understand what is the difference between that interfaces and

27
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.630
classes.

28
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.800
Both are looking similar, but both are very different concepts.

29
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.900
So let us see first what is servlet?

30
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.780
In interfaces.

31
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.390
So is an interface that must be implemented by creating any servlet.

32
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.720
So as the name suggests, interface it should.

33
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.080
So some application or interface.

34
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.780
Also.

35
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:37.540
The class also is a class that can extend the capabilities of servers and responds to incoming requests

36
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.880
like how the web page is working.

37
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.220
Use client or we are searching something on Google.

38
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.190
So if you are searching something on Google, we send the request for that request.

39
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.140
The server which is located in on the internet like from you send some search on google something about

40
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.830
KAB and you want this is the request sent something some information for car.

41
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.640
In that response, the Google server will send the response for you.

42
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.680
It will send a respond for that request.

43
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.470
So basically.

44
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.850
So it works like that.

45
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.510
Response and respond requests.

46
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.890
So Sublet is a web component that deployed on the server to create dynamic web pages.

47
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.310
Now the dynamic web page means you can change everything inside that static web pages are something

48
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.560
like static.

49
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.650
You cannot change it.

50
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:38.220
These are some informative web pages like company wants to know that they're all information home,

51
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.460
then some about us.

52
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.400
And that's it for giving information in dynamic web pages like the event portal.

53
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.340
Or you can say my one website is dynamic, you can search there, they can add something on that.

54
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.890
So this is known as dynamic web pages.

55
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.040
So Servlet are basically used to create dynamic web pages.

56
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.150
And Servlet are web component that deployed on the server.

57
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.130
That's why we need server here.

58
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.770
Otherwise we can use only HTML and web browser and we can create but nothing like that.

59
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.740
We need one server, so we created one localhost.

60
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.540
As I told you, we downloaded the server to deploy our servlet.

61
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.230
So this is all about the servlet introduction.

62
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.520
It is just a basic.

63
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.710
So first, what we know that servlet is technology to create a web application.

64
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.940
Servlet is API that provides interfaces and classes.

65
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.530
So servlet works as both interfaces and classes interfaces to implement that UI user interface and everything.

66
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.180
And a class it serves as class to extend their capabilities like, you know, the, the Java thing,

67
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.260
if you want to implement logic in HTML, you cannot implement logically.

68
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.400
You cannot add something to numbers, you cannot proceed with some logical expressions there in HTML,

69
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.130
CSS, you need the back end.

70
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:08.080
So Java will provide this back end in industry java python as well as JavaScript used use servlet.

71
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.420
But servlet is very important because it deployed on the server end, not on the user end.

72
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.450
So that's because it will create dynamic pages.

73
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.690
So let us see how it will work to the diagram.

74
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.320
So this is the client.

75
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.140
This is our client.

76
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.640
Or we can say our machine.

77
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.370
This server.

78
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.540
So client will ask for a request or send request.

79
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.880
That's how the network works, basically.

80
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.150
So client, which means our system or we are using that system, we are searching our mobile phones,

81
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.300
anything on which is available on internet.

82
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.770
So client, if I am searching google.com on the internet, the google.com request sent to the server.

83
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.550
Know what it will be do.

84
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.550
Server doesn't have any application or something like that.

85
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.730
It will search everything.

86
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.950
There are some pre-built applications based on Java, JavaScript, anything.

87
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.210
So server will generate or take time to response.

88
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.490
So response is generated at runtime.

89
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.790
From that data.

90
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.720
Here is the data.

91
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.660
I can say this is the database and that response is sent to the client.

92
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.280
That's how the whole network works in servlet and request based on request and responses.

93
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.360
So now let's see our project based like what is the important thing in our project?

94
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.140
So for the frontend part is HTML, CSS and JSX is used.

95
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.540
I'm not using JS here for this project.

96
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.850
I'm going to use HTML and CSS.

97
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.470
So you should know the prior prior knowledge about html.

98
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.070
CSS is not very deep but very.

99
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.530
Basic knowledge about HTML and services.

100
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.540
You should know Java servlet or we can say Java programs basically.

101
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.610
What is the classes?

102
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.430
What is the methods?

103
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.690
What is how?

104
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:05.350
We can easily syntax between them then data handling in Java like data types in Java.

105
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.920
So second part is Java servlet, which is the main back end part, which contains logical methods and

106
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.670
everything.

107
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.600
So you can see these are both are different.

108
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.210
So we need one link between HTML and C is also the HTML and Java.

109
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:30.250
So what I can more what I will give the example like in the train.

110
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:39.270
There is an engine and there are some other compartments also in the train, like other cabins and everything.

111
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.770
So to connect engine and other that cabinets and everything, we need the link.

112
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.230
Similarly HTML and java for that particular image html page.

113
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.400
There should be a java like if html pesos.

114
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.450
Take two inputs from user number inputs and print ads.

115
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.270
There some result.

116
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.460
This is the basic application.

117
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.110
So I want to handle this.

118
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:13.140
So how the estimate will tell that this HTML file takes this number and it should give that to the that

119
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.260
java and it will take the addition and everything.

120
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.810
For that purpose we need a web XML.

121
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:25.710
So what I can say web XML is a control for low web control for flow for that web.

122
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.400
It's linking particular servlet to the specific web pages.

123
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:37.440
So servlet project contains three important parts each HTML, CSS or JS for frontend or anything related

124
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.660
to web deployment.

125
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.500
Second is Java solid programs, which are basically backends.

126
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:52.700
And also we required WebEx email or WebEx email is for like for.

127
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.620
What I can say.

128
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.330
Very simple.

129
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.420
As I told you.

130
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.300
It's for linking that particular part.

131
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.060
So these are about the Soviet important parts.

132
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:17.420
So let us see what is the thing in servlet before that I will want I want to truly go from for the web

133
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.320
application also.

134
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.100
So web application is application accessible from the web?

135
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.060
As you can see, there are several options on mobile.

136
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.420
You have WhatsApp, every thing.

137
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.860
So similarly on web, there are some applications created nowadays.

138
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:40.910
You are mostly seeing websites are basically web applications based on Java, servlet based on Java,

139
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.290
script, Python and everything like Amazon Web sites is itself a.

140
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.960
Oh.

141
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.310
Web application.

142
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:57.290
So web application composed of web components like servlet, JSP filters and other elements HTML, CSS,

143
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.820
JavaScript, everything.

144
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.370
JSP is basically Java servlet pages.

145
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.130
We are going to see further what is the difference between Java servlet programs and JSP programs?

146
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:12.580
So the components typically execute in web server and response the HTTP request.

147
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.460
So basically web application works like that.

148
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:24.840
Now what is the difference between CGI, the normal request and responses and our Java subject?

149
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.110
So let us discuss what is CGI.

150
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.390
CGI is basically.

151
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.060
Com one gateway interface.

152
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.310
So let me go with the project.

153
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:46.650
I will show the first part of our project, then I will tell you mostly about this CGI and everything.

154
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.920
So let us see how we can proceed with our project.

155
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:58.890
So as you can see, this is our project and I created index or HTML first like it's default created

156
00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.330
there.

157
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.660
So that's it about index or html.

158
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.830
But what is over first pages I'm going to create is.

159
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.520
Is a log in pitch.

160
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.050
So if you know the syntax of HTML, you will understand this.

161
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.300
This is for just commenting out.

162
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.830
Log in html.

163
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:21.460
I will.

164
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.830
Or create there.

165
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:32.420
Then I'm going to use one default CSS, I can say, which I already created and I'm going to use that

166
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.200
CSS CSS file to link all the things.

167
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:46.590
So if you want, you can directly use some other CSS file to provide better environment, or I can say

168
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.560
better printing for your project.

169
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:56.670
So I as you can see, I am using I am using when going to use this this CSS file.

170
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.800
You can directly use this also.

171
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.900
It is available on internet and you can use it easily use this.

172
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.480
So this is basic CSS with some HTML, H1, common and everything.

173
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.730
So let us see how we can link this.

174
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.040
So this is in HTML in the title.

175
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.930
I'm going to give the login page.

176
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.460
You can do the similar things.

177
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.250
This is all about our index, not estimate.

178
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.350
I just use this default size.

179
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.390
So individual testimony is over front page icons here.

180
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.560
I used your total CSS to create CSS.

181
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.010
So I will tell you what is the significance of each tag here?

182
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.260
So this is for linking the our CSS total CSS.

183
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:51.050
I'm going to use only single case file to give the UI nice for our project.

184
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.080
Then this is linked to you.

185
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.090
The one there I'm using sense.

186
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.110
Open sense here.

187
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.560
Then this is more queue for the.

188
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.960
Please choose the below links to log in your account.

189
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.640
Something like that on the web pages.

190
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.330
That's scrolling.

191
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.870
But the important part here is I added two images.

192
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:22.760
Also remember for the admin PNG for admin image or admin logo just and for the part png for participant

193
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.390
image here.

194
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.730
So here what I created, I'm going to create to another HTML files.

195
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:34.500
This is all about front end, basically a log in HTML which is for admin login.

196
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:40.710
And that admin log login page will attach to another Java servlet to create that logic.

197
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:46.260
We will see in the further part also that but before that I created this admin login.

198
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.450
Similarly for participant logging.

199
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.700
So that's it about the index attachment.

200
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.330
So what you need to create, you need you are going to create two links there.

201
00:13:54.330 --> 00:14:03.000
You can put links also there, but I am representing it as a button for simple scenario.

202
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.930
As you can see, I created button and I'm going to attach that.

203
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.540
It will be looking very good for us also.

204
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.000
So let us deploy this.

205
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.790
As I told you, for the deployment, simple steps.

206
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.180
You can right click there and you can.

207
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.280
Let's clean and build.

208
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.930
Now in the output below.

209
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.850
There you can see it is clean and doing all the stuff built successfully.

210
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.270
You can see now let's do this.

211
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.880
It will starting glass server.

212
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.770
So we need a glass server.

213
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.720
Without this we cannot deploy anything.

214
00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.160
It will take time to glue with bootstrap and everything.

215
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.580
But.

216
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:56.030
So this is all about java solid and this is basic.

217
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.970
So always remember don't change indexed HTML to another file.

218
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:05.640
What it will be create it will create some anomaly in this dot a starting page.

219
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.460
So it will proceed with that further.

220
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:17.280
So now you can see it is creating and it is deploying over this web page on the server, as you can

221
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.630
see, successfully deployed.

222
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.870
Now, I will show you that Web page also.

223
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.500
So this is our Web page we just created.

224
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.150
So as you can see, it is localhost only event registration project.

225
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:41.270
And these images I am loading through the CSS by default on the internet available on the Internet,

226
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.760
you can change as you want.

227
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:50.870
And this is all about our admin log in and participant logging as this is very basic I can see and this

228
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.600
is indexed dot html I'm creating.

229
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.180
So as you can see login page you can see here and everything.

230
00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.970
So what I am going to show you is when I created this admin login.

231
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:10.440
You can see status for zero four is not that is not fun because I haven't created any admin.

232
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:21.000
What I can say is HTML file or web pages are similarly for participants logging in for other videos.

233
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.840
I'm going to tell you how we can create admin, log in and each page and how we can attach to the Java

234
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.410
servlet.

235
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.740
So this is all about the beginning or setup of our part two for our setup and everything.

236
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.690
So this is the landing page, opening page of all of our portal.

237
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:44.650
So as I can told you about that, this is our web page or I can say web application here.
