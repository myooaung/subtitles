1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,320
So here is the add customer java file, which is also defined inside the package airline.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,960
So we have imported here the necessary packages which we will use inside this class.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,190
So we have.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,240

157
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:05,020
Execute a date query here see dot as dot execute update inside which we have passed the string string

158
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:11,500
and then we have showed the dialog box as customer added and set the visibility of the current window

159
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,370
as false.

160
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,520
So after the successfully addition of the customer, the window will be set as false.

161
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:26,530
Catch block will handle any exception focus setting the size of the current frame as 900, cross 600.

162
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,460
Setting the visibility of the frame as true.

163
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,570
Setting the location of the frame as 400 plus 200.

164
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,420
Inside the main method we have just initialized that customer call the add.

165
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,420
This will just call that customer constructor inside which we have defined all the functionalities of

166
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,900
that.

167
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,760
So this is about the customer class of this project.

168
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,570
So.

169
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,170
Let me show you how it will look like when we will run this.

170
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,270
So I will be showing you from the login page.

171
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,760
Let's run the login page.

172
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,700
I will be writing the information.

173
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,440
And then.

174
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,200
Plus there's one, two, three, four, five.

175
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,100
Let's look.

176
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,150
Here.

177
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,250
This is the main fan base.

178
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,150
The previous one was for vlogging class.

179
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,790
This was for the main frame class.

180
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,360
And inside the alarm system, click on add customer details.

181
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,230
Now this base is the output of the ADD customer.

182
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,570
Plus here we can write the details and select male or female.

183
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,000
Phone number and click on Save.

184
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,440
So we'll be closing it.

185
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,180
That's how it will look like when we will run the ad customer class.
