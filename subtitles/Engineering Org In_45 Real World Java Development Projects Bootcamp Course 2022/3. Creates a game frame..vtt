1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:09.480
This next part we have to do here we have the three labels which store, which store the image of the

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.980
preferences so that no user mouse hovers on these images border.

3
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.850
Or we will say, yeah, the border color changes, the white part will hover there.

4
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.340
So what we will do firstly, let's run this file first and.

5
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.590
Okay.

6
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.210
So here we got this thing here for what I have done.

7
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.190
This output is coming in the center of the window.

8
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.150
I have tried the distant set location relative to the property, and here we have done this thing.

9
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.110
So because of that, the output is going in center of the window.

10
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.990
So now what we have to do, firstly, we have to create a border first.

11
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.410
So here we will write, create orders here.

12
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:21.840
We will lie in order to stop Raven So Neiman has grey border when it comes to border factory dot create

13
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.320
will take a mad border.

14
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.840
You don't mind?

15
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.910
So Henry will take this one and give to one?

16
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.460
No, I will set it to.

17
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.850
To en route, obviously to.

18
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.010
Similar to height also to the color will be.

19
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.870
Something with that.

20
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.930
Okay.

21
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.850
Sorry.

22
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.300
This one.

23
00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.920
Okay.

24
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.220
Say hello to.

25
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.500
Not clean.

26
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.800
Stick to the plan.

27
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.210
Okay.

28
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:18.530
I have the I was wearing this one to try to the black for first.

29
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.840
This is done.

30
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.900
Okay.

31
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.420
Now under water.

32
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.590
We will need we will take it as the green.

33
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:41.020
So water green water equal to water factory not create mud one.

34
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.860
Here.

35
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:57.950
So to do this one seems to do this is also to add color said to the screen.

36
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.640
So it's done.

37
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.730
We have created the waters.

38
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.600
Now we have to set the borders under this constructor.

39
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.390
So here we will write set borders first and we will write label.

40
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.500
We have to name you this one side, the border.

41
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.210
And we have the border.

42
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:43.500

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.920
No, we need our rock, paper, scissors label.

46
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.100
So here we will write all.

47
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.720
People thought said border and surged to green border.

48
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.450
Here we will take it as a green border and relabel.

49
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.230
Julie and then when the rock Dodd said border.

50
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.260
And so took the green one.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.110
Don't know.

52
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.750

61
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.590
This part is done.

62
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.040
And now what you have to do.

63
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.460
We will run our program first.

64
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.680
Chuck Fritz.

65
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.100
Yeah.

66
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.180
This one is green here.

67
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.150
The black one.

68
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.790
GREENE okay.

69
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.170
So what do you think?

70
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.570
I have to change it.

71
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.810
GREENE.

72
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.420
GREENE okay.

73
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:27.690
Okay.

74
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.280
Let it be green here.

75
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.470
Green.

76
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.730
Okay.

77
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.650
Now, these labels have the ringtones also mouse.

78
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.370
And we need the mouse click or enter this one.

79
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.690
The mouse clicked, the mouse entered and the mouse exited.

80
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.520
We have these three even.

81
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.030
Firstly, what I have take I will take of these each of these three to mouse click clicked event.

82
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.140
Solidarity.

83
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.660
Here we have the mouse click even now.

84
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.180
What do we have to do?

85
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.990
We need the Rock One Mouse Click event.

86
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.430
Here we will display the image or the image we have here.

87
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.630
Okay.

88
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:31.630
So here we will write our part of displaying the rock image first.

89
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.630
Same goes with this one here.

90
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.160
We will drive this thing before we reach.

91
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.150
Same goes with this.

92
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.850
Displaying the scissor image.

93
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.390
So now for the.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.780
Okay.

95
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.700
So we have an agreement.

96
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.100
Also, the mouse enters one and the mouse enter.

97
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:14.300
We have to change the border with the black to the green when no user holds the mouse.

98
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.410
So here we will write change order.

99
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.180
So what?

100
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.130
We will write Chile and we need the rock.

101
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.020
I'm not set.

102
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.710
Said Border.

103
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.600
Door.

104
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.600
Green one.

105
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:43.330
It doesn't seem that this change moderate

106
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.700
and even dry chili bowl.

107
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.860
This one is for people.

108
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.540
Right.

109
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.770
So take the paper and write site border.

110
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:04.430
Dart site border and central to Greenville.

111
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.030
See here.

112
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.190
Key.

113
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.490
Okay.

114
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.830
Not Greenland.

115
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.690
Sorry.

116
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.570
We like to hear the same thing.

117
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.540
Change water.

118
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.530
Key.

119
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.750
Means more than making cheap labor.

120
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.140
We need the Caesar part here.

121
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.220
So God sent order.

122
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.200
Key.

123
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.090
The green.

124
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:08.570
Now, when the mouse entered and then the user mouse when the user released the mouse button saw border

125
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.440
will come back to the initial color.

126
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.910
So we have to right here, same thing really.

127
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.400
And what we have in the initial color, we have the black one, right?

128
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.780
So here we will.

129
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:29.420
Right, set the border and put it to the black border.

130
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:37.310
And same thing goes with all of each of these buttons.

131
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:46.880
So in each of these we have done the change border event here.

132
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.450
Okay.

133
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.230
So here.

134
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.570
Same thing we have to write in border.

135
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.650
Change murder.

136
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:17.320
We have to rock, not set Mordor and set it to black, obviously.

137
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.100
And same thing here.

138
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:28.260
Believe me, we need the people on board.

139
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.100
That board.

140
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:30.790
Of course.

141
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.740
On Black Sea.

142
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.730
We will run our file first and see the output.

143
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.180
He had been.

144
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:47.810
Okay.

145
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:55.970
See this effect or that when I'm going with the cursor here, it changed to the green and when I'm releasing

146
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.940
the cursor it changed over to the initial one.

147
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.410
So this part is done.

148
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.780
Now we have to make another.
