1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:07,870
So previously we have seen we have a few new variables for the enemies.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,070
And here I have the IndyMac's enemy health.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,660
Now, what happened next thing?

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:22,090
Now, every time we go on an attack or going to combat with an enemy, it's going to randomly generate

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,220
the amount of health they have.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,070
This is going to be the maximum amount of health they can possibly have.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,070
So the number is going to be from zero to this number here.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,950
And I'm going to go ahead and set this to be let it.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,940
I think let's set it to 70.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,940
But again, you can play around with it.

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:53,320
You can set these to pretty much any numbers you want so you can see how it works and when you change

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,620
them.

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,360
The next thing we need is the attack damage for the enemy.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,910
We need to know the maximum attack damage or the maximum amount of damage an enemy could do to our character

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,080
when we are going.

16
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,550
So let's go ahead and call this enemy attack damage.

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,630
So here the next variable I have in.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,310
Enemy attack damage.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,210
And I will set it to the, let's say, 30.

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,490
And for example, we don't want our character dying too quickly.

21
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,340
So now that we have set up the enemies, we can go ahead and see player variables.

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,780
So we are going to stop some player variables here.

23
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:54,390
So the next thing I will go ahead and start with the command here and leave that to player variable

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,810
here.

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:00,390
And so here, first of all, we will have the health of our character.

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,890
So here I will write in health and I will set it to 100.

27
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,380
So you can use whatever values you like.

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,680
And we can set our players attack damage.

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,170
How much damage we can do to enemies.

30
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:27,470
So we can go ahead and to our guide to more damage to the enemies they can do to us.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,920
Then we will go ahead.

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,660
And so here I will write.

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,980
The next one is the attack damage here.

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,010
And I will set it to.

35
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:50,160
25 years and the next two more variables we want and we want to keep fighting as long as possible.

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,730
So for that, we want our person to be able to heal up.

37
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:02,500
We are going to make something which we need is the health potion, the health potion, the mechanic.

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,270
We are going to make it so.

39
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:11,260
Our enemies are going to make it our character and can then have a health potion.

40
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:19,810
If he or she learn health and he or she, the player, can go and can get some more health aesthetics

41
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,700
and for that.

42
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:31,540
So we are going to go ahead and right here in num name it as the health potions here.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:40,450
And this is going to be the number of health potions that are that our character starts out with.

44
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,280
So this is the health our player starts with.

45
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,030
So this is attack damage of our player.

46
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,140
And so the next thing is the amount of the health potion.

47
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,250
So here I will set it to.

48
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:08,740
Let's save for and next thing which we need the amount of health potion that our player will start with.

49
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:15,010
You can go ahead and add comments to the side of each of these.

50
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,620
So here I will write.

51
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,080
The next one is we need.

52
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:30,300
Health ocean he amount 30 to 30 year.

53
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:44,710
Ann helped push and set it to drop chance here and just put it with the 50.

54
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,540
And here it will be.

55
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,430
The other player will start.

56
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:57,250
And you can go ahead and I will add the comment here of tip percentage so it can easily remember which

57
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,160
ones they are.

58
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,920
So we need two more variables for these, the health question here.

59
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:10,690
So these are the other variables that actually give some static so to them, so we can say integer health,

60
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,150
ocean amount.

61
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,290
So this will be the amount of health the portion heals.

62
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:26,370
So for go, I have created and set it to the 30 and we can have one final integer health portion drop

63
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,920
chance.

64
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:35,470
And here I set it to the 50 and we are going to make a and so every time you kill an enemy, there is

65
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,150
a certain percentage chance for them to drop a health potion.

66
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,680
And I'm going to go ahead.

67
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:51,520
And here I had set it to the 50% and I will just add a command and see here the percentage because it

68
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,260
may not be obvious.

69
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,630
So the half, 50% means the chance to drop a health potion.

70
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,200
Or 50% not.

71
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,220
But again, play around with these numbers.

72
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,800
You can make them whatever you like.

73
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,960
This is going to work either way.

74
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,600
So now what we know, what we need is we need a boolean variable.

75
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,590
We are going to call this running.

76
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:26,100
The next variable, which we need is a boolean variable.

77
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:37,230
And this set it with the running name here and just write that to the true here.

78
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:46,530
And because not this running variable is going to be a part of a while loop, so it's going to be the

79
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,340
condition for a while loop.

80
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:57,030
So the game is going to keep iterating over and over until we tell it to stop or tell until some conditions

81
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,940
are met so that the game has to stop.

82
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:06,270
So we are going to go ahead and add our system, dot out.

83
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,740
And I will write.

84
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,330
System.

85
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,300
Not our friend Alan here.

86
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,020
And under this I will write.

87
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,430
Okay.

88
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,870
So here.

89
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,150
Here we are going to give a welcome message for the game.

90
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,180
So this means our game is start so we can see what we can say.

91
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:41,600
Welcome to the adventure game or the menu because the name of our game is Dungeon and this will be the

92
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,160
start of our game.

93
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,870
So here we are going to go ahead and say so.

94
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,630
Here firstly, we are going to say.

95
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,610
Guest.

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
Welcome.

97
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Through the Dungan.

98
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,740
And so here it will show the start of our game.

99
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:14,090
And the next thing which we need is the game label here.

100
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:22,700
And it will show that while running and now we need a wide loop where the whole game happens.

101
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,250
Before we go into the loop, we are going to add one thing here.

102
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,060
I had added this is the label.

103
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:39,710
We need this because I'm going to go her and here I have right to team and then the colon.

104
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,230
So what I have done we have.
