1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,180
Last class, but I trust our job right here.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,340
We set up the game, we create a board here on which we play the game.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,460
We created a status bar here.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,280
This one, the score is displayed in a label which is located at the bottom of the board.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:25,470
So here the variable board is called a new board, the reference ad board board star method.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,520
So the hair board is created and added to the container.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,950
The start method starts the Tetra scheme and here this will return the status bar and all the things

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,540
which we have created here.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,580
It should go with our game.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,890
So this was the Tetris game.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,280
Now we will see the output of it.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:58,500
So what we have to do now, so we will simply run our game and see here what I will press the p.

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:08,010
It should print the policy right now what I will do I will press the it should coming up coming down

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,930
c dee dee dee dee.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,650
It's coming down here coming, coming, coming.

16
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,320
One line down here which we have done.

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,430
Think so what?

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,700
The next thing which we have created, we have to go with the next one.

19
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,290
This is the right one.

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,760
This is the rotate left, rotate right, rotate left.

21
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,930
This is with the up and the down key.

22
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,970
I'm doing this.

23
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,900
The key pressed even of the keyboard.

24
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:47,380
So here, David, for the one line down here, this one, one line down here, this rotated.

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:55,180
And these are the one line down and this is space for the game over and the score is zero.

26
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:03,100
So here, this is our game, which we have created and it is called as the pointer game or the Tetris

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,390
game, which you can see.
