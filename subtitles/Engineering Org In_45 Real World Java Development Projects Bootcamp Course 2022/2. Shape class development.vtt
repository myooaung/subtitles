00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.680
We will go to the file menu and here we will create a new project by the Nintendo Animals game in Java.

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.050
Then click next and then finish.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.420
Now we will go into this article and here we will create our package by the new Commodore Get game.

4
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.110
And on this package we will create a new class named as Shape.

5
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.620
The ship class provides information about a Tetris piece or the Panamanian piece or whatever.

6
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.280
You can say anything.

7
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.200
So this class, firstly, we will write.

8
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.310
Protected and

9
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.690
terminal.

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.990
None of this we will write.

11
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.880
No ship on that ship.

12
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.710
Command line.

13
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.520
Ship.

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.750
And then coma.

15
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.320
Bishop Gomez worship.

16
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.990
L-shape come mirrored.

17
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.820
These are the types of the sheep, the titans and the whole seven better shape names.

18
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.270
And the sheep called No Sheep, this one.

19
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.910
These are the seven that sheep line.

20
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.340
Sheep, sheep's worship and sheep and the mirrored sheep.

21
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:57.560
So after this, we will go to the courts and create the code hole, the actual coordinates of a Tetris

22
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.190
piece.

23
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.930
But before that, we will create some variables here.

24
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.770
Right.

25
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.730
Private

26
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.160
terminal piece chip.

27
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.060
Which will need.

28
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.580
And another one.

29
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:32.520
We will write Private End Cards Studio and another studio is in.

30
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.160
Guards people.

31
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.230
I'm done.

32
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.380
So after this, we will provide a constructor also.

33
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.610
So here we will write public shape, parenthesis.

34
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.730
And into this, we write initial shape parenthesis.

35
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.110
And then so we.

36
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.950
No.

37
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.410
What we will do.

38
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.370
We will create this matter, too.

39
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.660
After this, we have to right under this matter now.

40
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.970
Firstly, we have we will create the codes which will hold the actual coordinates of a Tetris piece.

41
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.220
We will write codes.

42
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.880
Continued.

43
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.360
For coma to.

44
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.050
Hold on.

45
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.500
This one will do.

46
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.980
And afterwards, we will write the actual coordinates of the Tetris piece.

47
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.860
This one is the actual coordinates of the Tetris piece.

48
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.820
And after this, we will write the code.

49
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.070
Stable area holds all the possible coordinates for of the Tetris piece.

50
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.270
So here this will see how we do

51
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.710
got stable newent.

52
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.950
And here we need a 3D array.

53
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.380
So.

54
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.260
Here.

55
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.500
Now, here we will write all the possible coordinate values of the Tetris piece.

56
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.280
So we will raid

57
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.990
00000

58
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.100
common zero.

59
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.730
Coma.

60
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.870
Zero.

61
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.470
Coma.

62
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.730
Zero.

63
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.190
This will be the possible guardians value.

64
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.160
And similar to this we will also write.

65
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:21.050
Firstly, we will do the column and then here, not here, we will write parentheses and we will start

66
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.000
with the zero comma minus one.

67
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:35.460
Parentheses, curly brackets and then curly brackets, zero, comma, zero, curly bracket, comma,

68
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.900
curly bracket.

69
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.050
And then minus one, comma, zero.

70
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.810
Curly bracket, then curly bracket.

71
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.990
Then start with the minus one and one.

72
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.030
These are another possible coordinates, then comma.

73
00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:01.340
And after this, we need another similar kind of coordinates.

74
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:09.530
So we will write zero comma minus one comma, curly bracket.

75
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:23.810
Zero zero curly bracket, one common zero curly bracket under one star, one comma, one curly bracket.

76
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.970
Curly bracket and then comma.

77
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:42.590
And before this, we need all we have to do once again.

78
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.850
And then this will be the fourth one.

79
00:06:46.850 --> 00:07:00.220
So zero comma minus one comma zero common zero curly bracket close curly bracket open right zero common

80
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.070
one curly bracket close, curly bracket open.

81
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.440
And here we will do the zero, comma two and then curly bracket, close comma.

82
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.840
We need another one here.

83
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.230
We will.

84
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.980
Right.

85
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:23.950
Minus one comma, zero, curly bracket comma zero zero curly bracket comma curly bracket, one common

86
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.510
zero curly bracket.

87
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:34.910
And another one will be the zero, comma, one and then curly bracket, curly bracket and comma, and

88
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:43.490
another one will be zero, one, zero and there will be the one zero coordinate.

89
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:56.030
So another one will be the zero comma, one comma next thing will be one, comma, one and then comma

90
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:06.380
now another one will be curly bracket and start with the minus one comma minus one common bracket.

91
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:16.760
And then for zero comma minus one, sorry, minus one down bracket close then comma and then bracket

92
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:25.790
open the near zero zero bracket, close commas, zero, comma, one here this one and then comma.

93
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:38.490
And here we will write our last coordinate possibility will be one comma minus one close open.

94
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:45.740
And here we will write zero comma minus one comma.

95
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.320
Another one will be zero, comma, zero, this one and the last one will be zero, comma one.

96
00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:02.330
And this will be our closing semicolon here.

97
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.860
No words.

98
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.180
Okay.

99
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.420
So now what we will do now what we have done.

100
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:20.130
The covered table header area holds all the possible coordinate values of the Tetris piece.

101
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:25.120
This is a template from which all pieces take their coordinate values.

102
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.190
This one.

103
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.450
So.

104
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:39.930
After this, we will ride set sheep here.

105
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.710
We will provide that terminal.

106
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.220
Dart no shape.

107
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.630
Semicolon after this.

108
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.170
This will be another matter.

109
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.310
We will see.

110
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.630
And now we have to do one more thing here.

111
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.720
We put one rule to coordinate value.

112
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:17.560
So before that, what we will do, we will take the code in value from the code table into the code

113
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.250
area for this piece.

114
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:26.020
So the ordinary method like you will see here this.

115
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.690
What we will do.

116
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.670
Here.

117
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:45.260
We will speak another thing and take the for loop and write in a call to zero colon semicolon and then

118
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:54.110
I is less than equal to four and and then I plus plus.

119
00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:03.650
Now what we will do inside this loop, we will create another loop with intuitively equal to zero.

120
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.880
And then g here less than equal to two.

121
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.110
Only less than two.

122
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.910
Two and.

123
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.580
Three incremental the value.

124
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.140
So inside this four loop.

125
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:28.710
We have we put one of the core values from the code stable into the code area of a Tetris piece.

126
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:36.750
So the here area will create a ordinary matter, the uses of the ordinary method.

127
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.190
We know that in C++ and type is essentially an integer.

128
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:48.600
So unlike in C++, Java and AMS are full classes and the ordinary method returns a current portion of

129
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.850
the enum type in an object.

130
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.560
So here we will do code.

131
00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.410
I am here to equal two.

132
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.460
We need the code stable.

133
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.740
And under this we will right here.

134
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.930
Ordinary matter.

135
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.710
And that we will write.

136
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.330
I hear you would write the G.

137
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.840
And then semi-colon.

138
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.470
Now, here we have done the thing and we will create this matter.

139
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.660
Q.

140
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.770
We have to do one more thing here.

141
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.000
We?

142
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.680
This one done here is also done.

143
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.260
So what we have to do now.

144
00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:01.000
After this we will create the p shape and we will initialize it to the shape.
