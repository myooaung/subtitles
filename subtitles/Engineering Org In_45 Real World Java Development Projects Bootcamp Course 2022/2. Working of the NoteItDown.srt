00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,980
Hello, people.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:10,230
I hope that you all have been through the introduction part of our town application made in Java.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:18,720
So if you have went through the introduction part, you may get an insight of what is going to happen

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,420
in this loaded down application.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,640
So now let us understand the working of this application.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:34,620
I have already told you that we will make this application under Java, WP and string libraries and

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,430
packages.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,430
So let's see how they work.

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,380
Suppose in this application there is a frame.

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:54,240
So where this frame came from, it came from the library of Java where there is a class named J Frame.

11
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,320
So yes, this is the frame of this application.

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,690
I can minimise it.

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,770
I should do so.

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,370
Yes.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,860
This is the frame of the application.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,110
Now let us see what are the scene consists of?

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,990
So in the heading we have name of the application as noted down.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,170
So yes, motel down shows us that this is the title of our notepad application.

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,730
Or we can see that the notepad clone which we are building, are going to build in this project.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,760
So yes.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,750
It contains a file button and a button and a help button.

22
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,070
So see the options inside the file button.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:55,040
We have a new open save print and exit option in there that we have copy paste cut select on.

24
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,600
So if we want to edit the text, we can do it by copying and pasting it anywhere.

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,800
Cutting any part of the text and then testing it anywhere else.

26
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,750
Or just simply remove it.

27
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:14,580
And also it contains a selector feature so that we can select all the text and export it to wherever

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,010
we want with a single click.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,520
Also, it has a help option which contains the about of this notepad.

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,450
The other window which we have discussed in the introduction part.

31
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,060
So if I click in this about option.

32
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,760
Yes.

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,280
So this is the about page.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,810
The back window opens after clicking this button here.

35
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:45,720
So in the about option, we have the basic idea behind this application, like the name of the application

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:53,250
and what it does note it down is a word processing problem as we have already discussed and allows us

37
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,360
to text change the text of the computer like it has an introduction similarly to the open option also

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,970
so we can open any file from our system.

39
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,340
And that's what the introduction part about Pass is about.

40
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,750
But we can change the text in our competition or the existing file in our computer can be changed to

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,940
this note down application also.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,320
And of course, we can create any text document from scratch.

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,100
Also, this program enables us to create documents, as I already said.

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,600
So after clicking this button, this will be closed.

45
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,040
So yes, often.

46
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,200
So the about section I.

47
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,400
I hope your mouse must have got done and I doubt it.

48
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:51,210
Now let us try and write something like if we create a new right, so suppose.

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,410
Hello everyone.

50
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:05,670
Today we are going to learn Java.

51
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,860
So yes, I have typed some random text.

52
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,700
Hello everyone.

53
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,980
Today we are going to learn Java.

54
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,160
So if we select.

55
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,620
Yes.

56
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:28,550
So from day one, if we select the copy option as before selecting some so as everyone today and copying

57
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,040
it and then try to paste it here.

58
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,720
So, yes.

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,390
It's.

60
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,370
Excuse me, please.

61
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,790
Yes.

62
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,290
So if we try to.

63
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,620
Select some text.

64
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,980
Copy it and then try to paste it here.

65
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:54,830
So, yes, everyone today is copied from here and then pasted here so that adoption is working perfectly

66
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,250
fine.

67
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,900
Now, if you want to cut something, so we have to select it like we want to cut it down.

68
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,330
So we firstly we have to select this click on the cut.

69
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,750
So yes, it is cut.

70
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,550
Now if we want to paste this, suppose in the next line.

71
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,330
So yes, we have cut the part and now we want to paste it.

72
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,970
So yes, we have pasted it successfully in the next line.

73
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,430
Now the other option is select one.

74
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,640
So selecting one.

75
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,350
With the help of my mouse.

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,360
But now we will select all with the help of this shortcut.

77
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:43,540
So yes, you can see that after clicking the select all button that all all of the text in the notepad

78
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,500
is selected.

79
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,290
Now suppose we want to cut.

80
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,540
So, yes, everything is cut.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,460
Selector and cut.

82
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,270
So yes, they added water and its features are completely explained.

83
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Now let us move to the file option.

84
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,330
So yes, if you want to open any file from our system, we will click this open.

85
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,150
And yes, all your system files are open.

86
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,710
Now close it.

87
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,420
Yes.

88
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,660
So if you want to save any file, suppose you have to write.

89
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,510
Hello, everyone.

90
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,310
Okay, so if I want to save it, I will click on the save button and opens.

91
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,770
Yes.

92
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,450
So perfect.

93
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,170
I can save it at any random name at any place.

94
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,580
So in my documents folder or wherever you want it to be saved.

95
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,510
This is a beautiful linking of your system and this knotted down application that we are going to learn.

96
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,450
So if I click on say yes.

97
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,320
So it is it.

98
00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:00,350
So if you have a printer attached, you can also print this document and it will be printed in a page

99
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,030
or whatever you want it to.

100
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,000
So yes, print option works also fine.

101
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:14,850
Now that we have learned all the functions of this application, like creating a new opening up, saving

102
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,220
printing now and then.

103
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,790
We are going to exit this application.

104
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,170
So, yes.

105
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,960
If we click on the exit, we exit the program successfully.

106
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,140
Now, trying to run this again.

107
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:41,890
So yes, after exiting the program, we have returned to the program and trying to explore some more

108
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,870
features of this application.

109
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,160
So you can see that after every option, we have a shortcut attached.

110
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,810
Yes.

111
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:56,470
So we have a shortcut for creating a new file and open up the folders from our system.

112
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,830
Save them, bring them and exit.

113
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,300
So let us try to use a shortcut like suppose if.

114
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:14,320
Right, some random text and from your keyboard click control c and the text will be copied.

115
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,850
So yes, keyboard shortcuts also works fine here.

116
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,730
So if you copy this and now change the line and try to paste it.

117
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:32,150
So yes, from Control V, I am able to paste this text again and again.

118
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:41,600
So it's up to you how you want to write text with the help of keyboard shortcuts or directly from the

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,620
application may have link to the number.

120
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:55,130
Okay, so this is the working of this note down application and I hope you must be wondering how can

121
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,050
we make this application?

122
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:04,940
So we should start learning the code for this program and explore more about it.

123
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,350
One thing I also want to add that we can also open.

124
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,980
Soon print an escape by pressing a skips key on the keyboard.

125
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,590
They shortcuts also have a functions attached with them.

126
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,400
Let's suppose if I want to save it I will click on control s and yes.

127
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,050
So it opens up your system as well.

128
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,950
You want to save that?

129
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,250
Similarly, if I click control P Yes.

130
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,200
So if I click control p.

131
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,040
The print option pops up since all the shortcuts have a functions attached with them.

132
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:53,890
So in the next part we are going to make a new Java project, a project in our favorite compiler we

133
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:00,340
use to decode and try to write this code for program it down.

134
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,900
Thank you.

135
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,970
See you in the next part.
