1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,210
So in previous tutorial I told you how I created this part.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:14,410
And now what I'm going to tell you, I'm going to create here this part I already created.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,410
And in this JSP, JSP is just the front end.

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,350
So let us see how we can create this front end.

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,490
So let me mention some HTML here because it's page.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,390
So as you can see, ID will automatically move to that part.

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,100
Then let me create one style here.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,720
So I will copy this part and I will tell you what is the significance of this.

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,960
Because I'm mentioning this directly.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm not going with direct path here, which is to mention.

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm mentioning stylesheet here.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,690
Okay.

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,510
Now.

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,270
So this is my stylesheet.

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,440
If you want to add title here, let me add title bar.

16
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,340
Caitlyn Jenner, basically.

17
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,890
Show me.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,790
Right.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,020
Let's move to add.

20
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,900
So these are the colored thing I'm adding and this is just a stylesheet.

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,540
The main part starts after this.

22
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,430
So let us see what is the body I'm going to use here?

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:47,820
So let me add a body tag here, because all the things are inside only body part, not your anything

24
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,030
part.

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,440
So I'm just adding this part.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,140
Then I need one form.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:01,470
Then I needed a form to create a one post action to to field, then some carry forward field.

28
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,420
Everything I'm going to add here form.

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,530
So let me add some

30
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,530
clues, but let me add some more attributes here.

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,610
Form is basically contain contents action.

32
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,180
Male client.

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,560
Limited.

34
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,060
Post this post.

35
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,680
So ignore this mail line because it's showing me the typo error.

36
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:46,200
Then let me add some form actions here and I will tell you what is the form actions these teams here.

37
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,310
So I already created this part.

38
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,480
So I will tell you what is the significance of these actions.

39
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,100
So this is the same thing.

40
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,810
Or we can say styling part.

41
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,600
I will tell you there are some arrows also showing my client these things.

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,190
So I will tell you what is this thing?

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,710
So this email client and what I'm doing here is here is started speaking.

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,230
So I'm accessing the request dot attribute message part first so as my HP to bring the message here

45
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,030
or we can say putting the message here.

46
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:33,630
Now table is started inside the form tag first is email to put the email whom I want to send that email

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:40,230
part email to part then subject holding part that takes subject and placeholder.

48
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:49,220
So then I'm adding some text area to comma six for email body, then directed with some input type type

49
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,980
submit.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,320
And I mentioned here value.

51
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,420
So I will tell you what I'm going to do here.

52
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,660
So these are the all things of GSP.

53
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,620
As you can see, this tag is again GSP.

54
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,300
Time for printing message and creating some value of submit.

55
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,940
This part of it just basically I'm going to create one class inside this.

56
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,770
So these are the old things and I will tell you we are going to invoke in GSP class also and how I'm

57
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,810
accessing this part, I will tell you later.

58
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,540
But these are the all things I use here.

59
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,470
So this is it for the GSP part, and I'm accessing the button and I'm setting its value.

60
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,620
Value is basically just what method I'm going to use here.

61
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,740
It's the this mail client that OPI slash which is the use here operation go.

62
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,950
So I will tell you what is the significance of this in the later part.

63
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:49,170
But first let us see what is the basically functionally going inside created what what is the solid

64
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,830
part here.

65
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,600
So if you know front end and back end of the way pages.

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,430
So I'm creating your dynamic page.

67
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,450
It's not static, it's not showing only the information I had typed there.

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,590
I'm going to create some responsive thing here, like clicking on that go button.

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,090
It will send the mail and everything I'm going to use here.

70
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,240
So this is not only the static thing, I'm going to create some dynamic thing for that purpose.

71
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,960
I need to back it back in this just basic logic as estimated as having not exactly programming language,

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,170
these are some frontend languages or we can say scripting language or for the visualization part, these

73
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,290
are not exactly like they can not add some.

74
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,500
There are not mathematical symbols in that also.

75
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,030
So for that API part or for that purpose, I need a new language.

76
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,800
So here I'm using Java.

77
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,780
So what is the Java servlet java.

78
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,300
So it is technology to create web application.

79
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,200
So let's use an API which provides the interfaces and classes to connect the HTML and some backend service

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,270
or backend database, anything you can do.

81
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,740
So so it is an access both interface and classes.

82
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,220
So it is an interface must be implemented by creating any solid.

83
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,570
So you have to create the one servlet and according to that you need to create interface.

84
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:13,830
But servlet is also access class to having some capabilities of servers which responds for incoming

85
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,460
request.

86
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:20,910
So if you know how the servlet working or how the Internet's working, it's basically on request in

87
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,570
response.

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,760
When the client gives the response and it will give the response and everything requests.

89
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,070
So these are how the network works.

90
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,740
So, so links are important part in this.

91
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,800
Not only this object, there are different things also known like some Java scripting things, so and

92
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,190
so Python also is used for that purpose.

93
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,050
So these are the different things we can use.

94
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,730
So servlet is an web component that deploy on server to create and dynamic web page.

95
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:57,250
So here is the solid part actually how creates this is the client and this is the server part and for

96
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,670
this purpose it will request the server responsive generated and the runtime and connection to the client.

97
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,480
So how this works, actually it's depend on your server side.

98
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,360
So my server so program deploys on the server and client will receive only the GSP pages or in this

99
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:15,940
case.

100
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,580
So I'm deploying on the local server.

101
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,680
But if you want to deploy an online server, you can use anything, a cloud or anything you can use.

102
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,870
Then here request dispatcher in servlet.

103
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,430
So what is the request?

104
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,450
DISPATCHER Request.

105
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,990
DISPATCHER The interface provides a facility of dispatching any requests.

106
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,890
So basically if you want to check any link directly from the Java like you could submit button and do

107
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:47,440
you want to like you want to find some another page, you want to go to another page for that purpose.

108
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,900
We are using request dispatcher method here.

109
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,460
So we are using here two methods forward method include method.

110
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,640
So as I told you and that request method in.

111
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:09,450
Great attribute it just basically for that forward part also is my java is solid as you can see.

112
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,010
That's my main dependency.

113
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:20,130
So this is the forward method and forward is for forwarding that good and including that including the

114
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:20,880
same port.

115
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,620
Then let me tell you.

116
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,070
So that important part is HTML, CSS as frontend Java program as backend and web XML for the control

117
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,490
flow.

118
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,040
But here I'm using XML and web XML.

119
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,620
There are two different things here.

120
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,910
Com is for properties and web for the control flow for whole web.

121
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,040
So let me move to the ID now and let me create one client, which is basically male client.

122
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:53,000
So as you can see here, I am mentioning my client as male client.

123
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,940
Male client.

124
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,600
So let me complete this part.

125
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,280
Then what I'm going to do, go to this Java.

126
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,730
I'm going to create here one package.

127
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,410
So why I'm developing another packages because it's very important for us concepts.

128
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,410
You can create different packages and you can use that later.

129
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,720
So let me create one package here.

130
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:22,340
I'm mentioning as so in this mail package, I'm going to create one Java class name as male friend.

131
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,210
So this is it.

132
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:34,970
And it's not just what I'm going to do is I just want to invoke that or I just want to import that.

133
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,490
So far, the importing is very simple.

134
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,170
Just go to this.

135
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,430
Let me show you how I'm doing all this.

136
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:44,750
Okay.

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,210
So I am importing this.

138
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,650
Let me capitalize this.

139
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,680
Because everywhere I capitalized mean.

140
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,440
Let me.

141
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,250
Refactor here and rename here as.

142
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,490
Mean, see?

143
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,140
So what we're going to see now.

144
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,360
Okay.

145
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,200
Okay.

146
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,720
I create another thing here.

147
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,800
Get me delete this.

148
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,440
And the Queen would disappear because I changed the name.

149
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,140
Naming is very important here.

150
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,070
I just want to create male seat not male because it's client notes.

151
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,080
Misspelled that.

152
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,300
How can I make sure it is done?

153
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,840
Let me mention your mail.

154
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,480
Still not the mail sealed.

155
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,390
And later I am going to create that open method.

156
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,770
I will tell you what is the thing.

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,950
So this is it.

158
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
I'm going to do so before proceeding with this.

159
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:22,250
Let me add some XML file here, which is basically very useful dependency.

160
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,630
I'm going to add here.

161
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,790
So let me add one dependency.

162
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,140
Which is basically Java meal.

163
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,180
Dependency.

164
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,890
1417 version.

165
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,240
So let me tell you how I am going to do is go to any dependency in that part.

166
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,650
I'm going to this part.

167
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,260
Let me paste this.

168
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,210
So this is the main dependency.

169
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:59,110
You can check from the Internet and just hit this and it will resolving dependencies, it will dissolve

170
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,070
it automatically.

171
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,640
Then I'm going to add another dependency which is basically Java X GBE, which is basically for the

172
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,510
dependency purposes.

173
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,770
Let me add this and let me sing this again so it will sync the dependencies automatically.

174
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,390
So Java X mail is for the mail purpose for creating any mail application.

175
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:30,610
So instead of downloading library or we can see Java Jar files, I can deploy this and this is the latest

176
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:30,850
version.

177
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,590
You can directly download this.

178
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,990
So this is for mail.

179
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,220
And let me just.

180
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,040
These buildings are just.

181
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,950
And let us create some mail in part here.

182
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,210
So in the mail client, what I'm going to do is.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,650
Let me extend it to the.

184
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,710
Be solely part.

185
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,750
It needs to be solved.

186
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,820
So as you can see, just I added this and it will automatically let me do one thing, some good stuff.

187
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,110
So no worries about importing labels.

188
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,390
Oh again, I'm adding some annotations here.

189
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,010
So adding annotations is very useful while developing this.

190
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:41,540
In all Java a solid lot.

191
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,210
Annotations, dot stuff.

192
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,820
And what I'm going to add this here is web solid, not some simple web solid.

193
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,790
In this episode solid.

194
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,120
What I'm going to mention is here is this male.

195
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,510
See.

196
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,840
Even so, it will be helpful for me to.

197
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,350
Mention that this is a male client with Soviet.

198
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:24,510
So I'm going to create your one serial version, which is very crucial for creating any mailing part.

199
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,830
So private.

200
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,970
Again static.

201
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,610
I will tell you why it is static.

202
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,590
Final.

203
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,200
Or it should be long because I'm treating her seriously, but I genuinely.

204
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,150
She doesn't use it anymore.

205
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,580
And.

206
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,130
So I created this part.

207
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,290
Then create.

208
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,650
Let me create one public static.

209
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,830
Final.

210
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,440
And here is the part of Whoopi.

211
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,720
Go.

212
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,960
Is equal to.

213
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,250
I'm mentioning at the same.

214
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:24,010
So if you go to this park now, you can check your operation is now successful.

215
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,360
So let me go to the client again.

216
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,670
Then let me create one constructor here.

217
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,440
Let me mention.

218
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,860
He means it again.

219
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,930
This is my constructor, and I'm not imagining I'm adding the super here.

220
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,080
Super duper.

221
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,260
Create auto generated constructor.

222
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,690
This is just auto generated.

223
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,460
You can use old insert also you to create anything here.

224
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,640
You can see constructor.

225
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,830
So constructor already exists.

226
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:17,790
So you can create auto generated constructor or you can choose your constructor just to pass your everything

227
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,220
here, like HTTP and everything.

228
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,440
So hope you understand this part.

229
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,080
In further part, I'm going to create application with some dubious methods and everything.

230
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,790
Hope you understand this part.

231
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:35,650
And in further part I will tell you the JSP basics and SMTP V6 also, which is basically simple email

232
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,660
transport protocol.
