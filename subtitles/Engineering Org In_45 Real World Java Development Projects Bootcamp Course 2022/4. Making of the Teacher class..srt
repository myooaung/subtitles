1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:11,680
So in the previous video we have created a student constructor and passed the argument for ID name and

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,460
grades.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,660
Yes.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,530
So.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,580
We have passed the three variables and these are fees.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,840
These are for fees paid and total fees of the school.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:31,280
So, yes, if a student is admitted in the school, the fees paid by him or her is zero in the beginning

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,930
and the total fees is suppose one less 10,000.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,020
So yes.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:45,680
So this is not compulsory to add this keyword to fees paid and fees total as they are not passed as

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,790
an argument in this constructor.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:58,370
So but for the uniformity in the code, I am attaching this keyword to fees paid and fees total variables.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,720
So now we have to set the grade.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,640
And you must be wondering that what is a set?

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,990
So we have set and get method in java for updating a variable.

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:24,170
Suppose if a variable is changing continuously then firstly we have to set it to a value and then the

18
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,830
compiler will receive it after the execution with the help of get keyword.

19
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,370
So yes, setter and getter in Java are very crucial.

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,560
But updating variables.

21
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:48,670
So you must be wondering why we haven't got set and get for a set for ID and name so you know, name

22
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,970
and idea of a person or student whenever he is admitted to a school, never change it.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,180
It remains constant for the rest of his life.

24
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:07,450
Like if a student is admitted to the school, what name is registered in the school directory?

25
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,860
It will remain the same.

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,870
So we do not have to worry about setting the name and the ID.

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,300
But what about the grade?

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,260
And it remains the same for the rest of the life.

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,210
Think about it.

30
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,910
So the grades never remain the same.

31
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,670
It changes after every half yearly exam or the final exam.

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:41,130
Suppose if a student scored 100 like 90 out of 100 in an exam, it doesn't remain the same.

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,880
It is a very, very rare thing that the dates remain the same.

34
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,560
Great changes.

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:55,110
And so we need to set the grade after every for every student, every student has different dreams.

36
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:03,570
So for setting the grade for every student, we have to use this dot for every student and.

37
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,780
For ID we have called this function public in get ID.

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,430
ID does not need to be set, it just needs to be get.

39
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,490
And this function returns the idea of a student.

40
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,510
Let me commend this out for your convenience.

41
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,320
Returns the ID ofa student.

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,850
And this part

43
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,660
set the updates.

44
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:49,070
The set method is used to update, so I'm using update grades of the student s.

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:59,340
Similarly for the name we created this function public string get name and this returns the name of

46
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:07,470
a specific student returns the name of the student.

47
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,700
So yes, we have.

48
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:25,060
Get your name and I.D. Now we have to get the grade of the student public and get grade.

49
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,820
We are using camel case for a better understanding of the code.

50
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,700
So you get a great.

51
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,250
This returns the grid.

52
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,310
So here we are.

53
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:57,710
We have a set target for all the variables declared in the above student class.

54
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:05,690
Now we will jump to the teacher class and make a teacher Java file.

55
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,920
In our SRT folder as well.

56
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,620
So naming this class as teacher or Java.

57
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,270
We have a class named teacher.

58
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,270
Now what a teacher can attain as a variable.

59
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,510
Think about it and then write with your own experience.

60
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,610
So yes, our teacher can have an ID, a name and a salary.

61
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:47,600
So initializing the variables as private access specified.

62
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,950
We have already discussed it about previous student section.

63
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,190
Private string funding.

64
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,260
Names are strings.

65
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,730
We know that private end salary.

66
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:13,730
So yes, if a teacher is here for teaching in the school, he or she must be expecting a salary.

67
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,660
Now in a similar manner.

68
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:26,480
In the student class, we will create a constructor named Teacher for the Teacher Class as well.

69
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:36,140
A constructor is an object we know with the same name as the class and contains arguments.

70
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:49,950
Basically it is a copy of the class we have made and where we can pass arguments of ID name and salary.

71
00:06:51,150 --> 00:07:01,980
So yes, calling all of the fields which we declared in the above class ID name

72
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,970
and salary, of course.

73
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,210
And salary is equal to salary.

74
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,800
Obviously, this is wrong spelling.

75
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,670
Yes.

76
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,820
So here we are.

77
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,200
We have created this new teacher object.

78
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,520
Let me comment this out for your convenience.

79
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,120
Creates this part.

80
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,420
Creates a new teacher object.

81
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,680
New teacher object?

82
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,660
Yes.

83
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,410
So here we have it.

84
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,340
For every teacher named for every teacher and a salary for every teacher.

85
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:02,380
Whenever we call it for a specific teacher, it will consist of ID name and salary.

86
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,970
So in the student section we have a freeze and a freeze total part.

87
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:18,500
So the freeze total part was supposed like one like 10,000 and the fees paid was zero in the beginning.

88
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:25,910
So similarly for teachers in the beginning, the salary earn should be declared.

89
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,020
So private end salary earn

90
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,660
is declared in the class.

91
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,270
And in the constructor, this not salary earned.

92
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,410
Is Z2 in the beginning.

93
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,140
Yes.

94
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,070
So.

95
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,940
After this.

96
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:59,750
After successful creation of object and class, we will use the get and set method as we previously

97
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,200
used in the student on Java file.

98
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,000
So let me give you a quick reminder about set and get.

99
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:16,700
So we have used as private as our access specified for this teacher class.

100
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:25,760
So for accessing this variable in the class, as we know, that private, private initialize variable

101
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,650
could not be accessed by any other class in this function.

102
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:40,640
So for and even for using it for the same function we use set and get methods so set and get provide

103
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,960
access and update of the value for a private variable.

104
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:55,250
If we need to access, we call this get and if we want to update the value of a private access specified

105
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,770
variable, we use set method.

106
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,180
So yes.

107
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,260
Similarly, as for the student Java file we will set.

108
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,780
The.

109
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,470
Salary?

110
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,750
Yes, salary.

111
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,590
So you must be wondering for the student.

112
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,540
We haven't set the ID and the name.

113
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,970
So similarly for the teachers, we will not set the IDs and the name as.

114
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:32,990
When a teacher joins the school, the ID ID is provided and which is safe to that dataset and remains

115
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,380
the same for the rest of the life and the name as well.

116
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,120
But the salary may increase in future if the school is impressed by a teacher's performance.

117
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:55,200
So yes, we will call, get and set for salary and later on we will initialize our function for ID and

118
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,670
which will return ID and name for that teacher.

119
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:11,190
So this public function contains the integer ID and this get ID function returns the idea of the teacher.

120
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,120
So let me commit this out for your convenience.

121
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:24,150
Returns the ID of our teacher.

122
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,760
So.

123
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,600
Yes.

124
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,220
The ID is returned here.

125
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,810
Similarly, we have to return the name.

126
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,590
So copying the above code and.

127
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,670
The name is a string, of course.

128
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,520
So writing it as name get a name.

129
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,990
A string.

130
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,380
And this is going to return the name of the teacher.

131
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,990
Yes.

132
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,420
It turns out the.

133
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,310
Name of the teacher.

134
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,850
Yes.

135
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,770
Now for the salary.

136
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:21,890
First we have to set the salary and then update it in case if it is needed.

137
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,100
So, yes, this is for the salary.

138
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,580
This returns the salary.

139
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,580
Typos.

140
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,120
Returns the salary of our teacher?

141
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,520
Yes.

142
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:57,430
So salary the teacher has her is declared as in now for setting the salary we have used public void

143
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,030
set salary in salary.

144
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,860
So yes, this is the snippet for setting something in Java.

145
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,800
Public void set salary.

146
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,210
And inside we have to declare the parameter what is need to be set.

147
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,950
So this part what it does.

148
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:30,010
Let me comment this out updates the salary of our teacher setting a salary, conveys updating it whenever

149
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,970
it changes, or which teacher it is being asked for.

150
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,710
Public void set salary in salary.

151
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,960
This salary is salary.

152
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,860
So yes, we have successfully set and get all the variables which were declared here.

153
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,390
So the first part of this teacher class is completed.

154
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,900
Congratulations.
