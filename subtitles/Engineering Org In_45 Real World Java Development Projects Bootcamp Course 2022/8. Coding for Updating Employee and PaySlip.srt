1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,440
So in this video, we will be talking about the last two classes of this project that is payroll system.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,380
So these two classes will be first is update employee and the second class will be payslip.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,110
So that slip will be for the salary purpose to show the record of that salary.

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:25,560
And after that, after this video, we will be having a look at the live run of this project.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,590
So let's have a look at the update employed class.

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,180
So in this class we have imported the Java SQL package to interact with the database update and record

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,610
update and retrieve the data from the database.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Java X Swing method will help us to create a graphical user interface for that current class and a blue

9
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,000
dot event will help us to handle.

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,430
Events on the buttons.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,920
After that we have defined our public class update employer, which is extending frame and implementing

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,540
action is not an item listener.

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,050
After that, we have defined J labels L1, L2, L, three, l47 labels and the label MP.

14
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,350
After that, we have defined seven text fields, two buttons and two choices.

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:18,240
Now we have defined our non parameterized constructor as a state employee and heading as a state employee.

16
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,770
After that, set the layout for that complete window or frame as null.

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,420
And after that, getting content paints the background color as white.

18
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,430
And C2 is close to a new choice.

19
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,440
We have created the instance for the C2.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,910
And see to what set bond will set its location and size, which is one 6040 and its size will be 200

21
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,900
cross 20.

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,930
Inside the try block, we will try to add the elements to our C two instance.

23
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,940
For that, we have created the connection variable.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,250
Our object of of our connection class and we have executed the query select abstract from employee with

25
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,700
the help of results set c dot as dot execute query.

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,520
Now we have iterated over the record of that employed table and added the idea of the every employee

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,940
in our choice and stance after that.

28
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,940
Inside the CAS block, we will handle any exception if occurs.

29
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:24,860
Now what we are doing is there is an AMP label which is stating select MP number and its setting its

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,660
bound and location and sizes.

31
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,630
Location is 40, comma, 40 and sizes in Red Cross 20 and adding that AMP label and C to choice both

32
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,580
to our frame.

33
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,540
Then we have defined the label as name and its respective text field of maximum size 15.

34
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,200
And then we have set the bound location and size for that respect to label and table t one.

35
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:52,370
And after that what we did is we have added both the label and text field to our frame.

36
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,410
Then we have defined a new choice for the gender that will be either male and female.

37
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,660
And the label for the label which contains then a string as gender.

38
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,560
After that there is a set the location and size for that label too.

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,510
And the choice one inside choice one.

40
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,940
What we are doing, we are setting its bound and location size for that particular choice.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,610
After that we are adding the label to and choice one to our frame.

42
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,430
Now there is a label three address.

43
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,270
For that.

44
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,930
We have a particular text field setting the location and size for that.

45
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,370
Label three and t three and adding that L three and t three label and text field respectively to our

46
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:36,880
frame.

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,920
Now in l four, which is a state as a state so that t four and there is a respective text field for

48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,860
it, which is a maximum size 15 for that state.

49
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,680
And then we have said the size and location of L four and P four, then adding that L four and three

50
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,420
four to our j frame.

51
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:57,780
After that.

52
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,720
What we are doing is there is a label five labeled as city and there is a text field five with maximum.

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,550
Text with the maximum number as 15.

54
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,630
And then we have set the size for that label 5.8 or text field of five.

55
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,260
And after that we have added both the labels and text field to our frame.

56
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,880
Similarly, there is another label for the email and its respect to text field.

57
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,400
And then we have set the bound for the email.

58
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,940
Contextually both, and adding that email and text file to our j frame.

59
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,730
After that there is a label phone and its respective text field and then we have set the bound for that

60
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:44,030
label L seven and seven and then respectively we have added that both the labels and text field to our

61
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,510
frame.

62
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:51,560
Then there is a button be one labeled as update and there's a button b two labeled as delete.

63
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,630
So but update button will be used to update the data and delete button will be used to delete the data

64
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,370
be one set bound.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,500
We have said the location for the button B one and b two respectively, adding both the buttons to our

66
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,150
frame.

67
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,340
Then we want to set background color is equals to black.

68
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,030
And B one point said foreground color is equal to white.

69
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,500
And similarly for the B2 we have added background and foreground color.

70
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,130
Added the action listener to both of the buttons.

71
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,870
Then we have added items for our choice.

72
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:29,160
C To now set the visibility of the current window as to its size will be 400 plus 550 and its location

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,910
will be 600.

74
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,050
Comma 200.

75
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,630
After that, we have defined the action performed method, which is taking an action event argument

76
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,230
a.

77
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,180
Then if I don't get sources because was to be one so that if the source of the event is from one.

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,250
What we are doing is a string and as it goes to one point, get text so in the string and we are restoring

79
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,460
the content of the text field in a string.

80
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,500
G We are restoring the content of the.

81
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,920
C one selected item is a string.

82
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,220
A We are showing the content of the string, the content of the text field 53 Similarly in C four in

83
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,960
C 85 and in 86.

84
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,670
And in T seven.

85
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:19,870
Now we have created a query to update the details of the employ of the string named as Q Are we inside

86
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:28,600
which we have the statement update, employee set, name and address state city email phone where ID

87
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,280
will be key to get selected item.

88
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,690
So this will be the query.

89
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,830
Inside the Tribe blog.

90
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,070
We have created the connection by using our coupon class.

91
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,800
We have updated, we have executed called the execute update method by passing the Q or inside that.

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,540
Then we have shown that dialog box that employer related successfully console.log will handle any exception

93
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,210
if occurs.

94
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,530
Hey don't get sources close to the source of the button is from way too.

95
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,760
So what we need to do is we need to delete the detail of that particular employ.

96
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,490
For that, we need to stabilize the connection with the database.

97
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,470
Then we will be executing the query that delete from employee where IDs goes to see to get selected

98
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:07,910
item.

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,250
So this will be deleting complete record for that particular ID and we will show the dialog box that

100
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,380
employee deleted.

101
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,860
After that, we will set the current visibility of the window as false.

102
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,330
Then inside the item changed method.

103
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:28,590
We are taking the item event i.e. as object or argument for that particular method.

104
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,480
We are creating the instance of our common class which will help us to create a stabilize connection

105
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,740
with our database.

106
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,480
And we are executing the query that select extra from the employee where it will match.

107
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:49,610
So this will select the record of all the record, all record for that particular ID from our employee

108
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,150
table.

109
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:56,090
And we are restoring the respective details of that particular ID in our text fields.

110
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,230
The one, three, three, three, four, three, five, three, six and seven cache block will handle

111
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,150
any exception if occurs and inside the void public void string areas.

112
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,480
We are just creating the update employee class instance.

113
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,130
So this is all about the update employee class.

114
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,440
Let's look at the last class.

115
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,060
That is the payslip class.

116
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:22,080
So in this class we have first imported the necessary packages Java, Java, starting Java and Java

117
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,430
DOT Event Public Class Payslip, which is extending g frame and implementing action listener choices

118
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,500
equals to C one.

119
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,380
There is a one choice.

120
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,820
There is a one text area and there is the one button inside the non parameter constructor of this class.

121
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,760
What we are doing is we are setting the size of that window 800, comma, 700 and its location as foreign

122
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,800
comma 150.

123
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,960
Then there is a seven choice variable for that.

124
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,290
We have created the instance of the class and with the help of the results.

125
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,340
At instance, we are executing the query with the help of 7.. execute query.

126
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,060
We have passed select extract from Sally.

127
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,720
This will select all the record from the salary table and while others start next, we are adding that

128
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,180
ID of our employers from the salary table to our choice instance.

129
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,840
Then we have set the layout as the border layout.

130
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,080
Then we have created a panel panel.

131
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,560
Now inside the panel, we have added a label as Select ID, and inside the panel we have added the choice

132
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:17,920
and stance.

133
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,510
Also.

134
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:25,150
Now we have added the panel with north location in our frame and after that.

135
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:33,500
What we are doing is we are creating a a new test area of size 30, 80, and we are passing that text

136
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:40,370
area object into the scroll panel because text area must be scrollable if the details is little more

137
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,780
than the particular defined size.

138
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,830
So that's why we have added a scroll panel over that text area.

139
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,540
Then there is a font type of variable F one, which is setting the font that arial font family arial

140
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,610
font type bold and font sizes.

141
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,010
20.

142
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,730
Then what we are doing is that we want f one.

143
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,580
So for that particular text field, we have set the font as a fun and b when it goes to new button which

144
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,600
is generate payslip and adding that button to the south position in this frame.

145
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,320
And similarly we have added the GSP and added it to our centre that the scroll panel.

146
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,170
After that we have added action to our button.

147
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:25,300
Now what we are doing is that the action perform the method we have here is an argument action event

148
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,170
type of object inside this method.

149
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,720
Now inside that log, we are creating an instance of our icon class.

150
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,930
Inside the results that we are executing query select aspect from employee where it will be selected

151
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,440
item.

152
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,840
So for that particular selected and the record of the employee will be selected for our start next we

153
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,630
are installing the name and our string name.

154
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,690
We are closing the details, we are closing the address connection.

155
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,760
Then we will updating the address as equals to save or not execute.

156
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,690
Query to select all the details from the salary where it will match and we will be calculating double

157
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,660
crosses close to zero yet and double digit goes to zero till now.

158
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,020
After that we are creating the Java Date Day when it goes to a new Java date which will select the date

159
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,920
of the current date.

160
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,090
And then there is a month, which is one month.

161
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,460
After that it will be showing PT one set text.

162
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,480
This will for the formatting purpose we have.

163
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,030
I have shown you like this payslip for the month of that particular month or 2019.

164
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,520
So this is the detail.

165
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:42,520
And inside the D1 field we will be adding and after appending a new line to our text area, then for

166
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,860
the next record we will show the details like an employee ID by from getting a string from the ID employee

167
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,270
name from the name and even append this line and the new line will double HRA.

168
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,430
We will be showing a HRA.

169
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,390
Similarly, we will be showing the I made PFF and basic salary by calculating the addition of that all

170
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,790
the things then net salary will be gross minus PV.

171
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,970
After that, we will be showing the basic salary.

172
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,230
Then we will be sharing the details tags.

173
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,450
With the help of this, we are adding everything in our text area.

174
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,940
Then at last, the signature.

175
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,060
Inside the cancer block.

176
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,760
We will be handling any exception if occurs and then public static white men string args.

177
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:39,140
We are paying the slip that is creating the new payslip class instance and set the visibility as to.

178
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,520
So that's all from the Java classes of this project.

179
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,280
In the last video or the next video, we will be having a look at the library of this project.

180
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,590
So that's all in this video.
