00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:09.990
So after the successful completion of all the Java classes here, I hope you have a lot of knowledge

2
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.330
about object oriented programming.

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.460
Now looking at some more features of this program.

4
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.180
So before starting.

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.920
Let me add this, that we have a correction here.

6
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:34.510
Previously I have typed it as total money spent, but here we have to subtract it with total money earned.

7
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.920
So total money.

8
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.990
And suppose if school on 2000 so the money spent will be 2000 minus the salary.

9
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.750
Suppose it is 700.

10
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.820
So the salary will be subtracted from the money earned by the school.

11
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.900
So.

12
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.200
Let me comment this out and explain it again.

13
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.140
So 2000 is the money earned initially stored in this variable?

14
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.300
Later on the variable stored.

15
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.910
The variable will store a value of 2000 -700.

16
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.800
Suppose.

17
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:23.680
So the value will be equal to 1300, so the total money spent will return 1300 and the money earned

18
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.930
will left the money and will be left as 1300 in total.

19
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:38.290
So yes, this was a correction that spent is the wrong and on the correct to be subtracted from.

20
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.480
Now removing this.

21
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.730
Let us move forward towards our main de jour.

22
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.940
Where we left.

23
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.130
So, yes, we have created the school A, B, C and.

24
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.210
This outed the earned money by the school.

25
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.200
So when someone not paid the fee, says 60,000.

26
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.440
The font in the school was 60,000.

27
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.250
We have run it and will run it again.

28
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.400
Yes.

29
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.350
So the school has earned 60,000.

30
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.400
Now.

31
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.740
Yes.

32
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.770
So let me add some more.

33
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.940
Funds like suppose that the.

34
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.770
These fees.

35
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.000
Of 50,000.

36
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.760
Now running it again.

37
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.170
The funds should increase.

38
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.040
Yes.

39
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.710
Perfect.

40
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.700
So now the funds in the school is one lakh 10,000 paid by both the student and totaling them.

41
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.240
No.

42
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.070
Let us.

43
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.530
Think about adding a new teacher to the.

44
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.160
Feature list of the school.

45
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.170
So we have a list.

46
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.200
There is no restrictions in adding teacher.

47
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.760
We have unlimited size so we can add any number of features.

48
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.150
So let's add a new teacher to the school.

49
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.640
So we will add a new teacher in the similar way we have added it here.

50
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.230
So adding it as teacher.

51
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.820
Let us name her.

52
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.630
Meena?

53
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.590
Yes.

54
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.730
So Meena wants to join the school ABC.

55
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.090
So she is new.

56
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.380
We have to set an ID for her.

57
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.780
So she is member of the teacher object.

58
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.550
So yes, yes.

59
00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.910
So it is demanding for ID name and the salary she should be given.

60
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.360
So we have already declared it as 1 to 3.

61
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.090
So find a unique id for Meena so we can give her an idea of six citing.

62
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.780
Yes.

63
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.260
The string input to her name.

64
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.500
And let us suppose let us suppose she is going to pay the salary of 9000.

65
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.850
Yes.

66
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.610
Perfect.

67
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.650
So Mina is added to the school and.

68
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.000
We have to add to it to the list like this.

69
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.740
Yes.

70
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.040
School.

71
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.080
Not Ed teacher.

72
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.630
Mina.

73
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.780
Yes.

74
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.810
So we have named the school as ABC.

75
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.120
The school is a busy.

76
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.900
Yes.

77
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.490
Now it is perfect.

78
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.970
So, I mean, is added to the school.

79
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.810
Now.

80
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.950
Suppose that the feces collected from the student.

81
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.900
Now, what if we have to pay salary to the teachers?

82
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.160
So giving this a good heading.

83
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.500
Like suppose we print as a heading to.

84
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.840
Yeah.

85
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.610
Schools.

86
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.100
Base salary.

87
00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.050
School is going to pay salary to the teachers in a separate block.

88
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.400
Yes.

89
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.900
So.

90
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.160
Giving it a good.

91
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.830
Look.

92
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.740
The heading should look nice, right?

93
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.790
So, yes.

94
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.660
Now suppose that the teacher named Samantha is paid salary.

95
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.910
So Samantha don't receive salary.

96
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.610
Yes.

97
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.990
The is if is called from the teacher class here.

98
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.750
Receive salary.

99
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.280
Yes.

100
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.250
So here is the receive salary.

101
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.890
Receive salary function.

102
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.050
It turns the salary earned by a specific teacher.

103
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.410
It works in the manner of salary.

104
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.250
Earn is equal to salary plus salary earn.

105
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.360
Initially, the salary earned by any teacher is zero.

106
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.250
Here it is mentioned.

107
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:14.960
After the credit condition of the salary to the Samantha's account, she will be having a total salary

108
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.460
of 9000.

109
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.990
Let me check.

110
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.340
What was her?

111
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.460
35,000.

112
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.060
So Samantha will have a total salary of 5000.

113
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.430
So yes, calling the receive salary function from the teacher class.

114
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.030
We have to write it in a way like Samantha.

115
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.470
Don't get salary.

116
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.880
Samantha got the salary, so?

117
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.540
Yes.

118
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.620
Samantha gets salary.

119
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.420
It's called her.

120
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.540
The method is invoked here.

121
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.630
So if we try to print out this system out.

122
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.220
Yes.

123
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.310
So write it in this way.

124
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.730
That ABC School.

125
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.590
Spent.

126
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.150
For salary to.

127
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:31.420
Now for adding a variable in the print syntax, we have to use this plus icon.

128
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.560
So, yes.

129
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.610
Calling the Samantha object.

130
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:47.200
Not getting the name as a string is done by this get name function and.

131
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:55.960
The variable is enclosed by a plus symbol at the beginning and the end after which.

132
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:06.290
We have to print what the school is left with so we could write it in this way and now has.

133
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.310
So school is left with how much money?

134
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.210
And again declaring a variable school.

135
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.710
Not yet.

136
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.750
Yes.

137
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.490
The total money spent for the salary?

138
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.180
Yes.

139
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.600
So again, the school name is ABC.

140
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.690
Right.

141
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.490
So let us try running this.

142
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.830
I think that is an error.

143
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.380
Let me try to fix this error.

144
00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:03.000
So yes, after fixing it, the total money earned and again running to check what are the funds that

145
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.620
the school is left with.

146
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.390
On running.

147
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.770
Yes.

148
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.370
So the school has earned one lakh 10,000.

149
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.490
This is the title for the salary.

150
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:22.990
School has spent for a salary to Samantha and now has ten one lakh and 5000.

151
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:33.050
Like initially the school received the fees from Jordan rather and then paid fear salary to Samantha.

152
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:41.320
So 60,000 plus 50,000 and subtracting 5000 from the salary part.

153
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:47.260
The funds left with the school is one lakh 5000 and it is perfectly fine.

154
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.940
Yes.

155
00:10:49.480 --> 00:11:00.340
So now let us suppose that school pays salary to one more teacher like the third one was.

156
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.450
Copied this part and paste it again.

157
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.550
Yes.

158
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.640
So the third one is.

159
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.860
What is the name here?

160
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.780
Yes.

161
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.040
So it is possibly.

162
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:27.080
So that second payment is made to him and.

163
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.340
Placing everywhere.

164
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.560
So this school has paid the salary to the second teacher.

165
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:44.320
And again, we want to check what are the funds left at the school?

166
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.910
Surrounding it again.

167
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.660
Yes.

168
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.560
Perfect.

169
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.250
So school hasn't won like 10,000.

170
00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:04.940
Then the pay salary shows payments to Samantha, and then school is left with this money after paying

171
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:05.130
it.

172
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.840
Also, the now school is left with this money.

173
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.270
So I hope you understood the concept behind this program.

174
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:25.730
We are calling the functions, invoking the methods and printing it out in our output terminal.

175
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:31.820
So it is a beautiful way to learn the basic Java concept.

176
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.840
Now.

177
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:41.550
In the next part, we are going to learn how to add some more specifications to this code.
