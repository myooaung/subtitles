1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.900
So here is my my command line client.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.100
So I have already logged in into the command line and here the query use EBS.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.930
So I have used my database that showing database chains.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.080
Then I have checked for tables.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.750
Which tables do I have in my database?

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.270
So here is the list of tables that this is the list build customer meta info and then then I will.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.710
Here I have shown you select aspect from login.

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.050
So this is showing the details of the logging.

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.630
Log in table is have.

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.660
Toodles.

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.730
So as the first one is the admin, you can see this row.

12
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.550
This row is the user is admin.

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.800
So this row don't having any metre number as admin will not have a metre number, but the customer is

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.260
having a metre number.

15
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.500
I will be doing and adding new admin and customer just when I run the program in this video.

16
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.970
Am showing showing you the database database for the reference select aspect from customers or customer.

17
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.360
Table is containing a single customer.

18
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.430
This is the same customer name and a meter number which there is an login section here in the customer

19
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.030
section.

20
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.280
Now in my SQL bill.

21
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.560
So in the build table we have I have shown you the bill for the same meter number month of January.

22
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.040
And this is the bill that is, is not paid and the meter info meter involves the same meter number of

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.830
the same customer because there is only one customer till now.

24
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:41.360
And this is the tax which we have set as default, which will only have one row to calculate the total

25
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.260
bill of the customer.

26
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.540
Now we will move to our project and run our file login file.

27
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.420
So here is our ID and I am going to run this login page.

28
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.260
I am currently in log in Java file and I will run this file.

29
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.230
So we will see this kind of.

30
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.770
Login page.

31
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.750
Now.

32
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.070
Yes.

33
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.620
So here the login page is this.

34
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.760
Now, first of all, we need to sign up for the admin.

35
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.860

Sign up as admin.

39
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.540
So I will create a username.

40
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.290
So.

41
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.450
Here in the logging section I have user name ID and one so I will create here a m.

42
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.190
To add to that will be second admin.

43
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:48.540
Its name or its name will be admin two and its password will be a 2 to 3.

44
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.100
So and the customer create account as admin.

45
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.780
So let's click on create.

46
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.240

Click on.

48
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.400
Okay.

49
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.730
So this will switch us back to the login page.

50
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.070
Now we will log in from the create created admin account.

51
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.880
So a be username was adam to password was ad2 to three.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.740
Let me show you that the details of the signup must be added in our database section.

53
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.940
So if I saw the login table again.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:38.640
So as you can see here in this login table, admin two has been added as soon as we have signed up from

55
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.320
our page.

56
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.470
So now let's log in to the page.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.310
So I will hit login with the admin two and as soon as I click on login so this page will appear.

58
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.040
This is the page for the admin.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.880
When we click on master, you can add customer new customer customer details, deposit details and calculate

61
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.060

Here are its shortcuts as well.

63
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.050
And then utility.

So I'll be adding cost to C USD two and the meter number is as we produce the randomly and the address,

71
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.380
let's suppose it's address is a.

Let's suppose we will click on inside meter type electric meter, solar meter, smart meter.

92
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.540
Let it be a solar meter and face code.

It is not showing because we haven't generated the bill.

126

First we have to sign up as well.

154
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.090
So for the signup username we will be using the same username which we have added by the admin.
