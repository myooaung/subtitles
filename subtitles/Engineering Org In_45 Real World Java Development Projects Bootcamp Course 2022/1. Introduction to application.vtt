00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.060
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.790
So in the series of learning how to make projects in Java today, we are going to learn about this project

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.240
which is called as ATM Management System.

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:21.280
So in this project, which is actually made in core Java, we will be learning about that, how actually

5
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:29.890
our management system works, what are the like input fields and accordingly, what are the outputs

6
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.210
attached to those inputs correspond like those corresponding inputs and how actually everything works

7
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.080
inside.

8
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.040
And real time management system.

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.910
So on your screens you can see the opening window of like this application which we are going to make

10
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.540
today.

11
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.410
And in this application, initially, this page will open like saying this title as.

12
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.660
Welcome to the Team Project.

13
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.160
Initially, there will be two options that we will have to type either one or two.

14
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:14.200
One will be for logging in into the management system if you are already existing user.

15
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.080
Otherwise, if you are new user, then you have to type two in order to create a new account.

16
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:30.670
So suppose we are like a new user, so we will be wishing to create a new account in this system.

17
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.300
So we will be choosing choice to on hitting to from your keyboards.

18
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.660
We will enter in a window asking for our customer number.

19
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.380
So suppose I have entered ask any random customer number as one, two, three, four.

20
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.900
Then after this customer number entering process, we will be asked to for entering a PIN number which

21
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.100
we want to register.

22
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.170
This is a very like security based thing.

23
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.740
So we have to keep our pin very private.

24
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.860
We have to enter our pin in very secure, security minded manner.

25
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:25.180
Like we do not have to enclose this pin to any other user or any other like our friends or relatives.

26
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.960
Only those people are able to know the pin who are actually very close to you, who will be accessing

27
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.680
your account.

28
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.970
So keep this in mind that this pin is very private, like logging in.

29
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:51.910
So yes, once you enter your customer number and your pin, then your account will be successfully like

30
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.520
registered in this ATM management system.

31
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.240
So once this is registered, then the next process will be to redirecting into logging.

32
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:11.020
So we have already discussed that if we are a new user, then we have to create an account and after

33
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.920
which we have to log in if we are existing customer.

34
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.080
So once we created the account, we become automatically the existing customer.

35
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.470
So we will be redirecting to login.

36
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.660
In the login process.

37
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.220
We will be asked for our customer number and our PIN number.

38
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:40.050
So we have to enter both and we have to remind this info in order to login in future also.

39
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:49.540
So like keep these things written somewhere or memorize these two credentials, your customer number

40
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.770
and your pin number.

41
00:03:51.160 --> 00:04:00.010
So if you enter any of the wrong credentials, then automatically you will enter this system.

42
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.480
Like do not enter this system, you will exit the system automatically and login will be filled of course.

43
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.840
So once you enter the correct credentials then you have to like select the account you want to access.

44
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.690
So we have different types of accounts in this management system.

45
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:32.470
We have checking account, savings account, and the third option is to like exit this frame window

46
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.670
or whatever we save.

47
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:45.340
So once we enter our like choice of the types of account suppose we enter to or so we have entered to

48
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.880
our first savings account and we enter the framework of the savings account.

49
00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:00.250
In this savings and account interface, we are provided with five options asking for that.

50
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:09.000
What we want to perform inside our account, whether we want to view the balance, withdraw the funds,

51
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.120
deposit the funds, transfer the funds, or exit this saving window.

52
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.270
Life Saving Accounts Window Interface.

53
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:25.370
So suppose we want to deposit funds as we have just created our account in this system.

54
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.080
So obviously there is no money.

55
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.970
So we have entered choice three for depositing funds.

56
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.850
As soon as we enter this option three for depositing funds automatically, this shows that current savings

57
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.120
account balance is zero, which is like natural.

58
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.900
We are a new user so we do not have any deposits already to this account.

59
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.870
So this will be asking that amount you want to deposit into your savings account.

60
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.530
So suppose we want to like deposit $10,000.

61
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.910
So yes, after this entering process, the money will be deposited to your account.

62
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:17.280
Current savings account balance will reflect a value of $10,000, which is addition to this initial

63
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.660
like $0.

64
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.680
So after this, suppose we want to perform any other like tasks.

65
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.930
So yes.

66
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.720
So the second choice will be to withdraw funds.

67
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:41.550
So suppose we have deposited funds to our account then a few days later or after, like for checking

68
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.540
initially we want to check that even if the withdraw is working correctly or not, we want to withdraw

69
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.600
some money from our like deposited money.

70
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.010
So current savings account balance will be reflected every time we enter any of the choices.

71
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:05.910
It will show that you have this money, then decide what money you want to deposit or transfer or anything

72
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.110
you wish to.

73
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:14.100
So suppose we want to like withdraw $2,000 from our savings account.

74
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:22.380
So after the like withdrawal of money, the current saving account balance will be reduced.

75
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.930
Obviously we have withdraw some money.

76
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:34.140
So the current saving account balance will reflect a value which will be like the subtracted value from

77
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:40.560
the initial account balance and the withdrawal of money, like the money which we withdraw on.

78
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:47.850
So after this, our current savings account balance will be $8,000, which is very natural.

79
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.320
We have withdrawn 2000.

80
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.820
So what is left?

81
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.550
This is left after this.

82
00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:01.650
Suppose in the next step we want to like option fortieths, transfer the funds.

83
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:12.510
So once we enter the key for from our keyboard in the transfer funds option or the function will be

84
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.620
activated.

85
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.430
So what is actually transfer funds?

86
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:24.660
So we have to firstly like select the type of account from which we want to transfer the funds.

87
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:31.560
The fund transfer could be to anyone, our friends, our relatives, any professional use or anything

88
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.560
so we can choose like from which type of account we want to transfer the funds.

89
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.370
So we are already in the savings account interface.

90
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.410
So we just have to like switch to checking.

91
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.150
There is no savings account option for her also.

92
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:56.670
So yes, suppose I want to like transfer the funds from checking type of account.

93
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.830
So I have choose option one.

94
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.770
So current savings account balance will be shown.

95
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:08.610
You may be wondering that why it is showing savings account balance.

96
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:15.810
I have choose this checking account because we have no balance in our checking account balance.

97
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:25.620
So it will automatically like reflect the savings account balance and from there only we can transfer

98
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.580
the funds.

99
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:35.790
So amount you want to deposit into your savings account so we can transfer the funds between savings

100
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.950
account and checking account.

101
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:45.840
So from the checking account we are amount to deposit our savings account.

102
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:57.410
So the current checking account balance will become $1 and the savings account balance will become $7,999

103
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.560
automatically.

104
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.210
This value is subtracted.

105
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.330
We have 8000 in our savings account.

106
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.920
We want to transfer funds to our checking account as we have no money in our checking account.

107
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:17.880
So we are like transferring funds between our own accounts right now to check the functionalities of

108
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.610
the system.

109
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.210
Okay.

110
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.930
So we are done with the transfer fund.

111
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:29.210
The thing now, the next process we are going to check is view balance.

112
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.410
So automatically view balances working with every step.

113
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.880
But there is a dedicated functionalities for viewing balance.

114
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.800
Like just we have to view balance, nothing else.

115
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:50.490
So on pressing one, our savings account balance will automatically reflect as we are currently in our

116
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.320
savings account interface.

117
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.020
Now our next process is to exit.

118
00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:01.860
So we have exited this savings account interface on hitting five from our keyboard.

119
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:11.380
Now again, we are back in the interface which was like initially present at the time of the logging.

120
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:19.500
Like we have run this program and this was the actual on logging in, this was the actual interface.

121
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.060
We were like, See?

122
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:31.260
So yes, we are done with every checking of functionality and our next choice will be to exit this management

123
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.510
system interface.

124
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.330
So on hitting three, this message will appear there.

125
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:43.530
Thank you for using this item and you will be exiting the interface of the item management system.

126
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.980
Now you may be wondering that we are going to make this project.

127
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.590
So what will be the call like?

128
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.420
Things we will be like keeping in mind before making this project.

129
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.590
So this is basically item management system.

130
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:08.850
We have already discussed it, so we are going to manage everything about this item management system,

131
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:14.130
all the functionalities we just encountered in the previous slide.

132
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:19.680
We will be making everything on our own writing code from scratch.

133
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:26.430
Everything will be done a step by step and like we are going to manage everything about this system,

134
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.570
what actually the system is providing facilities.

135
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.740
So this is for like accessing different types of account.

136
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:43.230
We have already seen accounts, checking account, savings accounts and the functionalities is to withdraw

137
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.410
money, check balance, depositing money.

138
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:54.540
And also we can transfer funds within account with a feature of choosing the account step, which we

139
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.850
have already seen in the previous slides.

140
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:04.200
So this is the basic specification of the project we are going to make.

141
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:09.810
These are the functionalities which we we will be writing the program about.

142
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:18.060
So yes, after all the specification part, you may be wondering that what are the concepts we are going

143
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.780
to learn after the successful completion of this project?

144
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.660
So the first thing we are going to learn is object oriented programming in Java.

145
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:36.090
So after the completion of this project, you will be having a good grasp at object oriented programming

146
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.810
and what actually object oriented programming is.

147
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.440
It is about like tackling the real world entities.

148
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:50.280
Objects are real world entities and we are like learning object oriented programming.

149
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.270
So everything will be around objects, methods and classes only.

150
00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:02.190
Now the second thing we are going to learn is to make a Java application from scratch so everything

151
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.290
will be done step by step.

152
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:13.890
We are going to like write everything one by one, explaining every part and not going to miss anything.

153
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:20.490
We are going to learn data structures such as hash maps, which case added strings and so on.

154
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.630
So there are like plenty of knowledge about data structures.

155
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:31.860
We will beginning in Java after the completion of this project, our Java idea management system will

156
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.700
be the output after this completion of this project.

157
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.120
And of course that is object oriented programming.

158
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.060
Then there will be definitely classes and objects.

159
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:50.880
So basically it is going to be a good concept based project that is no fancy like interface we are going

160
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.420
to make.

161
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:58.920
We are just going to learn the concepts, the basics and all the things about the ATM management system.

162
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.920
In Java.

163
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:07.900
And after the completion of this project, you will be mindful about all the concepts, whether it be

164
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.880
object oriented programming, whether it be data structures in Java and everything.
