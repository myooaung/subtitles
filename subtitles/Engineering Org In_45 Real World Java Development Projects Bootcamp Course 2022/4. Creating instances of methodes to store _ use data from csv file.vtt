1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.990
In previous things.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.230
I told you how we are developing this and how we are going with this only.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.950
So in further things, I'm going to mention how this is very efficient.

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.510
So as I created everything here.

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.430
So this is basically see as we as these are the files are CSV comma separated files I need to create

6
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.270
in tabular manner.

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.490
So I'm using here dependency.

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.090
Or we can say library which is basically comes Apache.

9
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.030
So for that purpose, what I'm doing here, I'm just use dependency injection.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.100
I mentioned in the import XML that dependency, this dependency.

11
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.340
Me close this so I can use this directly here so you can see this.

12
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.130
So what is a beautiful thing of dependency on dependency injection is I don't want to require download

13
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.860
this each and everything so my ID and spring frame will take care of that to invoke that part.

14
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.150
So these are all about how we are going to do this.

15
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:09.910
So see, as we record, I need to create one thing so you can create a class for that, or you can mention

16
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.020
that part also.

17
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.140
Holding the.

18
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.240
Okay.

19
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.850
So we need to import that library.

20
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.000
Also, I think there is different thing you can do here is basically all the entries doing and adding

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.350
the files here.

22
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.360
If you don't want to put that, you can put the star here and it will invoke that part.

23
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.650
Also, let me show you how I'm going to do this if I'm putting your star, what is happening, you can

24
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.190
see here.

25
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.060
So likewise that I'm going to do this.

26
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.100
So this is basically a terrible thing.

27
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.300
What is the iteration?

28
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.970
Iteration in the if you know, the for loops also or loop looping part is the basically iteration.

29
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.890
So I need to create one loop here.

30
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.490
So why the loop is required as our data is very huge.

31
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.440
I don't want to specify only one string.

32
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.490
I want to go to the next string also until the data is not over.

33
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.140
So I need to mention the loop here.

34
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.570
So let me go to the looping part.

35
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.410
What I'm going to mention is here is so for this looping part, I am going to create.

36
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.340
One loop for each loop, I'm going to create c.

37
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.180
S v.

38
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.630
Record because it's a record thing.

39
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.910
So yes, we record.

40
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.360
Which is basically record.

41
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.300
See as we record.

42
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.110
Record is the default thing you can see here.

43
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.290
Which is basically records.

44
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.060
So this is the looping part.

45
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.280
So I need to mention some location stats here.

46
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.750
So let me go with this location statistics.

47
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.450
So I will tell you what I'm going to do is creating location sites and what is the location stats here,

48
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.330
each and everything.

49
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.180
These are the some default things you need to mention because in my CSV file also these things are there

50
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.050
said country.

51
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.890
Each and everything.

52
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:19.290
I am going to create that part later with some integer parsing things because these are the latest cases

53
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.880
and previous cases and these are the integers and these things are stored in strings.

54
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.150
But I need to create and integer so I'm changing this to integer part.

55
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.490
Then.

56
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.640
Let me do one thing more here.

57
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.530
Okay.

58
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.730
Well, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do is here and.

59
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.420
Before these things after the recording.

60
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.110
Okay.

61
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.850
So the significance of this is basically new statistics I mentioned in the statistics each and everything.

62
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.350
So for the thing, let me do one thing here.

63
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.680
It's.

64
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.660
It was not returning.

65
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.650
Let me see that.

66
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.180
Okay.

67
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.890
So there are the errors.

68
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.940
Forget about the errors.

69
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.690
And I will tell you what I'm going to do is here basically.

70
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.790
So this is the all the things I'm going to mention, but I need to mention one annotation, which is

71
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.020
basically run this as a service because my string framework doesn't know this is the Java file or what

72
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.490
is the things?

73
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.950
Things.

74
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.140
So I need to mention it as a service.

75
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.470
So let me.

76
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.620
Enable this as a service.

77
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.240
So I enable this as a service, but.

78
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.280
Let me import Java X also here because annotation doesn't support this.

79
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.290
Okay.

80
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.080
So.

81
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.690
I need to mention Java X annotations then.

82
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:25.170
Spring framework also because these are some important libraries here I'm going to mention, which is

83
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.030
basically service as a service.

84
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.150
I think now we are.

85
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.110
Then.

86
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.810
So that's it.

87
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.470
I'm going to mention this here.

88
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.930
So it will involve the service part here.

89
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.150
And now what is this doing?

90
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.360
Is it mentioned that it's also servicing with spring framework.

91
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.260
So it will loop it again and again and it will use this as a service.

92
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.790
Consider this as a service.

93
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.630
Before moving further, I need to mention the post construct part also in this phase data virus.

94
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.100
So let me go down here a little bit.

95
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.440
So.

96
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.100
Let me mention this as a post construct.

97
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.870
Post construct is nothing but the main method you can say your.

98
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.630
Was constructed.

99
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.520
And now what is the main thing I'm going to mention is here basically I need to schedule this.

100
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.140
Well, I need to show you this.

101
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.300
There are two things here for the scheduling purpose.

102
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.040
Okay.

103
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.080
So this is the scheduling.

104
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.610
Now, what is the schedule?

105
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.030
Things is going to work.

106
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.610
It will run it again and again with Chron.

107
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.440
Or we can say chronology with some simple things.

108
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.670
Let me mention your Chron.

109
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.200
Is equal to.

110
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.610
In this only.

111
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.970
So one, two, three, four, five, six.

112
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.020
So these are the six we can say symbols of these thing.

113
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.310
And let me specify this gap between all the things.

114
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.670
So this is 4 seconds minutes of our day and all the things here.

115
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.050
So what you can do, it will invoke according to the clock.

116
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.090
So I need to mention and which time period it needs to invoke.

117
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.550
So I'm considering one hour of each day.

118
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.230
Now note that if our file is or we can say this file is updating every day.

119
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.800
Or we can say it's updating in every hour.

120
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.250
You need to mention here, one minute, not this one hour.

121
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.080
So why we require that?

122
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.520
I'm mentioning by the day only by the one hour it will invoke.

123
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.290
But if your data is updating again and again, you need to change this.

124
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.150
So for my case, I'm putting this only.

125
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:09.230
No need to mention or stress this topic more because this is just a chronological thing.

126
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.500
You can change it to this one and you can put the start here.

127
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.760
So what is the thing it's going to do?

128
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.960
It's going to take care of that part.

129
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:27.740
So now in the folder thing, I created everything, but I created the services part, but I need to

130
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.160
mention the model part here.

131
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:36.680
So what is the model part is basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to create one model's thing

132
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.150
to store everything.

133
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.860
As I told you, I created location stats each and everything, but I'm not mentioning it.

134
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.720
As I told in the folder, I created that country each and everything here.

135
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.520
So I need to mention this.

136
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.960
So let me show you.

137
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.910
What I do in this set country is a data entry, each and everything.

138
00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:03.320
So instead of putting this directly in this part, in the services part, what I can do, I can do or

139
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.200
I can move, create one another class to invoke this.

140
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.430
So.

141
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:17.410
Let me do this in further part, but let me mention this first.

142
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.960
What I'm going to do is go to the project part as I created your services.

143
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.680
Let me create one more thing.

144
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.070
Here is Java class and let me mention everything here.

145
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.100
So first is basically models.

146
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.890
Models is our sub page.

147
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.850
And in this package location stretch, I'm going to add.

148
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.560
So I'm going to store only locations.

149
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.260
I'm not going to store each and everything.

150
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.180
So let me create here class.

151
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.270
Or you can say this is loaded and this is the location class here.

152
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:59.170
Sometimes it gives error, because I need to specify here one more thing.

153
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.720
He's basically.

154
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.690
In both.

155
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.780
Oh.

156
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.970
It is giving me error because.

157
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.990
I need to import location stats here also.

158
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.820
So let me import this package.

159
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:28.690
So I mentioned here and why it is.

160
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.430
Let me look.

161
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.830
Okay.

162
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:31.050
Okay.

163
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.240
Okay.

164
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.880
I made one error because.

165
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.390
I mentioned my another failure is not belong to this project.

166
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.530
So okay.

167
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.890
So location stats successfully added.

168
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.340
So we are required with this.

169
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.770
So the further part, I'm going to create one location stats and I'm going to mention how this is going

170
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.730
to work here.

171
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.940
So till this you think understood everything I'm mentioning, I mentioned everything.

172
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:06.240
So in later part I'm going to deploy location stats and I'm going to create model everything here.

173
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:12.270
So stick to this project and check for the spring frameworks.

174
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:18.060
