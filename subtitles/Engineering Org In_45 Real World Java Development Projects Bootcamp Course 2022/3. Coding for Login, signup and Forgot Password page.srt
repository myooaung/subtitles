1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,150
So here is our login class, which is defined inside the package.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,720
Travel.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:12,850
Importing the necessary packages like Java Auditability, java dot string, java dot event, java scale.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,280
And then we have defined the public class log in which is extending frame and implementing Excel listener.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:27,280
After that, there is a private instance of a text field, a password field, and the three buttons.

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,150
Then we have defined the public login non press constructor, setting the background color of the frame

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,640
bounds of the frame.

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,930
Then we have defined the instance of panel setting background color of the panel layout.

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,480
Adding that panel to the frame and setting the layout of the panel.

10
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,190
After that, there is another label as user name setting the bound for the username whose location is

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,430
124 comma 18 and sizes 95, cross 24 and adding that label to the panel.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:06,050
After that, there is another label labeled as password host setting the bound for that whose location

13
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,430
is 124 2124 and size 95 cross 24 and adding to that, our panel.

14
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,300
Then there are respective text field that is text field for the username setting bound for it adding

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,450
to our panel.

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,730
Then there is a password field setting bound for it, adding it to our panel.

17
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,890
Then there is another label which is the empty label setting bound for it, adding it to our panel.

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,960
Then there's another label that is also an empty label sitting bound for it, adding it to that, our

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,470
panel.

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,580
Then we have created an image that is a log in image and added that log in image into a label and set

21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,580
it bound for the label and adding that label to our frame.

22
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,560
After that, there is a button B1, which is a log in button adding action to that button, setting

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,400
the foreground, background color and bound of the button, and adding that button to our panel.

24
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,810
After that, there is a sign up button adding action listener to that button, foreground and background

25
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,140
color of the button setting bound for the button, adding that button to our panel.

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,460
After that, there is a button three, which is a forgot password button adding access to it, foreground,

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:13,150
background, color, setting the bound of the red button and adding that button to our panel.

28
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,610
After that, there is another label for a label five, which is trouble in log in, setting font for

29
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,170
it, foreground for it, and bound for it, adding that to our panel.

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,530
After that, there is another panel setting background color for it and bound for it.

31
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,720
And adding to that, our panel.

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,780
After that, we have defined the action performed method with the action event object.

33
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,560
So if the action event sources from B1 button, so we will set the boolean variable status to false

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,400
and try inside that we will create the object of connection class, which we have just discussed in

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,730
our previous video, and then we will.

36
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,310
Creating the string SQL inside which we will, is storing the query select aspect from account where

37
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,680
username is equal to this and password is close to this.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,910
So prepare the statement.

39
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,110
We will create the prepared statement by passing that is equal to the prepared statement method by using

40
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,860
the connection object and the connection.

41
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,950
The and then we will set.

42
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,220
Using that purpose statement, we will set a strings in our database.

43
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,190
Text filled out by getting text filled from get text field and password from password field.

44
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,740
And after that we will execute that query as a result that will execute that statement, prepared statement

45
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,410
and if asked next then is set with well false and the new home class will be called.

46
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,380
And if the password does not match, then it will be shown invalid login or password in the cast block.

47
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,330
We will be catching the exception if any occurs.

48
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,470
If the source of the event is from Beta Button, we will set the visibility of the current Windows file

49
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,670
and call the sign up class and if the source of event is from beta, then we will set the visibility

50
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,820
of the current window as well and call the forward password class.

51
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,880
So let's move to our sign up class.

52
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,230
So sunglasses defined inside the package travel.

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,190
We have imported the necessary packages.

54
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,350
Java JWT.

55
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,280
Java String Java Java Debilitated Event, Java Linked Bar.

56
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,230
After that, we have defined the class which is extending frame and implementing action listener.

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,670
There is a private panel and.

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,920
Four text fields, two buttons and two combo box.

59
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,870
Inside the main function, we have created the object and set the visibility of the frame as true.

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,630
Then we have defined the non parameter as constructor.

61
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,150
After that we have set the bound for that frame and created the instance of.

62
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,580
Panel.

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,250
Master of that panel, adding that to the frame background of the panel.

64
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,690
Layout of the panel.

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,310
After that, we have.

66
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,240
Created a username setting foreground colour for it, font type and family and size for it bound for

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,830
it and adding that to our panel.

68
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,950
Under the label as name setting, foreground colour, font bound and adding to a panel.

69
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,760
Then there is another label password setting, foreground font bound and adding it to a panel.

70
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,710
Then there is another answer, which will be the answer of the security question.

71
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,810
Four wrong colour font bound and adding it to all the panel.

72
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,910
Then there is a combo box that will define the combo box with the security question, like your nickname,

73
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,920
your lucky number, your child superhero.

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,180
Your childhood name.

75
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,530
Combo box.

76
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,380
Said Bowen, sitting down for it, adding that box to the panel.

77
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,000
Then there is a security question label setting for one colour for it and.

78
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,390
Fought for it, bound for it, and adding that to our.

79
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,190
Panel.

80
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,900
After that, adding the image in the sign up and.

81
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,940
Adding that image to the label, then setting the bond for the label, adding that label to the frame.

82
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,520
Then there is a text field, respective text fields setting bound for it, adding to the panel, another

83
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,780
text field setting bound for it adding to that panel.

84
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:23,150
Then there are all the full text field have been set with their respective to their bounds and location

85
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,870
and size.

86
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,570
Then there is the button one which is create adding Excel font bound background color, foreground color,

87
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,970
adding that to our panel.

88
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:38,180
After that, there is a button B two which is labelled as backs action listener font lb foreground color,

89
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,270
background color and adding to that, our panel.

90
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,090
Then there is another gel, another panel for one color for it set the bottom.

91
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,910
This will be used to set the model with named as create account and set the bound for that panel.

92
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,610
And background color of that panel and adding that panel to our frame.

93
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:06,260
Now we have described the action performed event action performed method, which is taking an argument

94
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,070
as action event and instead we have created the connection.

95
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:16,490
If the source of the event is from button, then we will create a statement and stored it in the string

96
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,610
as well, which will say that insert into account with username, name, password, question, answer

97
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,360
and values.

98
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,030
Then we have created the prepared statement and inside the statement we have set a string for all the

99
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,810
fields by fetching respective details from the text field and the combo box and set the I is equals

100
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,430
to execute.

101
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,840
If the execute query will execute successfully, then I will have a non-zero value.

102
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,060
So if I will have a non-zero value, then it will show the dialogs, work that account, create a successfully.

103
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,240
Otherwise we will set the text fields as null again and if the source is for button B2, then we will

104
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:00,140
set the visibility of the current window as false and call the new login window again.

105
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,560
Cache block will handle an exception if occurs.

106
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,590
Now let's move to the forgot password class.

107
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,600
This will be used if you forgot password.

108
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,270
So let's have a look in forward password.

109
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:17,010
This is defined inside the package travel unnecessary package have been imported Java Swing, Swing,

110
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,510
Border, JavaScript and Java JWT event.

111
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,690
After that we have defined the four plus four class, which is extending JVM and implementing accents.

112
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,150
After that, there is a J panel five text field, three buttons inside the main function where we have

113
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,640
called the power password class and the visibility of the frame.

114
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,350
As to then we have defined the parameter as non parameterized constructor, setting the bound for that.

115
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,850
Frame, defining a panel, setting the border for it.

116
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,650
Adding to the frame background colour for it and layout as well.

117
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,850
Then there is a label, one setting font for it, bound for it.

118
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,140
Adding to that, our panel.

119
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,440
Then there is a label to name setting font for it, bound for it.

120
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,760
Adding to that, our panel.

121
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:05,870
Then there is a label your security question setting font for it bound for it.

122
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,700
Adding to that our panel.

123
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:14,450
Then there is a label for answer setting bound for it, font for it, bound for it and I to adding that

124
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,260
to our panel.

125
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,730
Similarly, we have the password label.

126
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,760
Then the respective text field, one setting font foreground bound.

127
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,540
Adding to that our panel for the text field PT one similarly for the PT 233, 84 and 85.

128
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,550
Then we have created the image icon.

129
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,120
Added that image icon to the label l6 setting bound for the label added that label to the frame.

130
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,370
After that, there is a button search setting x listener font bound background color, foreground color

131
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,780
and adding to that, our panel.

132
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,130
Similarly for the button B2 that is retrieved similarly for the button b three, that is for back then

133
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,180
there is another panel sitting bound for it and for background color is pink.

134
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,490
And adding to that, our panel.

135
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,980
Then we have defined the action performed.

136
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,160
Method which is taking action event object.

137
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,230
After that we inside the trip log.

138
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,040
We have created the instance of connection class.

139
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,580
If the source of the event is from V1, then we will create a query that is select as to from account

140
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,040
where username is equal to customer.

141
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,630
That is a prepared statement created nested that is equal to Condorcet or C a prepared statement pass

142
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,310
the Haskell into the prepared statement.

143
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,350
After that, we have to set the.

144
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,370
Uh, text which have been fetched from the.

145
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,370
Text field, Stephen, and we will execute that query.

146
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:50,600
And after iterating that results set, we will also send the name and question of the.

147
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,940
For that particular username in the account table.

148
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,940
After that, if the source of the button is from B2, we will select equip prepare a query select extract

149
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,190
from account where answer so.

150
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:13,780
For that, we will execute the and set the required text from the text for and execute that query and

151
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,710
again set the password for that particular username.

152
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,080
If the button is B3 and source of the event is from Beta three, then the visibility of the current

153
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,110
will will be false and new login object has been created and visibility will be set to true.

154
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,550
So this is all about the login.

155
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,710
Sign up and forgot password class.

156
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,480
Let me show you.

157
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,850
So I will be running the login file.

158
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,600
So this is the login file.

159
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,080
First we need to sign up so I will go and sign up.

160
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,110
This is the signup page so we we can sign up by writing details here.

161
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,910
I'll be not signing up right now.

162
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,520
I will click on back and I will be.

163
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,690
If I click on Forward Password, it will take us to the forgot password as well.

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,690
I will be kicking on back as well here.

165
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,770
And so those are the outputs of the three classes.
