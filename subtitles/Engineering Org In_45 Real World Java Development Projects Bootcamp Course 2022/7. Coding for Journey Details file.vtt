00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.390
So this is the general retail store file.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:16.260
And it is defined inside the package airline and we have imported the Java AWG package which will help

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.850
us to create graphical user interface and a blue dot event package which will help us to manage events

4
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.080
happening on the buttons or in our window.

5
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.140
Importing the.

6
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.450
Haskell package, which will help us to connect with our database.

7
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.880
Then we have imported the Java export swing framework and that's the package here that is inside provided

8
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.930
by this library.

9
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.960
After that, we have defined the class journey details, which is extending the frame.

10
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.190
There is an instance variable of type J stable and named as stable.

11
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.710
There are labels as well named as reservation details.

12
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.120
Panel number Ticket ID F Code Gen Y, Date Gen Y time that will be journey date journey time source

13
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.910
destination label and Label one.

14
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.500
Then there is a potential.

15
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.680
Static void main stream Argus.

16
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.330
No new journey details.

17
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.520
This will create the instance of the current class whenever it will be called and execute the constructor.

18
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.200
Here is the constructor that is non parameterized constructor and setting the title as journey details.

21
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.090
window as true then.

22
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.800
There is a label named as source and setting the font for it that will be font family as stoma, font

23
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.400
type as plain and font size is 19.

24
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.610
After that, we have set the bound for the font label source.

25
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:37.520
Location is 6100 and its size is one 5027, adding that sauce labels to a large frame or window.

26
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.000

Who's font family will be the font type as plane and font size is 31.

49
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.870
After that, we have set the bond for the label.

50
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.610
Whose location is to take all my 27 sizes?

51
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.320

Adding the label to our frame or window.

74
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:24.600
After that, we have another label as Journey Date, abbreviated as G and Y on the score date setting

75
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:34.110
the font for the Journey Date label whose font families Tahoma font type is plain and font size is 13,

76
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:42.240

Cross 20.

78
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.710
Adding that Gen Y journey date to our DJ frame.

79
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.990
Then there is a journey time new label as Journey Time.

80
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.390
And.

81
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.810
After that we have.

82
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:12.600
Set the font for the journey time font family has Tahoma font type plain font sizes 13 setting the bound.

83
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.180
For that.

84
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:23.800
Label location has for 94 comma to 70 and its size is 83 comma 20.

85
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.770
Adding it to our frame or window.

86
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.200
Another label as source.

87
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.240
Setting font for the source.

88
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.400
I think.

89
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.240
Wait a minute.

90
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.040
Source and destination have been defined previously.

91
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:53.460
So this source and destination will be for the selection of the string item from these combo works.

92
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.980
So don't get confused that they are repetitive.

93
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.730
They are repetitive but for a specified meaning.

94
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.360
After that we have set here font family stoma font type as plane font size is 15.

95
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.290
Setting the bound for that new label source.

96
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:23.820
All sizes 94 across 20 location is 613 common to 70 adding the sauce to our j frame or windows similarly

97
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.470
for the destination here.

98
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:34.280
We have added the destination whose font families Tahoma font type is plane font size sizes 13.

99
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.280
Setting the bound for it whose location is 717.

100
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.300
Comma to 70 and its size is 94.

101
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.950
Cross 20.

102
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.870
Adding the destination to the DJ frame.

103
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:58.020
After that we have defined a string, a string item one which is inside which we have defined the source.

104
00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.970
Bangalore, Mumbai.

105
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.900
Chennai, Patna.

106
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.830
Delhi, Hyderabad.

107
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.130
And DJ combo box.

108
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.790
Which will create a dropdown menu by using the string item once.

109
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:23.260
Setting the bond for the combo box location is one of 5100 and sizes 150 class 27 adding that combo

110
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.240
box to our frame.

111
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.190
After that, defining the string to which will be used for destination.

112
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.310
Defining another combo box.

113
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.880
Bypassing the string array.

114
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.830
Setting bond for the combo box.

115
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:51.510
Which location is 500, 100 and its sizes 150 class 27 adding that combo box to over j frame.

116
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.960
Then we have defined rear axle snow for the button show.

117
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:06.280
Inside which we have defined the method action performed, which is taken the argument as action event

118
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.400
inside the try block.

119
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:15.550
We have fetched the source from the combo box of source and destination from the combo.

120
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.890
Box of destination.

121
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.630
Now created the connection object of the connection class.

122
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.530
See.

123
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:36.070
Define the string str query select string form reservation where source is equals to s, r, c and destination

124
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.420
is equals to DST.

125
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.920
IRS will execute the query passed.

126
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.380
In it, which is still a string.

127
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.460
If I start next will iterate over the.

128
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.790
Results of.

129
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:57.840
The.

130
00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.950
Record.

131
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.720
It will trade over the record of the resolution.

132
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.200
Let me change it to.

133
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.000
Wait a minute.

134
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.930
Let me have a look on flight info class.

135
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.850
It's a.

136
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.320
Execute query and tailor set.

137
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.060
Sure.

138
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.450
Let me remove this.

139
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.980
This if statement is not needed as we have not to.

140
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.320
Match anything will be removing that bracket as well.

141
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.440
Otherwise, it will show better.

142
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.550
Uh.

143
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.950
Now.

144
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.160
Here.

145
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.580
We will be removing this for some time as well.

146
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.230
Let me highlight this.

147
00:11:59.370 --> 00:11:59.940
Yes.

148
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.800
Now it will show.

149
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.250
So the that model will set the model of the table.

150
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.770
Now, this will handle the exception.

151
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:12.480
If any occurs, a new table defines setting the bound for it, adding it to table.

152
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.950
A scroll panel for the table.

153
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.300
Setting the bound for the table.

154
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.460
Background color as white and adding it to our panel.

155
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.450
Setting the size of the window.

156
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.860
8860 600.

157
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.750
Location is four in Red Cross 200.

158
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.490
And the visibility of the current window is to let's have a look at running of this.

159
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.690
So let me run this.

160
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:40.440
So this is how it will look like if I chose anything like from partner but not to Delhi.

161
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.990
Let's see what happens here.

162
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.070
So it is showing now I have added the data in my database.

163
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.340
So that is showing from the information.

164
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.990
So this is the information.

165
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.190
Let's close it.

166
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:06.210
So this is about the journey data class and we will be learning about the last two classes in our next

167
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:06.780
video.
