1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.700
So in a switch case.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.390
Then the case zero.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.900
That means a user have pressed the zero button so we have to quit.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.950
Right away to print this line which says playlist is complete and it will be the set to true so that

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.780
we don't have to further.

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.110
To do our steps.

7
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.810
And after that, we have to break now.

8
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:37.820
Now, the next case could be is one could be what it says it sees it have to play the next song.

9
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.540
Right.

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.920
So here.

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.630
We need.

12
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.170
And if a statement, if not forward if not forward, that means of forward is false.

13
00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:00.890
And we have to also charge that if list at Twitter dot has next not previous so we have to check the

14
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:09.050
next not previous since we have instructed to play the next song and we have to even check the next

15
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.710
song exist or not if the next song exist.

16
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.190
If some exist.

17
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.060
And then we have to show our list.

18
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.720
A traitor.

19
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.260
So list.

20
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.160
Traitor.

21
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.930
Not next.

22
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.570
Simple as that.

23
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.910
And what we know is here, we will set forward equal to be the truth this time.

24
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.180
And what we do is we have to now print the song.

25
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.680
In the song that we have in here.

26
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.280
And so what we do is outside this is a statement.

27
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.100
We do another statement, not outside this.

28
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.080
Mr..

29
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.820
That we have said.

30
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.940
Forward to it.

31
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.750
True.

32
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.810
And yes, outside this list, Prater.

33
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:14.310
We checked for other efforts that if listed crater not has next next to the shore and after that we

34
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.420
will print whatever the current listed critter is on.

35
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.470
So it is ennobling and whatever is supposition of illustrator.

36
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.600
So illustrator dot next and we have to convert it to string and that's it.

37
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.440
And at the same time, not at the same time.

38
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.050
We have not checked for the last part.

39
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.810
What we can do is there is no no next song, no next song available.

40
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.450
So that means we have reached to the end of the list.

41
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.130
So no song.

42
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.420
No song available.

43
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.160
Reach to the end of the list.

44
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.720
And we'll set forward to whether false so forward or not for.

45
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.860
For Vincent, we be false here.

46
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.620
So here we have Randall zero.

47
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.770
And the one piece which was to quit and to play the next button.

48
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.460
So when the user presses to now here we have to what we have to do we have to play the previous song.

49
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.320
This one case too.

50
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.180
We have to play the previous song.

51
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.310
So let's break out of this first and we will break this here.

52
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.080
And what we do is when the case is two, so that in case we do here, we have another statement.

53
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.030
If straight forward is true here, the forward will be the true and we have to change the end of the

54
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.410
previous exist.

55
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.220
Then shift our pointer on the list.

56
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.220
In the previous telestrator that has previous.

57
00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:00.260
So we have to check this list because let's say we are on the first song, we are on the first song.

58
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.620
Then in that case we don't have any previous song.

59
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.430
So we have to check that if the previous songs exist, then the list operator.

60
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.830
Two previous end forward will be set to the fall.

61
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:28.720
So outside this statement forward is equal to the falls and what we do outside if the list is greater.

62
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.150
Yeah.

63
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.540
If the literature metadata has previous just to ensure and what we do is we have to print whatever the

64
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.980
current sonnet is.

65
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.420
So nothing.

66
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.050
No not playing and the song is listed or not previous and we have converted to string.

67
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.530
Yes.

68
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.470
Like this two string.

69
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.790
And in that last part we have to handle that.

70
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.600
We are the first song here so there is no previous song.

71
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.610
So we are right.

72
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.210
The first song like this we can say we are at the first song.

73
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.440
And what we do is set forward to the falls and breakout so forward and we'll set it to the fall so like

74
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.420
this and we will break here.

75
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.190
And the next thing is we have handled zero one and two.

76
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.670
So the next thing that we have to handle is to replay the current zone.

77
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:32.490
So let's say it's the case three and we have to check that we are eligible for forward OC.

78
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:40.760
If we are eligible for forward, then we have to shift to if list operator not has previous.

79
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.940
Since pointer is shifted, we have to move to the previous.

80
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:51.980
So in that case, if the list that has previous that has previous, we will simply print that whatever

81
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.710
the song it is because it's our previous song.

82
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:05.090
So now playing and the name of the song, which is the less know which will be the last operator that

83
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:14.900
previous and will convert the string like the to string and we'll set forward to be to the false and

84
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:22.790
what we can do in that part we can see that we are at the start of the list inspired part will simply

85
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.030
print that we are at the start of list like this and just from dot dot print.

86
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.850
And now what we can do is now we need another else.

87
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.570
BLOCK this else block here.

88
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.460
Let's define everything here.

89
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:51.530
Now if list creator dot has next and this time if this has next, then we simply print.

90
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.470
So now playing in the current song.

91
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:03.540
So let's try Twitter dot next and we have to print it so we will convert it to string and forward will

92
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:12.160
set to the true again so for not for all is equal to two here and here in that case.

93
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.270
Now, if that's not so, what we will do is we will simply print that we have reached the end of the

94
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:24.440
list in the last part like this and simply break out of this case as well.

95
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.680
So out of this, if else, block will break the.

96
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:35.580
So we have handled case three as well when we have to replace the current song now now the case for.

97
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.740
We have to print all the songs.

98
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.070
So when the cases for what we do is we will print the list.

99
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.860
So here we have created a matter which will print all the songs inside the playlist.

100
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:54.590
So we will simply not print my new print list.

101
00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:03.410
And here we have to pass in the link to list this playlist telling list, which is although we have

102
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.710
handled the four case as well.

103
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:14.750
Now when the case when you press five, we have to first record of this.

104
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:22.630
This is four as well and we have to know when the case is five and we have to print all the available

105
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.450
options.

106
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.410
Right.

107
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.820
We have to.

108
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.940
Yeah.

109
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.150
The 15 sprint all available options.

110
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:39.070
So the menu here and the code will call the print menu and break out of this block.

111
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.680
And now the last case is the case six.

112
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.440
Here we have to remove or delete the current zone that we are on.

113
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.880
If there is no such so that means it's okay.

114
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.080
We have to do this.

115
00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.380
And when the song exists in our playlist, so playlist and that dies.

116
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:06.160
If that thing is greater than zero, then only we can delete items from the playlist.

117
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:16.790
What do we do if list creator dot has next to and okay if the list or does not extend, it will appear

118
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.890
before that we will remove.

119
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:26.700
Whatever the current iterator is on also list iterator dot remove.

120
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:34.310
The Socialist to a traitor has next to.

121
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:40.340
So for example, if we have deleted the current song, then we have to.

122
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.920
Play the next song or not.

123
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.740
So we have to check that the next song even exist or not.

124
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.180
So if listed Prater dot has nine and what we will do is simply print.

125
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.620
We will print now playing and the name of the song.

126
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:06.270
So list Twitter the list Twitter next and it will convert to the string.

127
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:13.680
So since we have removed the current song, so by default it will either print or either play the next

128
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.120
song or the previous song.

129
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.530
And at the same time we'll set forward with True.

130
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:23.890
Yeah.

131
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.130
So I found that to be true.

132
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.730
And if there is no next song.

133
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.430
Or the please.

134
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.030
Then we have to handle the case.

135
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.040
This one, Dale's case.

136
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.500
Right.

137
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:48.470
Okay, let's have one more check that even if the previous song existed right or not.

138
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.610
So if Lestrade did not, has previous.

139
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.680
We have to only do this when we have the previous.

140
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.180
So what we.

141
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.830
Okay.

142
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.230
Make sure header it will have the return.

143
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.860
Di fried.

144
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:11.860
We don't have to sit forward to wade through the playlists.

145
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.370
Creator.

146
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:21.280
Okay, so if the playlist was okay, so in the previous song, so now playing and whatever the name

147
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.110
of the song is, so let's do Twitter dot previous start to string.

148
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:31.390
So here is our case for and I we don't need any more cases.

149
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.590
So what we have done, we had defined all the cases here.

150
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:42.220
So we have taken the user input and defined some of the booleans

151
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.760
in the list.

152
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.900
Iterator.

153
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.650
Yeah.

154
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:53.200
So in the conclusion and we have taken the user input and defined some of the booleans, then we have

155
00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:01.480
the list of iterator for list and if the list of the size of the list is zero, simply print that we

156
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:08.200
don't have any song and print on the level of programming print menu.

157
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.230
So why not quit while users have not quit yet?

158
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:17.230
Take user input and use these switch cases and all the different cases.

159
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.300
For example, we have this.

160
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.430
No, yeah.

161
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.720
Let's see the example as well.

162
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.130
This one here.

163
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.980
Right.

164
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.280
I'm simply running our program here.

165
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.550
We will have to.

166
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:48.600
Yeah, we will simply take the example and press zero.

167
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.350
It sees playlist complete and we just quit.

168
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.490
So we have defined all the food cases.
