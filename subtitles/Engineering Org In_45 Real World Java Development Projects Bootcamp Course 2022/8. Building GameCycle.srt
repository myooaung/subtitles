1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,510
Inside this removal lines matter.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,980
Firstly, we have to check if there is any fold room among all rows in the board.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,040
If there is at least one full line, it is removed.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,430
So after finding a full line, we increase the counter.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,010
We move all the lines above the full row.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,210
One line down.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,890
This way we can destroy the whole line in order to escape.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,080
We use so-called gravity.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,520
This means that the squares may be left floating above empty gaps.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:40,780
So in this matter, we will write in the NUM four lines and set it to zero.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,500
And we need another for loop.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:51,070
And here we write an equal to good height minus one.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,090
And then we need a greater than equal to zero.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,650
Set it to.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,100
And here we need the element of the I.

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:10,380
I decreased and we need boolean blindness for this one.

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,090
Okay.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,440
Just second line is full.

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,060
So I could do the true need the true.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,170
And this is John.

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,180
We need another for loop.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,060
This one and we need another four which needs the integer g said to the zero.

23
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,320
JS Let's turn to the board with.

24
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,030
Here.

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,590
We need the chain agreement here.

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:53,680
And what we will do, we will check with the conditions if she at G meet her need.

27
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:02,620
J Comma, no di comma j j i is equal to that terminal dot no shape.

28
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,320
It's done.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,170
And we need Linus to set it to the false here.

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,400
It's done.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,050
And then we have to break.

32
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,050
Okay.

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,690
So here we have done this thing.

34
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,020
And after words, we need another condition.

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,490
So we will write.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:34,640
If so, if line is full, you will check with this condition and then we will increase it.

37
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,160
So now four lines plus.

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,560
And then what we have to do?

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,490
If there is at least one foul line, it is removed.

40
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,970
Right.

41
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:57,820
So here we will do with the new one and for loop and here we will say in K equal to I and K should be

42
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:05,830
less than to board height and minus one and k should plus plus.

43
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:16,780
And this is done and we need another for loop and say in g equal to zero and g should be less than the

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,140
board width and this is run and need the incremental.

45
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,840
And here we will see board.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,580
Need to need this one multiplied with the bold word.

47
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,080
And then we add J here.

48
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,300
And what do we have to do?

49
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,540
Equal to shape and height.

50
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:48,290
And here we will see G and here it set it to the cube plus one.

51
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,570
So all this is done here.

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,710
This thing is done.

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,910
Come out of this loop and we need one more condition.

54
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,900
If no lines is greater than zero, then do another thing.

55
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,220
We have to remove the lines.

56
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,700
Right.

57
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,010
So we will write

58
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,180
no lines.

59
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:22,180
Remove clause equal to no lines.

60
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,390
So not four lines and then 32.

61
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,080
And then we need the status bar and it should set text.

62
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,620
We need a trim, not value off, and it should set long lines removed.

63
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,130
So we have to set the is following finished variable to that.

64
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,700
True.

65
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,280
So set it to the true here.

66
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,920
Tony.

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:01,360
We need it to the truth and we need the current piece and it should set shape.

68
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,150
And here it will go through the terminal door.

69
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,010
No --.

70
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,050
This thing is done.

71
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,670
Now we have to go with the new draw square.

72
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,630
We have not created that method, so we will create here.

73
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,000
We need another method which will be a draw square method.

74
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,480
Every Tetris piece has four squares.

75
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,990
Each of these squares is drawn with the draw square method.

76
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,700
So we need another method named as the draw square.

77
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:44,990
So we will write private void draw square here and give the parameters to graphics.

78
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:57,500
G coma in x coma in my coma and certain to terminal shape.

79
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,080
It's done.

80
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,960
And here we have to give the colors.

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,810
Whatever you have to give, you can get.

82
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,990
So we will do color colors.

83
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,460
We need spectrometers.

84
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:23,480
So we set new color and give the 000.

85
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,460
We need new color and give the parameter.

86
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,480
Whatever you want to do.

87
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,370
What?

88
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,430
What do you wish?

89
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,260
You can give it.

90
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,640
And I will give on my own.

91
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,400
And here we have to.

92
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,860
Do the same things, but you have to change some colors.

93
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,680
And so copy paste, copy, paste, same as it is.

94
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,320
It's.

95
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,790
These are the seven shapes colours.

96
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,440
So.

97
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,080
It is of no shape and neither for the others.

98
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,360
So we will change.

99
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,870
You can change this.

100
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,180
What we are to do.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,680
It's done here.

102
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,850
Now what?

103
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,900
We have every space of seven different colors.

104
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,650
Right, left on the top side of the square are drawn with a brighter color.

105
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:31,110
Similarly, the bottom and the right sides are drawn with the darker colors to tell with the 3D edge.

106
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,580
So you can do that.

107
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,080
So I will set the color here so brighter and.

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,380
Right.

109
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,050
So we have to go with the.

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,030
Okay.

111
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,490
100 to 1.

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,470
Then we will go meet this.

113
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,180
102 comma 204102.

114
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,890
Here, here we will write

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,050
1021102.

116
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,710
The brighter and the darker.

117
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,270
Right?

118
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,800
So this should be seen

119
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:21,070
204102 here and here should be 1021204204.

120
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:29,240
Here and here we will write 2181730.

121
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,390
And here we have to change it to 102204.

122
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:55,970
So now we will call no variable color equal to color shape third ordinal and third this G.

123
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,670
So set color.

124
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,270
And we need give it the parameter to the color and its tone.

125
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,180
And we have to not fill.

126
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,720
We need the red matter.

127
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:18,380
And here we will get the X plus one plus one.

128
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,690
It will be the.

129
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,890
Right.

130
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,250
So it should be worth.

131
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,840
Return.

132
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,240
It should be minus two and comma and under.

133
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,540
Really be this height.

134
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,090
Minus two.

135
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,910
It's done.

136
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,570
Then we need set colour again.

137
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,710
Think.

138
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

139
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,160
We should do that later.

140
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,080
Okay.

141
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,540
So we need another thing.

142
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,540
We have to write set color.

143
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,280
And here we have, right?

144
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:28,110
The color dot brighter, the brighter.

145
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,700
So here it's done.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,560
We tried to draw the line, so we knew the line.

147
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,410
Whether X or Y should be the no.

148
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,550
Why should we add the square height here?

149
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,200
So we need the square.

150
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,550
Right.

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,170
But it should be subtracted with the minus one and x or y should be the same.

152
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,600
And we will copy this.

153
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,230
And again press enter pasted and change it with the here.

154
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,840
It should be the same.

155
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,500
Right.

156
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,870
It should course with the.

157
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,940
But one.

158
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:20,290
Nathan It should be X or Y, but it should be added with the x value, not the Y value.

159
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,980
So we will write x plus this one.

160
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,710
So it's done now we will do it.

161
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,870
Same for the brighter one.

162
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,980
Simply copy this and paste this and change it to the darker type.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,720
Darker.

164
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:46,450
And here we will go with the x plus one Y plus squared minus one.

165
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,620
But here it should be x plus a square.

166
00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:00,360
Square root subtracted to the one, and here it will be five plus

167
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,490
height and less than to the one here.

168
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,540
And for another one, it should go.

169
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,170
Okay.

170
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:18,840
We will copy this c and change it to this and added something.

171
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,000
We will lose x plus a square root here.

172
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,720
So we will write X plus square in the square root here.

173
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,110
So we will try to square ten minus one and it should be.

174
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,610
VI is glad, but here should be the height.

175
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:55,740
It should be the height here and drill the miners and then x we need so we need X plus we need the word

176
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,100
here.

177
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:06,020
Okay, so with time then minus one and then another parameter will be the Y plus one and it's done.

178
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,160
So here we have done.

179
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,790
Now we have to create the game cycle method.

180
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,100
I think we had created it earlier.

181
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,940
It's not then we have to create it again.

182
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,870
This one, this class, we have to create this class.

183
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,010
You need that.

184
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,720
So what we will do?

185
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,430
We have to write.

186
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,330
We have to write private class.

187
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,950
Game cycle.

188
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,470
We should implement.

189
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:47,950
Okay.

190
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,190
Action listener.

191
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,750
Under this map, we will override some methods.

192
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,640
What should be?

193
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,970
It should override the action perform method.

194
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:07,130
So we will hear in this game cycle we call the do game cycle method also to creating a game cycle.

195
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:16,010
So firstly, we will override the action perform method to we have to write public void action.

196
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,730
But from.

197
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,250
Okay.

198
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,130
I should have even done so.

199
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:35,460
Even under this, we will right over my third duty cycle here.

200
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,690
And it's done its name as I do game cycle and the game cycle.

201
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,100
Plus we call the game cycle matter to create a game cycle.

202
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:57,540
So under this we will go and we have to create this matter here.

203
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,420
Now we have to write its bodies.

204
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:07,440
Firstly, we have to we need to update one and the repeat here.

205
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,130
So the game is divided into game cycles.

206
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,220
A cycle updates a game and redraws the board.

207
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,780
So for the update one we need, we have to see the body.

208
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,900
So create a update and into this update.

209
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,720
Now it represents one step of the game.

210
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,750
The following piece goes one line down or a new piece is created and the previous one is finished following.

211
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:45,330
So what we have to write, if we have to first check if it is post this post and then return, it should

212
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,000
return simply afterwards.

213
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,530
It should check if it's following finished.

214
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:01,770
Then it said it's following finished variable to top false so equal to false.

215
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:11,010
And then we will call our new piece method here and it will create the new piece or else what can we

216
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,760
do?

217
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,920
We need another method which we have created.

218
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,020
It should be the one line done.

219
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:27,120
This one afterwards we have created the we have to create another class which we have used here.

220
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,850
I think the de and after this one, this one, the de and after.

221
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,660
So we have to create this class as well.

222
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,370
So what should we do now?

223
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,740
We will create class.

224
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,800
Sorry.

225
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,460
Private class.

226
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,460
Being an after.

227
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,870
And to an extent.

228
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,240
And it's and after this, the game is controlled with a cursor keys.

229
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,160
We check for key events in the key.

230
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,620
So here we will.

231
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,450
This will be our last stand.

232
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,930
So we will override the matter key.

233
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:27,740
So we will call our master key pressed here and we provide the key event with name E and into this we

234
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,900
will check for some condition.

235
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,810
If current piece not get shape.

236
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,770
Is equal to the

237
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,340
that owned or no shape.

238
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,420
If there is no shape, then simply return.

239
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,000
Or else.

240
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,470
No.

241
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,960
Yeah.

242
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,410
We don't need anything else.

243
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:05,000
So after this, we will create another variable key code and set it to the.

244
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:17,760
Erin TONER I think we need to get key that key goal, the key goal of pressing key.

245
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,300
So what we need some switch statement.

246
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,710
So here we will use the Java switch expressions.

247
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,870
Through here what we will do.

248
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,660
We need switch.

249
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,750
Check it for the key code here.

250
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:44,040
This one, I think we get the key here with the get key code method.

251
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:49,120
Then with the Java 12 switch expression, we bind key events to methods.

252
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,380
For instance, with the space key, we draw down the following Tetris piece.

253
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,520
So here this will be our last step in this class.

254
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,070
So we will create the case.

255
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,960
Keys.

256
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,540
Kieran.

257
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:10,030
Ian Lord, we need to.

258
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,060
We.

259
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,650
Me, me, me.

260
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,350
It should be this one.

261
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,800
P simply goose.

262
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,980
It should be passed.

263
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,190
We will settle our cases here.

264
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:45,320
Copy paste paste will change this here.

265
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,270
The key moment when we needed the left one.

266
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,840
We need the next here.

267
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,580
This one.

268
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,080
It should call the prime move method.

269
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,160
Current pace and the cold.

270
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:15,600
Here goes the current x -132, and here the key code goes with the current Y.

271
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,030
And here it should be.

272
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,150
Here it will call the right one.

273
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,620
This one.

274
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,870
Not sure.

275
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,410
Gonna try.

276
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,300
Move.

277
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:43,350
Current piece, but it goes with the current x value which should add with one year and.

278
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,280
This will change it for the.

279
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,710
Got it right.

280
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,220
And here we go.

281
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,770
The left turn right when you score.

282
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,320
It goes with the down one.

283
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,580
We need to down one.

284
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,470
And here we need the upper one.

285
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,450
Here, this one and another one, which you really need is the space.

286
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,580
And the last one which we need is that one line down.

287
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,610
Here and we don't need any of that.

288
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,860
So what we do, we will call it dry move.

289
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,850
Sorry.

290
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,490
We need to dry move again.

291
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,870
Try.

292
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,830
Move

293
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,770
here, what we will do for them downwards.

294
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,410
We will set the current pace.

295
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,080
But it should rotate.

296
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,470
Right?

297
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,600
Comma.

298
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,880
Current X.

299
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,050
Comma.

300
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,480
Current Y.

301
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,980
And this is done.

302
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,420
Another thing which we need for the upper one.

303
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,370
We need to try move it.

304
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:20,260
Should current base not rotate left and here we need a current X in the current y.

305
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:30,000
Here is one current tax and this will be rectified here and here.

306
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,150
We need for the space to drop down a third and d for the one line down.

307
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,590
This one.
