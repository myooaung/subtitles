00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.340
In this video, we will be talking about our first file, which is CAD account or Java file.

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.940
This file will be counting the words and characters which will user enter in the text area.

3
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.900
So let's have a look what how this is working.

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.380
So this class is defined inside the package apps and we have imported the necessary packages like Java

5
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.780
District, which is Abstract Window Toolkit.

6
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.910
This package will be used to provide a better graphical user interface.

7
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.140
And then we have used the Java export swing, while Java export swing package is a modified version

8
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.700
of the Abstract Window Toolkit.

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.990
So we will also use this to provide graphical user interface and.

10
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.920
Then we have imported Java dot ADA Dot event which will help us to perform event or handle events over

11
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
the buttons which we will be using in this class.

12
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.400
After that, we have defined here a public class count which is extending frame and implementing action,

13
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.780
where frame is a class provided by the Swing Framework and Excel is not the interface which will help

14
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.290
us to implement its methods for the handling events on our buttons.

15
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.410
After that, there are two labels, L1 and L2.

16
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.490
That is a jailable type of instance.

17
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.290
Then there is a text area instance to and a button type of instance b and there are two more buttons,

18
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.490
pad and text.

19
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.180
So these are the instance which is inside this account class.

20
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.500
After that we have defined the non parameterized constructor of this class inside which we have first

21
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.620
inside super variable.

22
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.320
We have stated that care word count tool.

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.850
So this will be the heading which is cat character word counting tool.

24
00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.230
After that we have initialized the label LWB one is equals to new J label and we have passed the argument

25
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.370
test characters.

26
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.180
So this label will be used to show the number of characters.

27
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.750
And after that for this label we have set its location and size.

28
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.930
So its location will be 50, comma, 50, and it's a size will be 100 cross 20.

29
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.910
So the first two argument will be X and Y.

30
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.560
So these will be the location.

31
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.110
And the second argument is width and height.

32
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.900
So it will be hundred and its height will be 20.

33
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.770
Similarly, we have defined another label, LWB two is equals two new label and passed the argument

34
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.790
as words.

35
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.730
So this will store and print the number of words.

36
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.000
And after that we have set the location and size for that label by using the set bounce method.

37
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.770
And we have passed that to argument.

38
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.680
First to argument will be X and Y, so it is 50, comma, 80, and after that its size will be 100 cross

39
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.000
20, same as the label one size, which is for the characters.

40
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.090
After that we have defined the text area.

41
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.560
Variability is equal to new text area with no arguments and then we have defined a scroll panel for

42
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.370
that text area.

43
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.840
So that is a scroll pane variable ESP, new scroll pen and past the text area and as our argument to

44
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.130
the scroll pane.

45
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.860
So what it is, does it basically apply the scroll panel over the text area as the text area instance

46
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.370
has been passed inside the argument of the scroll panel.

47
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:34.150
After that, we have set the bound for the scroll panel and its location will be 50 comma one 110 and

48
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.710
it's the size will be 300.

49
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.760
Cross 200.

50
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:45.740
After that we have defined a button b is equals to new j button and pass the argument as count so this

51
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.440
button will be labeled labelled as count.

52
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.120
So when we will want to count the number of characters and button, we will press this button.

53
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.600
After that, we have set the bound for this button using a set bounce method.

54
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.240
The first two arguments will be and by location from which the button will be placed.

55
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.540
So it will be placed at 50 comma 320 and its a size will be eight cross 30.

56
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.750
So this will be the bound or location for that button and eight across 30 will be the size of the button.

57
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.740
After that we have added action listener to this button because some event must be performed as it is

58
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.100
a button.

59
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.980
So when it will be pressed, so something must be performed for that.

60
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.210
We have added listener and after that we will define its action, perform the event as well.

61
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.930
Then there is another button named as pad, so new button pad colour.

62
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.200
So this will be labelled as pad colour.

63
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.990
By clicking this button we can change.

64
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.310
The colour of our text stadia background and also the text.

65
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.910
So we will be showing this in output, how it is working.

66
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.350
Then we have set the set bounds of for that pad button.

67
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.200
Its location will be 140, comma 320.

68
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.310
So it will be located at 140 comer 320 and it's the size will be one 110 cross 30.

69
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.690
So this will be its size.

70
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.420
And as here it is written also X, Y and width, height.

71
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.080
So these are the respective values for the said bounds.

72
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.130
After that we have added action is now on the pad button also because Pad Button will also handle events

73
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.210
whenever it is clicked.

74
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.700
So it should perform something whenever any event must be occurring in this button.

75
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.080
After that, we have defined another label as text color.

76
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.390
So bad color will be changing for the changing of color of the background of the text area.

77
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.200
While the text color will help us to change the color of the text, which we will be writing on that

78
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.040
text area.

79
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.920
So this button is labeled as text color.

80
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.650
After that, we have set the bound for that button.

81
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:58.240
Which will help us to locate the button and set its size so its location will be to 6320 and its size

82
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.440
will be 1102110 across 30.

83
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.850
This will be its size after that.

84
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.890
We have added action to that button because the button must be performing some event whenever it is

85
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.460
pressed.

86
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.000
After that, what we are doing is we are adding the LP one to our frame.

87
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.630
Similarly, we are adding LP two, then we are writing the scroll panel and all the three buttons be

88
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.530
pad and text.

89
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.740
So we have added everything to our frame.

90
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.750
After that, we are setting the size of the frame that will be 400, comma, four and 400, cross 400,

91
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.520
then its layout as null.

92
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.560
So we will be not using any layout manager and set the visibility of the window as true.

93
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.320
After that, we have set the default close operation or dispose on clause.

94
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.670
So whenever we will close.

95
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.510
So this will.

96
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.840
Close the complete program and operation.

97
00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.890
After that, we have defined the action performed method which is taking argument action event e.

98
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.890
So this method will be handling events over those buttons, which we have defined to be pad and text.

99
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.330
So here it is.

100
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.070
There is a statement inside which we have passed e dot get sources is close to be.

101
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.110
So if the source of the button is b that b button is for basically count.

102
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.540
As you can see, the B button is for count.

103
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.270
So if the source of the event is from B, what we are doing is we are setting a string text is equals

104
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.710
to to get text.

105
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.890
So we are fetching the text from the text area and storing it into a string named as text.

106
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.930
After that.

107
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.680
What we are doing.

108
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.250
We are.

109
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:50.330
We are setting the that setting some text in our label one and what the argument is characters and we

110
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.730
are adding a string text dot length.

111
00:07:52.730 --> 00:08:00.110
So as we have restored the text area value in the text, so we'll be simply calculating the length of

112
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.670
that text.

113
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.430
So that text length will be provide us the.

114
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:14.770
Number of characters in our return a string or data which we have written inside the text area.

115
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:22.360
After that, what we are doing is we are in initializing a string type of header words inside which

116
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.160
we are splitting our text with the help of a.

117
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.720
Backslash se.

118
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.150
So this will be for the space.

119
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:39.400
So we were splitting our text on the basis of space because words will be calculated at every space.

120
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.210
So whenever it is found the space, it will split it and store it into an area.

121
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.000
Now, inside the lab to what we are doing, setting the text words is equals to words total length.

122
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.810
So now we will be calculating the length of that area.

123
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.710
So that will be the number of words.

124
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.320
So we have stored that thing in our label.

125
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.870
Two now inside the LCF if the resource of the button is from pad.

126
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:09.130
If the pad button is pressed or an event happened, then what we are doing is we are opening a colour

127
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:17.760
C and the J colour chooser and dots show dialog box this colour choose colour and colour dot black.

128
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:23.800
So this is the argument or the colour user will help us to open a colour chooser which will help us

129
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:32.050
to choose different colours and we have stored that C in colour object class.

130
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:38.200
After that what we are doing is we are setting the background colour to set background and past that

131
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.730
particular chosen colour.

132
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.490
So that's what this will do.

133
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.810
This will change the background colour of our text area as soon as any colour will be chosen from this

134
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:47.800
dialog box.

135
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.400
Now if the source of the baton is from text.

136
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.520
So what we are doing, if the source of the baton is from text, that color C is equals to GE color

137
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.610
chooser stat dot show dialog box and this choose colors color not black.

138
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:11.040
So this will also help us to choose color from a dialog box with the help of the color chooser class.

139
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:18.490
And what we are doing is we are setting the foreground color of the text area as I see the chosen color.

140
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:26.360
So this will change the color of the text or the content which we will be writing in the text area to

141
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.420
the color which will be chosen by the user.

142
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:35.290
So that's how the color count is working inside which we have also studied about that changing the colors

143
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.560
of the background of the text area as well as its foreground.

144
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:44.990
So this will also help us to change the background color and the text of the fonts which we will be

145
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.970
writing now inside the main function.

146
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.050
What we did is just simply call the new account class so that whenever it is.

147
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.650
It will, it should be run.

148
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.700
So a main method will be called and it will create the instance for that.

149
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.940
Current class.

150
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:05.300
So that's how the current class is working, which will be counting the words and characters written

151
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.420
in.
