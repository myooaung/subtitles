00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.850
In previous part, what I created a thread which is using the animal interface I'm mentioning.

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.860
I mentioned here in the keep going part I created each and everything with the right message.

3
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.690
I'm going to write that message and chat message for the purpose who is in for the who is in each and

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.140
etc.?

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.770
Everything.

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.160
So I need to mention close method also to close everything.

7
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.600
So.

8
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.840
Moses and King.

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.720
But this part and I will delete this post.

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.840
So as you can see.

11
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.490
This is done, basically.

12
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.340
Now I need to create one right message.

13
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.420
But also you're.

14
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.560
And wait a minute.

15
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.870
There is grandpa, basically.

16
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.020
Okay.

17
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.040
Well for the nose.

18
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.840
This is for the keep going.

19
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.430
This is for the run.

20
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.350
So keep going.

21
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.070
Should be ended first, as I told you.

22
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.920
So let me do one thing.

23
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.940
Keep going is NZ first.

24
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.660
You can see the switch cases in the first.

25
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.570
Then after keep going.

26
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.660
Oh, then.

27
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.650
Let me do one thing here.

28
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.890
This is for Solway.

29
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.010
Check your loops, because I'm just using this part.

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.120
Keep going, isn't it?

31
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.310
And after that, keep going, isn't it?

32
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.690
I need to lose that trading part also.

33
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.690
Not at all.

34
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.650
Okay.

35
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.910
So I created already keep doing each and every thing.

36
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.740
And now this training part and this is basically my class part.

37
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.660
So what I'm creating do and created all the things and I'm executing that part.

38
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.240
It will that closing part, it will be directly throwing that user out of that server part.

39
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.760
So this is done.

40
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.450
Now, what required thing is here?

41
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.040
We need to create a one right message method here.

42
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.170
So this is my right to message method, which is basically writing that part inside boolean with connected.

43
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.790
If the connected try that writing message error in the sending message if there is an error.

44
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.070
So these are all about server part.

45
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.390
Now we are required some, as I told you, using log log in, get message each and everything inside

46
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.620
chat message.

47
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.200
So let me go with the chat message.

48
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.210
Chat message is very simple.

49
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.870
Thing.

50
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.640
Let me import one thing.

51
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.780
Import Java.

52
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.110
Dot start because it's very important.

53
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:41.360
But now what is required things is this class is defines the different types of messages that will be

54
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.800
what we can say exchange between clients and server.

55
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.230
So let me mention.

56
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.810
Though specified this class will.

57
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.640
But a form.

58
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.350
For.

59
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.220
Different type of.

60
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.080
Messages.

61
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.420
Again.

62
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.920
Then second thing is, when talking from Java client to Java server, it is a lot easier to pass objects.

63
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.200
No need to count bytes then wait.

64
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.410
Then line and feeds by each frame and frame.

65
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.430
What you can do.

66
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.330
You can create and parse that full object inside the frame.

67
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.860
So.

68
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.190
These are easier to pass wall.

69
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.110
Object.

70
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.930
Instead.

71
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.600
Of byte stream.

72
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.190
Frame of PCP.

73
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.860
So if I am mentioning here is I'm creating I already created message.

74
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.810
So I'm going with this.

75
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.150
So different types of messages, as I told you.

76
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.100
So these are the different ways in message, which is ordering text message and logout.

77
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.340
So let me put that message here.

78
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.220
So let me tell you what is this basically title is for type who is in message and logo to each and everything.

79
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.030
So if you showing the green line, you can save that dictionary pattern.

80
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.760
And so these are all the private things.

81
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.950
You cannot change this here.

82
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.470
So let me create one constructor here.

83
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.790
Procter.

84
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.290
To basically chat message.

85
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.840
Inside that message.

86
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.300
What I'm going to mention is here is pipe and string, message and type.

87
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.740
Joining.

88
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.530
Message.

89
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:54.120
So I already created this, then this type to this type, if you know how you can assign that to that

90
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.690
part.

91
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.470
Then this dot message.

92
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.540
Difficult to message.

93
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.490
So these are all the things you can do.

94
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.780
Now, what is required to this year is get type and all the things you need to create here.

95
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.150
So get type.

96
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.780
This is basically mental.

97
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.590
Britain.

98
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.390
I.

99
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.330
Now what is remaining more remaining thing easier is we get the message, string get message.

100
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.440
Done message.

101
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.460
So this is how you can do.

102
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.750
Now you can see.

103
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.700
There is no errors.

104
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.220
There are some warnings here, but there are no errors inside our server class as I already created

105
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.940
this part.

106
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.960
Let me save this part and save this part.

107
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.100
So now our server, we can run that server if you want.

108
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.250
You can check also.

109
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.410
Let me do something here.

110
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.150
Let me run the server.

111
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.120
Ransomware.

112
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.410
So it will run that part.

113
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.110
As you can see, it is building.

114
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.110
And it is running and tasked each and everything.

115
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.150
So it will take time to compile each and every part here, but it's building.

116
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.460
Now our server program is running.

117
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.240
So in that program you can say at this time times timestamp.

118
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.550
My server is waiting for the client.

119
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.610
It's on board this.

120
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.640
So I will explain what is the boat and each and everything.

121
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.070
So now our server program is live.

122
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.090
You can say at this time our server program is like.

123
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.520
Well, you know, for their part, I'm going to tell you how we can do this stuff.

124
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.240
Our client and client Java.

125
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.700
Again, it will be very simple code, but it will take time for each and every part.

126
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.890
So I already created this part.

127
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.040
So let me use that part most time.

128
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.540
Only vaguely.

129
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.340
So I will explain this client message.

130
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.030
So what is the client message here?

131
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.310
Is it will ask for me the different parts here.

132
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.670
First is the client or notify purpose?

133
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.310
Is input for that?

134
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.410
Is input output for that purpose?

135
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.770
Socket is for the socket.

136
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.050
Private string server plus user name and the get user name for the username.

137
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.820
Set username for the set username.

138
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.750
I'm invoking this part for the setting username each and everything.

139
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.660
And this is, as you can see, start is method for that purpose to create that socket and put in that

140
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.590
socket.

141
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.460
Listen from server creates a thread to listener server and your username will be sent there.

142
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.220
I exception is for the purposes.

143
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.180
So these are all the things send message for the sending message disconnect for the disconnecting from

144
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.600
that message, exception each and everything similar like this.

145
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.790
Now this is very important what I'm stating.

146
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.960
The port number is 1500.

147
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.720
Or we can say 1500.

148
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.230
Why I'm using this port only because server is on that port.

149
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.270
If you want to change this port, you can change it.

150
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:29.420
You can change the number four digit number with 0 to 9 digits.

151
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.350
You can change that.

152
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.260
Again, this is localhost string username.

153
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.580
Default is anonymous.

154
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:40.580
If you want to input, you can input that and you can scan it and directly put that in this.

155
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.050
Argument, as I told you.

156
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:51.010
Case three If the debt length is greater than three Java client, use an import numbers or address in

157
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.240
each and everything part.

158
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.810
If what is invalid, it will be the invalid part.

159
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.950
Similarly, it will put that.

160
00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.360
Hello.

161
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.130
Welcome to chatroom instructions.

162
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.290
It will print first instruction or you can space this username.

163
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.940
Your message here is that you can create within for it is all the instructions here.

164
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.780
And I create the login and logout method.

165
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:20.190
Then again, I need to create thread here and this is basically that what you can say this from this

166
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.750
part and each and everything I can.

167
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.390
So let me turn first.

168
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.190
The server.

169
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.200
So first you need to run the server and if you want to check more clients, as you can see, I can run

170
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.430
only one client here.

171
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.800
But if you want to run more clients, you need to use one plugin inside ID which is basically multi

172
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.160
run.

173
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.340
I tell you how we are going to do that stuff also.

174
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.680
So let me run here.

175
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.990
My client.

176
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:54.570
Also you can use control shift f ten also key, but I'm using default here.

177
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.290
So now I will put names John.

178
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.100
So we'll come to chat room each and everything.

179
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.500
It will.

180
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.740
My localhost connection is accepted.

181
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.870
And now you can say who is in.

182
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.280
You can mention that name.

183
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.900
So you can say at this time, John, join the chatroom.

184
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.030
So this is how you can create this.

185
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:23.450
So if you want to run more clients or you want to check, basically, as I told you, I run this only

186
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.510
I run this only at one instance client.

187
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.120
What I'm going to do, I want to run more client.

188
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.190
So what I'm going to do?

189
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.730
Go to edit configuration after edit configuration.

190
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:42.770
You can see there is a one dialog box I think I'm unable to see here, but you can see a new box here

191
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.340
first.

192
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:49.430
In that new box, what you are going to do, you are going to create new configuration you need to install.

193
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:58.220
When I plug in to this ID, which is basically multi run plugin inside that multi multi plugin, you

194
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:03.680
need to mention the name of that plugin, choose configuration to run.

195
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.290
You can see there are two things here.

196
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.850
Run server and client.

197
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:08.660
Run client.

198
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.180
You can use that part.

199
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:17.630
So in that way, you can create your own things here.

200
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.650
Basically these are some similar things.

201
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:23.930
Four.

202
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.360
You can say adding the plug in each and everything.

203
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.290
So you need to mention that which you are adding here.

204
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.000
So I'm adding the client to it.

205
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.640
And so what I'm going to do, I'm adding another client.

206
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.440
So as you can see, there are two clients I'm running currently.

207
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.830
Another name is Sam.

208
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.280
So as you can see, Sam has joined the room.

209
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.130
Let me add one more client here.

210
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.130
These basic materials then?

211
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.110
Lion B.

212
00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.750
And it will run the plant.

213
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:00.800
Okay.

214
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.100
So this is my another client.

215
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.510
You can see there are three clients.

216
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:06.960
John.

217
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.590
Sam.

218
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.580
I don't want to dominate.

219
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:09.970
John.

220
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.510
Sam.

221
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.660
And third is.

222
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.350
ABC.

223
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:22.520
So in the server part you can say John is then STEM and then ABC has joined.

224
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.610
So I want to broadcast some message.

225
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.320
I want to check who is in.

226
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.380
So.

227
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.720
Why does the exception is writing and each and everything it's been it's basically not serialized.

228
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.980
You should put this only.

229
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.770
So now.

230
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.500
There isn't anything use of this or exception you can put in.

231
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.040
Okay.

232
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.600
Establish the rules of order from the host machine.

233
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.230
So now why?

234
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.970
Because.

235
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.860
The exception is only John has left the chapel.

236
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.890
So as I told you, you need to mention each and everything.

237
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.800
So let me stop this process first.

238
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.190
The John.

239
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.890
Let me run that John again.

240
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.570
Stop and return.

241
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.810
So.

242
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.600
Let me run.

243
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.890
Stop all the things.

244
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.770
Let me run server first.

245
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.780
Then let me run the client first, which is basically John.

246
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.970
Let me run.

247
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.080
Stop and read.

248
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.680
Written.

249
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.230
Then first.

250
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.470
Then let me run.

251
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.380
This.

252
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.270
Which is basically ABC.

253
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.040
So let me check first using.

254
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.050
Okay.

255
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:57.010
Then.

256
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.960
So now we are done with each and everything.

257
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:02.740
So.

258
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.480
What I'm going to do is I'm going to run the server first.

259
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.230
Then I'm going to mention the client here.

260
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.850
Then I'm going to run your client one year.

261
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.360
And I'm going to run Lion three year.

262
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.450
His name is John.

263
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.160
Second name is.

264
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.350
Then.

265
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.870
This is not a bad.

266
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.880
Code name is ABC.

267
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.840
So as you can see, Sam and each and every one is joining this room.

268
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.640
This is the drawing card.

269
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.030
So if I put who is in.

270
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.980
It's a blueprint, each and everything.

271
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:59.230
So similarly, you can create more threads here, each and every part.

272
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.300
So let me go with some more parts here also.

273
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.490
So we created this part.

274
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:09.750
In the next videos, I'm going to tell you how we can create Java string part each and everything.

275
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.360
So hope you understand this part.

276
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.270
If you want to check more parts here, you can go.

277
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.110
Let me.

278
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.130
Jake Foster.

279
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:21.640
Okay.

280
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.730
So let me run this again.

281
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.930
Server part.

282
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.660
So I will tell you all the functions here first.

283
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.410
No, because I haven't mentioned that part in earlier.

284
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.330
Then my client should be running.

285
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.080
Then my client.

286
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.280
One should be running.

287
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.800
Then my client three should be running.

288
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.490
So as you can see, I can create more clients here.

289
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.200
It's a beautiful thing for what we can say.

290
00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.640
Java and Multithreading.

291
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.860
ABC.

292
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.860
So you can say all the things that are created here.

293
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.720
If I want to broadcast message.

294
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.270
Hello.

295
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.210
I'm getting the exception of Iowa station because server is closed the connection for that purpose.

296
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.980
So similarly, you can do this stuff and you can proceed with this part.

297
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.510
So this is all about how we can create this part.

298
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:30.070
In the next video, I'm going to mention the server part, client part and chat message each and everything

299
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.490
here.

300
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.140
So this is it.

301
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.100
We can create all these jobs in a further part.

302
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:45.250
I'm going to tell you what this part also, plus some Java string and UI part of the client trips.

303
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.730
So I hope you understand this part.
