1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,070
In previous video, we learned how we can create method and how we can learn.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,300
In further, I'm going to explain how we can store this information into one file.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,920
So let us see.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,750
I'm going to specify public void again.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,600
Public void.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,860
Store file.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,730
Method.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,530
Store file method.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,480
This is just a method.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:31,210
Now I want to I am going to use your file return for that I already use or imported this library java.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,490
This is very important library for file method.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,920
So.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,010
Before file method, you should throw the user defined exception for that purpose.

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm going to use your try.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,540
Trick edge is very simple user defined exception methods.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,880
Or we can say it is not very user defined.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:58,660
We can say it is error handling method system dot dot println or the error handling.

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,780
So let us see inside this this how we can create file writer.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,090
In is equal to new file writer.

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,380
You have to specify the is the.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,520
And basically location of that file or you can say that info if you are not giving that part.

22
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,870
You can just put file name here, but it will create in the system default.

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:33,050
But in my case, I'm going to use your desktop location file, which I already created.

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,250
So just I'm putting the full part.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Always remember you should do the full part for.

26
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,860
In for texting while you're giving different file for that purpose.

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,390
If you are going to use the same file inside your project or you are going to create, you can just

28
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,120
put that name on file name.

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,700
After that.

30
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,970
I want to put that part in.

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,990
Right.

32
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:10,430
What I'm going to write is here is first name because there is no nothing mentioned that is first name

33
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,910
or something.

34
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,330
So.

35
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,710
Similarly, I'm putting your first name here.

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,890
Then not.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,210
I'm not going to write it again.

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,300
I'm going to append it.

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,890
So I'm going to append it.

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,700
Your only.

41
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,760
Last name.

42
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,120
Okay.

43
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,020
You can put your slash in.

44
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,630
Always remember slash in.

45
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,960
This dot alarm.

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,930
Again, not open.

47
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,360
Similarly, I'm going to put everything here now.

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,070
Email every.

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,560
Everything.

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,070
So similarly, this.

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,000
Like that, you can put everything.

52
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,670
Email.

53
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,160
Then in not open.

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,110
Password.

55
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,670
Ideally, you should not store any password, but I'm considering this as a database.

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,310
So I'm putting this as.

57
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,840
In a password also.

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,510
Then what happened?

59
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,500
Smashing.

60
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,980
Or capacity again.

61
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,860
Capacity.

62
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,690
Let's.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
This is not what his name is.

64
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,910
Male capacity.

65
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,130
Not.

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,560
Append.

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,560
Or alternate.

68
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,500
AlterNet made.

69
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,560
Let's.

70
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,160
Would this not alternate me?

71
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,400
Email.

72
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,980
What is the image?

73
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,300
That's it.

74
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,350
Now I'm going to close this.

75
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,110
Always remember, this is best practice.

76
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,960
To close everything.

77
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,990
And just system dot.

78
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,730
Outdoor rental in.

79
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,050
Data stored.

80
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,260
That's it.

81
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,380
Now.

82
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,480
This is what story we need to create for reading, but also similarly.

83
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,030
Reading.

84
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,330
While.

85
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,610
Method.

86
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,860
Public void.

87
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,700
It should not be public, but for.

88
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,580
System convenience.

89
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,930
I'm going to use this part really redefine.

90
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,800
Similarly you are going to use edge here for.

91
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,250
Exception handling exception E.

92
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,490
Sys node dot println e.

93
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,080
Instead this.

94
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,250
You're going to handle it.

95
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,220
Yet.

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,260
I'm going to use file reader.

97
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,660
Method Java you can use input stream.

98
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,680
These are very efficient thing your output stream input stream it will serialize it, serialize it.

99
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:33,720
These are very helpful but due to time constraint and also there is no need to put everything.

100
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,070
I'm just going to use this.

101
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,840
So file name as mentioned in the store file, I'm going to copy this part.

102
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,780
The Court also just based it.

103
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,920
And when the time comes.

104
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,480
And then just I'm creating polenta because it will loop through the characters.

105
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:59,680
And so it is very difficult to understand, but it is very helpful, vital for the small, small part

106
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,710
and project if name not.

107
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,290
There is some default till that.

108
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,550
What is that part?

109
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,440
Still.

110
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,140
Not equal to minus one, which is basically not null.

111
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,600
What it will do.

112
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,360
It will print system, dot, dot, print in the console.

113
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,500
What will you print?

114
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,240
It will print.

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:34,410
Correct stinks because it will access that in what we can say in the integer part.

116
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,800
But I want to print it as a character so it will ask for character.

117
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,080
Once this one is done.

118
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm going to close.

119
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,030
Your connection is close.

120
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,620
And this part is done.

121
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:57,250
If you want, you can put your one system dot dot println statement just this to give the gap.

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,990
And we are done with this, but we haven't created anything in that main part.

123
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,390
So as you know, for this, I want I will extend that part.

124
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:16,100
So as 50 exist but now if part is for the store data in.

125
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,330
But you.

126
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,400
No sixth option is for.

127
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,200
Display data from.

128
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,440
And now the seven parties for exit.

129
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,600
Similarly, we are going to change this in this part.

130
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,070
Fifth part is as it is, but.

131
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,510
I'm going to change this statement.

132
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,680
To what?

133
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,720
To store that data.

134
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,980
M one dot.

135
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,300
Store, lady.

136
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,080
Then four after break condition is six.

137
00:07:59,580 --> 00:07:59,940
Ian.

138
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,630
We're not.

139
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,190
Redefine.

140
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,630
Precondition again.

141
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,390
Then seven is no.

142
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,830
System Dot.

143
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,530
Old friend Ellen.

144
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,860
Thank you for using.

145
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,250
I would.

146
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,490
Application.

147
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,750
And then again.

148
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,770
But now we are going to change this condition also.

149
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,950
So now we are done with our project part.

150
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,350
Let's run this part and I will explain how you can create some Java file here with the Java Archive

151
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,770
file.

152
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,690
So let's run this part.

153
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,970
Arun.

154
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,270
So it will ask for first name.

155
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,470
James.

156
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,700
B So new employee his name is James.

157
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,610
B I'm setting it for sales department.

158
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,950
I will ask for the show info so it will show info.

159
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,190
Now you can understand each time this is different and it is not taking numbers.

160
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,390
Now you can see it is just putting some random variables and everything.

161
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,180
Spoonful.

162
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,660
Then I want to store it into the file store, into the data store.

163
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,730
As you can see, destroyed into the file.

164
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,320
If I'm putting display data, you can see now this is printing to this.

165
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,840
Now you will understand why this is printing to this.

166
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,050
So you need to change something here.

167
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,720
You will understand what we did.

168
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,770
Mistake here is as this is done.

169
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,330
But before that.

170
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,470
Or in the choice.

171
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,370
Wait a minute.

172
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,900
In the store file.

173
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm printing this statement.

174
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,870
This will create some error so you can remove this part.

175
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,880
And also just remove this slash and also it will create step by step.

176
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,590
So it is very difficult to understand.

177
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,950
So always never give the slash in this part.

178
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,530
Now I will run it again and I will show you.

179
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,370
So.

180
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,700
This is all about our application.

181
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:28,720
So.

182
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,560
I will put it in James V.

183
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,770
Sales department again.

184
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,520
It's stolen data file.

185
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,960
Display that data.

186
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,700
You can see our data is displaying.

187
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,590
Oh, now.

188
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,740
Let us see.

189
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,060
Wait a minute.

190
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,610
I made one error also print.

191
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,500
Just put print here.

192
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,480
And also you slash in here to our debt error.

193
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,090
Selection, selection, selection, selection and selection leather.

194
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,220
Let's run it again.

195
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,300
Now we debug with our problem.

196
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,480
As you can see, it's printing character by character because of the print statement.

197
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:16,600
No.

198
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,670
I'm going with print statement.

199
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,900
Jim's.

200
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,830
Me since department store into that data display data.

201
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,400
So as you can see, it is displaying the data capacity and everything.

202
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:39,220
So now we are done with our project, but let's see how we can create one single file or we can see

203
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,640
some single jar file Java archive file for executing this part.

204
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,910
We are already done with our project.

205
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,680
So as I told you, we are going to create one single executing file with our project.

206
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,420
So for this purpose, go to this file option project structure.

207
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,870
But.

208
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,090
In what you can see this first dialog box but go to artifacts here.

209
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:10,390
But this button jar file and we want to create with dependencies, modules, e-mail application.

210
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,240
So as you put something here, it will automatically detect this part.

211
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,810
Class.

212
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,960
We need to put in class.

213
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,410
Click.

214
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:20,920
Okay.

215
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,000
Once it is okay, click again.

216
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,440
Okay.

217
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,460
It should be system default.

218
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,960
Don't change anything here.

219
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,370
Then click apply and then enter.

220
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,940
Okay.

221
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,790
Now the artifact is loaded, but we want to build it.

222
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,730
So go to build here and create this build artifacts.

223
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,990
So it will do optional.

224
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,910
Build what?

225
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,690
Rebuild clean.

226
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,380
Added something.

227
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,520
So build.

228
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,480
So it will take time to build as you can see in the dialog box here bottom.

229
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,850
It is building this and it is doing so.

230
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,680
It will take time to build.

231
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,330
As for our project requirements, our project requirements are very less in this.

232
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:11,700
So now you can see in the output and artifacts, you can see this email just by email application file.

233
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,620
So if you want to run this part, you can you have to edit the configuration.

234
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,000
So go to this table edit configuration part here.

235
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,560
You will see this dialog box click add new button here.

236
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,210
Then there is a huge list for this.

237
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,890
So go to down here.

238
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,820
Or inside this, you can.

239
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,790
You have to identify this job application.

240
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,080
Job application here.

241
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,520
Click enter.

242
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,020
You can give the name.

243
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,710
I'm going.

244
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,290
The name has email app, local machine and you the job part here.

245
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:55,510
So in this job part is always in out artifacts and this you can see what we can apply.

246
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:01,060
Now you can run this email app, but and as you can see, this is printing this everything.

247
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,220
So our job file is running.

248
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,190
That class we are running now.

249
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,420
We are running with Java.

250
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,360
Let's see how we can run the command prompt itself.

251
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,380
So I'm going to pause this part and I will show how we can

252
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,580
do this in the command prompt.

253
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,390
So let's run our.

254
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,790
Java, Java, slash Java.

255
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,800
And that name of your job.

256
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,070
You.

257
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,040
So you can see this is running.

258
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:42,760
I'm again putting this James be then as developmental and info as you can see in printing similarly

259
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,300
like that you can create one application.

260
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:51,400
So this is very basic application we are going to use, but you can move further with that any part

261
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,660
like you can create Java if you for this and anything.

262
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,430
So let us see what we achieve in this.

263
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,500
So as you can see, we created one part if name.

264
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,910
So for the overview of our project, we created one random method.

265
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,640
We use that to create email application.

266
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,690
So we created different methods and we are using this.

267
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,050
So this is all about our project Java application.

268
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,650
Thank you.
