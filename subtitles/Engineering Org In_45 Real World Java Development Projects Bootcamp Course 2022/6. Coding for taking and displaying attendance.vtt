00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.670
So in this video, we will be talking about the next two classes, which will be take attendance and

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.100
list attendance for the employers.

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.830
So this first class here is a take attendance class.

4
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.130
So we have imported the necessary packages like Java SQL to connect with the database.

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.460
Java dot Java extract is a swing to create a better graphical user interface.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.330
Similarly for the Java WP and Java dot dot event to handle events over buttons or menu items.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.880
After that, we have defined the public class take attendance, which is extending the frame and implementing

8
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.810
action listener.

9
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.900
Inside which we have defined the seven labels and seven text fields, there will be two buttons and

10
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.960
three choices C to F and such.

11
00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.310
Then we have defined the non parameterized constructor for that take attendance class.

12
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.760
Inside the constructor we have set the layout of the frame as new grid layout for comma to 50.

13
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.600
Comma 50.

14
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.740
See to is equals to new choice we have initialized here now inside the tribe log.

15
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.780
What we are doing is we are creating a connect instance of connection class, which we have discussed

16
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.380
earlier, which will help us to connect with the database.

17
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.250
And inside the initializing the results.

18
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.600
At instance, we are executing the query with the help of see DOT as s select extract from employ.

19
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:46.160
So what it does, it will iterate over record of all the employers and while dot dot next will be iterating

20
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.060
over all the records one by one over the rows of those records.

21
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.220
So for every row what we are doing is we are adding the choice.

22
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.840
Of adding the IDs of those employers to the to our choice variable C to.

23
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.000
It can't block will handle any exception if of.

24
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:15.600
Then what we did is we have added a label to our DJ frame with the name as select employ number and

25
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.360
then we have added the choice to our DJ frame.

26
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.060
After that, we have defined the label.

27
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.950
Name that first half.

28
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.440
And then we have defined on initialize the choice which is equals to new choice.

29
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.650
For first half, we have added the choices in our effects variable like first is present, absent or

30
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.950
lib.

31
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.570
So either three conditions can be there for the attendance purpose.

32
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.500
Either the person is present in the first half or absent in the first half, or the employee is on leave

33
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.230
currently.

34
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.670
Adding that label to our frame and also its respect to.

35
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.200
Uh, choice field after that.

36
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.810
What we are doing is we have defined a two.

37
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.510
That is a label labeled as second half.

38
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.750
So this label will be used to store attendance of second half, so as is equals to new choice.

39
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.080
So this will create a new choice instance named as assets.

40
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.220
And inside the second of choice we have added, present, absent and live similarly, which as we have

41
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.480
added in the first half choice instance we have we are adding the three choices in our second half instance

42
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.050
as well.

43
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.520
After that, we have added our L2 and second half choice to our frame.

44
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.960
After that we have defined a button we when it goes to new button submit.

45
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.670
So this is the button which will when we will click on submit so that attendance will be uploaded to

46
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.950
our database.

47
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.940
Also, we want its background color as black and foreground color as white.

48
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.700
Then we have to find another button b two labeled as cancel.

49
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.790
Whose background color is black and foreground color is white.

50
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.030
We have added both of the buttons to our frame.

51
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.010
After that, we have added access to both of the buttons with the current instance.

52
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.080
Then we have set the background property of the complete window or frame as white.

53
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.030
Then visibility of the window as true and its size as 400.

54
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.600
Cross 450 and its location at 600.

55
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.530
Comma 200.

56
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:43.590
Now we have defined the action performed method over the argument past to it is action event e inside

57
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.970
this action performed the method.

58
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.750
What we are doing is we are creating a string f inside which we are restoring efforts to get selected

59
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.350
item.

60
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.200
So inside the string f we are restoring the selected item from the first half choice.

61
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.040
Now inside the string s, we are restoring the selected item from the second half choice.

62
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.580
Inside the string d d.

63
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.210
We are creating a new Java.

64
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.780
..8.2 string.

65
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:21.590
So this will take the current date on which the attendance for that particular employee have been recorded.

66
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.140
Then we will be showing a string ID as equals to see to get selected item.

67
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.070
So this fill is store the selected item from the string from the choice see to and store it into a string

68
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.640
ID.

69
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.590
Now there is a string query we have created inside which we have initialized the insert into attendance.

70
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.540
So this query will insert the data into our attendance table, which we have created in our database

71
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:57.540
and library video values as ID data F and as these will be the values inside our attendance table.

72
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.750
Inside the tribe log.

73
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.210
We have created our connection and stance by using our common class and with the help of the statement

74
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.310
instance and the class instance.

75
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.980
C 1.2. Execute Update Query.

76
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:18.670
We have passed the testing query so that the data will be inserted into our attendance table in our

77
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.420
database.

78
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:26.080
After that, we have shown or displayed a dialog box which shows that attendance confirmed.

79
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.220
Then we will set the visibility of the current window as false and inside the catch block.

80
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.570
We will be handling any exception if of course inside the static void main method, we are just creating

81
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.140
the take attendance instance of this class.

82
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.480
So this is all about the taking attendance of employees.

83
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.730
Let's have a look how the attendance.

84
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.310
We can check the attendance for any employee.

85
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.400
So that will be in list attendance to our Java file.

86
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.670
So here we are at list attendance on Java file.

87
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.710
So import Java SQL testing.

88
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:06.320
So we are first importing the Java SQL package which will help us to create a connection with our database

89
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:14.750
Java Export Swing, AWP and JWT event, which will be helping us to handle the events over the buttons.

90
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.470
After that, we are creating the class or initializing defining the class list attendance which is extending

91
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.840
frame and implementing action list.

92
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.520
Now after that there is a table J one and J button B one.

93
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.670
Then a string edge.

94
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.840
Inside the string edge, there is an array of a string of what we are doing inside this string edge

95
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.420
array.

96
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:45.190
We are restoring the values like employ ID, date time, first half and second half.

97
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.480
So this is the string edge array which will be used as a number of columns or the name of the columns.

98
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:58.340
Then we have defined a string D, which is of a two dimensional area of a string named as D, its size

99
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.810
will be 15 plus four.

100
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.060
Then we have defined the two integer variables as equals to zero and j is equal to zero.

101
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.660
After that we have defined the non parameter constructor of this class heading as will employ attendance.

102
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.850
Setting the size of that particular frame, frame as 800, comma, ten, 300.

103
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.950
After that, we have set the location.

104
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.740
As for 50, comma, 150.

105
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.470
For that particular window.

106
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:32.160
Now, inside the lock we have created a string Q on which we have installed select asterisk from attendance.

107
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:38.220
Now, with the help of the Cons, even as it goes to new con, what we are doing is we are creating

108
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.860
the instance of our con class which will help us to.

109
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.060
Interact with the database.

110
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.550
Now, inside the results set with the help of the instance of results that we are executing that query.

111
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.820
Seven point start, execute, query and pass that string.

112
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.680
Q So that the select testing from attendance query will be executed.

113
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.800
And now while I start next, will what this line will do.

114
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:10.160
This will iterate over the record of the attendance row by row so as to start next for first time it

115
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.780
will be showing the record of first edit first row.

116
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.350
In the second time it will show the record of the second row.

117
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:24.860
So we are storing that particular records in our two dimensional area with a comma j plus plus as I

118
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.830
will be used for the row and J will be used for column.

119
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:35.070
So we are incrementing our columns and storing the particular ID date time f off as those are first

120
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.660
time and second half details in our two dimensional area.

121
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:47.950
So after a successful inserting of the values in first row, we will increment the value of five for

122
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.030
the second row and take down the g value of G to zero again.

123
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.480
Then we have defined the game and it goes to a new table by passing that two dimensional array and the

124
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.890
number of columns or the string array edge.

125
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.930
After that, the cache block will handle any exception, if course.

126
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.540
So B1 is equals to new button print.

127
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.740
So this will button this button will be used for the printing purpose.

128
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.100
Then we have added that button be one comma sound.

129
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.430
So what we are doing is we are adding that button to our frame.

130
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:30.270
And then we have defined a scroll panel as one is equals to no scroll panel and passed the instance

131
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:37.920
of the table to that a scroll panel so that the table must be scrollable if there are multiple records

132
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.170
adding that scroll panel to our frame.

133
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.500
After that, we have added action lists not also to our.

134
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.100
Button.

135
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.920
After that, we have defined public void action performed method which is taking an action event a and

136
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.910
inside the try block.

137
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.190
What we are doing is we are calling German print.

138
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.450
So if we want to print that sentence we can click on the print button and it will take us to the print

139
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.160
page for that particular record.

140
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:09.900
Catch BLOCK will underline the exception if occurs now public static void main string appears inside

141
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.410
this method.

142
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:16.170
We have just created the instance of the listed condensed method and set the visibility as true.

143
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.670
So this is all about the two classes which we have discussed in this video.

144
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.500
So the first class was taken and which will help us to take the attendance of the employees.

145
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.950
And the second class was listed attendance which will help us to show or have a display or have a look

146
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.300
on the attendance of any particular employee.
