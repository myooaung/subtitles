1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,020
Okay.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:08,700
So in the last part we were talking about this children function, which was creating the child to the

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,250
north.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:16,890
We can see that the parent, they were adding notes to the tree like structure of this parent and this

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,410
if statement was checking that if files are not equal to not.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,380
So suppose if a folder is empty then how new note should be added.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,480
And otherwise, if it is not empty, then this statement will work.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,400
If already files are present inside that folder, then simply new folders will be mutated inside the

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,570
three note structure.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,480
Now are talking about this get image.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,190
So suppose if we want to open an image file.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:56,190
We already talked about opening files and inside that we were opening IMG extension or JPG extension.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,980
So how that get image function is working.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,440
We have used this get image in the open open file function here.

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:06,610
Here.

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,800
We have used this get EMG.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,480
You can see that.

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,130
I have highlighted this.

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,650
So this get IMG is the function which is working like this.

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,870
So we have a task to try and catch.

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,220
So what I am doing is doing this get I am just simply taking the part of that image.

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,030
Basically, this is returning the part of that image we want to open.

23
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,780
Suppose you want to open this paint dot jpg then that get img function.

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,540
We'll call that.

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,930
So a part of that image which we want to open on the display panel.

26
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:52,820
And otherwise, if there is no image inside that file that is a fake file created, then it will show

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,150
simply that error image not found where we have an event like get message event.

28
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:04,250
So yes, it will return null as nothing will be returned in that display panel.

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,880
So this is how this get image is working.

30
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:15,890
Okay, so suppose if the get image has some images, then how the width and height of that images will

31
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,130
be adjusted to the scale.

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,700
So this is the scale.

33
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,240
Suppose that is image existing then it should adjust itself to this frame.

34
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:32,470
This is the display panel shop frame side and the image should adjust itself to this frame only.

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,010
So this function is responsible for like returning the image according to the size of the frame.

36
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,680
Okay, so this show a message dialog.

37
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:52,670
So dialog box are very important part of this applications we had having dialog, we are having g option

38
00:02:52,670 --> 00:03:00,410
prints in almost all of the functionalities, whether we want to create a new folder or a new file or

39
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:09,080
we want to rename some folder and then this pop up menu is appearing, asking for some text or simply

40
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:16,880
if we want to like rename, then it will simply ask for a new name and it will also contain two button

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,140
so can cancel or also one a pop up menu.

42
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,280
We have seen when we are right clicking any of the files and folders which was containing options such

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,510
as Save, Rename and the important option inside that popup menu was open index.html.

44
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,920
So from that popup menu we were able to open any of the folders inside our desktop window or not in

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,060
the application window.

46
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:50,810
So with that option we can exit that application window which we are talking about and we will be navigated

47
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,490
to our desktop window.

48
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,550
Now basically the desktop files explorer.

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,540
So yes, talking about this search show message dialog.

50
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:09,440
So we are so here we are having mouse adapter function which is going to like listen to the actions

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,760
performed by the mouse, whether the mouse is pressed, the mouse is click and in that manner things

52
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,500
are going to be listened by the application according to the mouse.

53
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,270
So if the mouse is pressed, then a pop up should happen.

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:34,190
If the mouse is clicked on any of the option, then a like event is getting the source, whether or

55
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,960
wherever the mouse is getting click and it is going to click the count.

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
So how actually this click count is working.

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,660
So this Click Count is initially set to one and whenever this count is increasing, like suppose we

58
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,930
are clicking the mouse firstly head and then again inside itself subfolder then are the click is getting

59
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,750
count and what is happening with the help of the two or two things are getting updated with the clicks.

60
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,660
One is the pattern and second is the number of elements panel in the footer.

61
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,120
So two things are getting updated with the mouse motion is not a component.

62
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,510
We can see that that once the mouse is getting clicked, then the path and the element number of elements

63
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,770
should get updated.

64
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:31,100
So yes, this is how this mouse adapter function is working now coming to the pop up menu again.

65
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,450
So yes, I was talking about this pop up menu.

66
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,700
We are calling this pop up menu component of the string library.

67
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:49,370
This class is named pop up menu and this class is creating yes, this four options rename new folder,

68
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,800
new file and open index.html.

69
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,400
So we have encountered this pop up in the working of the application part.

70
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:05,060
Or once we tried to right click any of the folders, then a pop up menu was appearing asking for these

71
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,110
four options.

72
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,430
Rename new folder, new file and open index.html.

73
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,170
So we try.

74
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,130
Go open a folder in the backstop with the help of that pop up menu.

75
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:24,270
So yes, this is the pop up menu which we were like talking about, and this is basically the alignment

76
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,320
of the pop up menu.

77
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,910
So get text and get why is the distance from this pop distance of this pop up menu from the X and y

78
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,650
axis?

79
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,910
So yes, this is all about the layout part of the pop up menu.

80
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,280
Okay.

81
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,300
So yes, this is the private static final function basically.

82
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,600
And inside this function there are menu bar items.

83
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,740
So the pop up is appearing in the form of a menu that is a menu bar which is containing some of that

84
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,250
dishes.

85
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,600
We can say that here.

86
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,450
The dishes are the options inside the menu.

87
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:07,440
So the menu bar was a pairing containing four options, rename and folder file and open index.html.

88
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:13,230
And inside the gym this pop up menu function, we were adding mouse events.

89
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:20,760
So whenever the mouse will be clicked or basically a right click whenever made, then these four options

90
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,900
are going to be append related to any of that specific folder.

91
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,270
And what could happen?

92
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,090
What would happen when we click this rename new folder and new file option in the from the menu bar.

93
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,530
So if we click on the rename part, then simply the rename file button will get enabled which we have

94
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,750
already created above or similarly for the add folder and add file button.

95
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,600
Or that specifically created add file and folder button will be invoked.

96
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,820
Here we have created a dedicated function for adding files and folders.

97
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,840
There you can see that.

98
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,780
So yes, add file button and folder button.

99
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:08,710
So this specific action list will be invoked whenever we click any of the options from the menu bars.

100
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,620
So yes, this is how this pop up menu bar is working.

101
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,160
Yes.

102
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,840
So you can see that this is called again and again dot booklet.

103
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,060
So whenever our user clicks that the options from the menu bar, then that specific action list that

104
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,480
is going to take place.

105
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,530
Okay.

106
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:36,180
So yes, until now, this is all about the pop up menu bar now coming to the action perform.

107
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,840
So what is this action performed is related to?

108
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:48,200
So at this hour action performed is related to whenever we are trying to open any folder like suppose

109
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,310
if we are clicking right, clicking on any of the folder and hitting on this we name new file new.

110
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,930
But what if we are trying to open anything which is like not in any selected folder?

111
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:13,100
So suppose we want to like blindly click right click on any one of the folder, then this if our statement

112
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,510
is going to take place.

113
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:22,640
So suppose if we have like genuinely choosing a folder and trying to perform actions on it, then it

114
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,220
will open that file or folder in the display panel of course.

115
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:37,010
And if we are trying to choose any file or folder which is already selected, then our dialog message

116
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,370
box will appear showing that you choose Select File.

117
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:48,230
So basically you should choose us or select the file in order to perform any functionalities, whether

118
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,710
adding, renaming or opening index drop or anything, we have to firstly choose our file first, then

119
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:01,190
only we can or like perform any functionality on the folder or the file.

120
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,660
We can say that also.

121
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:09,200
Yes, at the last we have added all the four buttons to the name and folder, add file and open index.html

122
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,320
or to this pop up menu.

123
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,160
So yes, this was all about the pop up menu we chose appending on the right click now are coming to

124
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,410
the three cell renderer for a file.

125
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,740
So from the beginning we were talking about that.

126
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:32,360
All of the things like we are talking about here is that three we are talking about here, hierarchical

127
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,680
data structures.

128
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,820
There are roots that are nodes and like all three things we were talking about so long, so what?

129
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,490
Actually this tree is working.

130
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,520
How actually these trees are working basically.

131
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:54,010
So this file tree, cell render is a function which we are extending to default trees.

132
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,190
So this.

133
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:03,260
This is a Java string component default three cell renderer, which is going to render all of the files

134
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,930
and folders in the form of a tree which has made this application ready.

135
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:18,080
Or like we can say that simple and easy to be coded, and with the help of this component only we can

136
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,170
open this folder subfolders inside it and the files inside it very conveniently.

137
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:34,150
So this tree cell renderer is helping us to render all the files and folders inside the directory.

138
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,390
We can say that.

139
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,700
And that's in the form of objects.

140
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,300
So here we are talking everything in the form of objects.

141
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,830
We have created function and calling objects inside it.

142
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:52,040
So this tree cell renderer is converting all the childrens and the nodes in the form of objects and

143
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,420
that with also a feature that they are considered stored inside a tree.

144
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:05,630
So this tree is making all things in the form of a tree, but the object oriented program is applicable

145
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,110
to them.

146
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,220
Now, this is how this coding part is executed.

147
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,700
Now, let us try to run the application and see that if it is working correctly or not or there are

148
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,570
any bugs.

149
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,530
So perfect.

150
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,570
This application is open here.

151
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:27,770
You can see that there is a show panel, a display panel, all the four buttons, save the name, new

152
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,660
file, new folder, the count for the elements, the horizontal scroller.

153
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,330
So yes, the hierarchical structure we are just talking about.

154
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,380
Okay, so let us try to open something inside that drive.

155
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,290
So the path is updating.

156
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,870
Now, let's try to open this file browser.

157
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,560
Okay.

158
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,700
So we are inside this file browser and the path is updated.

159
00:12:52,730 --> 00:13:00,200
Now let us try to open this text file so you can see that the text editor has opened inside the display

160
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,590
panel.

161
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:06,500
Only we can add any text inside it and try to save it and it will be saved.

162
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,660
Now I'm hitting on this back button here.

163
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,280
You can see the back button.

164
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,170
This is the panel for the back button.

165
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,540
And we are back to the previous window.

166
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,780
Now, let us again try to open this file.

167
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,860
You can see that the modified text is appearing here.

168
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,800
Now, again, let us try to remove this unwanted text and again, saving it.

169
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,680
You can see that the file size is also appearing in the below panel.

170
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,160
The footer now on saving it.

171
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,120
We can also back.

172
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,540
Now let us try to create a new folder.

173
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,810
So let us name this folder as hello and click on.

174
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,470
Okay.

175
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,250
And the folder is created.

176
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,670
Hello.

177
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,570
Now let us try to create a new file inside this.

178
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,170
Hello.

179
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,950
So new file again, naming this file as hello.

180
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:56,270
And this will be created in the form of a text file and we can write and remove text from here also.

181
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,740
So I hope you can see that how conveniently that things are taking place, how conveniently we have

182
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:11,750
added everything inside our application, whether it be the buttons, the like, rendering of the tree

183
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,610
like structure, the notes and everything, the folder structure.

184
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,510
Once we open a file, the updated like this is also done with the help of the revalidate and repaint

185
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,110
function.

186
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,620
We have talked about it that once we update anything then that should be like a pat on the updated screen

187
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,280
also.

188
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,860
So initially there are only four folders.

189
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,630
Now we have added two of them.

190
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:42,680
Then this test and this hello is updating also in the modified frame structure.

191
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,440
So yes, this was all about this file browser interface application.

192
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,790
I hope that you all have gained much concepts to off Java through this application and I would encourage

193
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,560
you all to make this application on your own to learn more concepts.

194
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:08,960
And by practicing more and more on this project, it will definitely increase your skills in Java and

195
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,610
object oriented programming.

196
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,910
So I want to thank you all for joining this session.

197
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,110
And again, I would encourage you all to practice this on your own.

198
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,430
So thank you.
