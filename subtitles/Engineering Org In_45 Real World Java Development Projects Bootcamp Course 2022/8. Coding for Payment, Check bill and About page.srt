1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,830
So in this video, we will be talking about the last three remaining classes of this project, that

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,150
is cab booking system.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:13,450
So the first class here is the payment class, which will be used to perform the payment or for that

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,730
booking which the user have performed, booked or done.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,200
Then it is defined, the payment class is defined inside the cab booking system.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,990
We have imported the necessary packages like a duplicate color, a dot container, font, image, accent,

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,490
event, excellence, start and swing.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:39,090
Inside the payment class, which is extending the frame and we have defined the parameterized or non

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,400
parameterized constructor for the payment class.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,020
Set the layout as null.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,690
After that, we have defined the size for that payment class and its location.

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,120
Its location will be 600, comma, 2 to 0 and its size will be 800, cross 600.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,660
After that, we have defined a label like Pay the payment and setting its font family size.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Setting its font, family size, font type as.

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:15,380
Fond type as railway fond type font, family as railway font type as bold and font size as 40.

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,130
After that, what we are doing is we have set the label for the.

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,740
Uh.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,750
Set the label bound for that label 50, comma 20 and its size as 350, comma 45.

19
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,940
Adding that label to our frame.

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,990
After that, we have defined the image icon in image icon and scaled its instance and after that added

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,890
that image to our.

22
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,800
Level four.

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:50,470
And after that what we are doing is adding the bond for that label so that we can locate that level

24
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,420
and setting its size.

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,180
After that, there is a button pay which will handle an event for the pay button, and inside the play

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,520
button we will click the button.

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,860
We will simply show that our dialog box that the page successfully.

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,880
Now pay don't set bond will set the location for that payment and size of that pay button.

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,200
Inside the g button, new G button back, we are adding an action element.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,920
We will set the current visibility of the window as false and after that we are setting the bound for

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,880
that back button as 510 comma 2000 size will be eight plus 40, adding that back button to our frame.

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,190
After that we have defined the background color for that button current window as white and set the

33
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,150
visibility as true.

34
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,710
So inside the public static void main, we are defined new payments and the visibility as true.

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,430
Now for the check bill.

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,860
So this is the check bill class.

37
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,810
What we are doing in the check bill class that we are defined inside the package care booking system

38
00:02:50,810 --> 00:03:01,340
and boards our school district for the interaction with our database and AWP event classes for our particular

39
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,030
handling events over the buttons and graphical user interface.

40
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,670
Then what we are doing is public class segment, which is extending the frame and public static void

41
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,710
main inside the public static void main.

42
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,940
We have defined the instance of the check bill class with the null values and set the visibility as

43
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,420
true.

44
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:26,470
We have created a parameterized constructor for that check string username and located the bound for

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,900
that frame as 550 comma to 20 and its size as 900 cross 600.

46
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,570
After that, we will set the visibility of the.

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,290
Were frame as true.

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,650
Then we are setting the price one, price two and price three as zero.

49
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,830
So the price one will be showing the price for that intensity.

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,990
Back caps booked price two will show the price for the intensity type of bugs and price three will show

51
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,540
the price for the transportation and truck user have booked for transporting the goods.

52
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,360
Now inside the trip log, what we are doing is we are creating a connection variable of our class and

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,560
executing a query from select district from interactive where username will be username.

54
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,600
While for that particular user name record price one is goes to we will store the price from that enter

55
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:21,980
enter ccap table now address is goes to see dot x execute query select extract from Interac app.

56
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,070
So for that particular Interac app table, we will be storing the required for that particular username

57
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,010
and for price two inside the price to a string, we will be storing the price for the Interac.

58
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,530
Now inside the string name, we will be storing the name of that particular customer from with the help

59
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,460
of its user name.

60
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,250
So for that we will be storing name is also asked string name and we will store the name in our name

61
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,790
a string.

62
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,280
After that we will be executing select action from in transport where name will be matched.

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,360
So where the user name will match in in transport table, we will store the price of that transport

64
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,250
in our price.

65
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,210
Train a string.

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,880
After that there is a string array of package one inside which what we are doing is package one point

67
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,440
PMG intercity cable and price one.

68
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,460
So we have defined a string array type of package one inside which we have defined for the image of

69
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,320
that package name as intercity cable and that particular price.

70
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,320
Similarly for the intercity, we are doing the same thing.

71
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:39,200
I defined package two for the intercity cable image for that particular and the price of that particular

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,890
price too.

73
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,130
Similarly for the package three, we have defined the package three jpg that will be image name and

74
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,980
transportable and its respective price.

75
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,500
Now there is where we have defined the tab.

76
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,580
The pain and G8 panel defined a panel which will be create package and package one.

77
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,610
We have defined the create package method here.

78
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,390
We will be discussing about it just after discussing this.

79
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,010
So tabbed pane.

80
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,310
Inter-City cab complement.

81
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,860
Similarly, there is a pay to create package.

82
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,260
Pass that package to intercity intercity and LP to and similarly for the Japan LP three.

83
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,610
Transport LP three.

84
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,480
I did that tapped with the border layout as central to our frame.

85
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,220
Now we have defined here a type of panel type of method create package inside which we have passed the

86
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,280
is string named as pack.

87
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,450
So we have defined a panel piva and let us lay out that null and background color as white.

88
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,340
So inside the image we have, first initialize the image by adding the pack zero.

89
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,700
So what we have is stored in our every package.

90
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,020
The first element is the name of the image.

91
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,240
So that's why we are adding the path and adding that pack zero so that this will load the image.

92
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:02,350
Adding that image to our label, setting its location and size, and adding that to our panel.

93
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,040
After that, what we are doing is we are for the particular label name.

94
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,470
We are showing that text like intensity care or intensity care setting is font size and location and

95
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,580
adding that to our panel.

96
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:19,210
Similarly, for that transfer cap setting its font size, foreground color, label bound, setting its

97
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,690
bounds and ending that word panel, then we are showing the total bill.

98
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,640
And after that total bill, we will show the price which is stored at the total location.

99
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,640
So that index too, and setting its font type family, adding the foreground color, its location size

100
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,070
and adding that to our panel.

101
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,430
After that, there is a label to be as per that.

102
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,590
That's just for the formalities.

103
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,330
I have added that text to make transporters reliable, running water everywhere and for everyone.

104
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,340
So this is for the just reference purpose, setting the font family type for it and adding that bound

105
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,090
and adding that to our panel and returning the that label.

106
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,020
Sorry genotype so returning that panel so this will return those panels and added with the tab the pane

107
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,550
with the border layout center.

108
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,620
So this is all about the check class.

109
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,550
Let me tell you about the last class, which is about our Java file.

110
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,420
So this will tell us about the project when we will click on that menu item.

111
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,900
If you remember, we have discussed in our when we were discussing our home Java file, so it is inside

112
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,940
the define inside the cab booking system.

113
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,680
We have imported the necessary packages.

114
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,270
After that we have defined our about class which is extending frame and implementing Excel.

115
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:36,940
Now there is a one button, one label, three font and one text area and one string.

116
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,390
Inside the non parameterized constructor of this class we have set the layout as null.

117
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,500
There is a be one button setting labeled as exit add one button.

118
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,720
To our frame, locating our B-1 battalion, setting its size, adding action listener to that be one

119
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,330
button, then font as it goes to new font railway font dot bold.

120
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,040
So this is the type of font which will appear.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,020
Inside the string as we have defined these the.

122
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,810
Information about the project.

123
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,590
A brief introduction about that project and.

124
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,730
After that we have defined define the text area inside which we have passed that string.

125
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,510
It's string size, text size for the text area and a scroll bar vertical.

126
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,220
So the text area will be a scrollable vertical, also its editable property as false.

127
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,810
And then we have set the location and size for that particular text area.

128
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,570
After that, we have added the text area to our frame.

129
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,960
Then there is a defined the font font, bold 16 set font for that particular text area.

130
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,050
Then inside the container content pane, we have added defined a new text area and for the label about

131
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,600
project, this will be shown as about project added that label to our frame and set it set its bound

132
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,700
location, size and foreground color as read.

133
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,740
Then there is a font to really be font bold and 20.

134
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,550
Set the font for that label about project.

135
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,780
Then setting the location for the frame and after setting the layout as null and visibility as true.

136
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:17,810
Now inside the action perform method, we will be disposing the current instance and a static void when

137
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,520
we will be calling new about and set the visibility as true.

138
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,210
So this is all about from these last three classes.

139
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,190
In next video we will be having a look on our the library for this project.

140
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,250
So that's all from this video.
