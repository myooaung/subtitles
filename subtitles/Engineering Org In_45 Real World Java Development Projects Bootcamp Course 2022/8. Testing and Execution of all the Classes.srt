1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,340
Now let us start adding some more specifications to this code.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,260
So.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,520
Let us try to find.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,890
What happens after Marla receives her salary.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,850
Marla receives salary?

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,960
Yes.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:34,100
So the function is called and invoking the method get salary?

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,860
Yes.

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,180
So let's try to run this.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,150
And see what output we are going to receive.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,760
So it is showing an error.

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,850
That teacher name is me writing, not Marla.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,150
Marla is the student one of the students.

15
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,360
So.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,960
Yes.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,980
Rena is the teacher here.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,730
So now I'm going to run this again.

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,800
So yes, there is no change as we haven't seen this out anything.

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,770
So let us try to suss out.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,220
Again after paying it to Marla.

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,130
Sorry.

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,700
It's me.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,330
90.

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,540
Confusing with the names.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,000
So, yes.

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:37,850
Let us do the same for who we know is the right.

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,650
So replacing this head.

29
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,170
Yes.

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,970
So now, again, if we try to run this code.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,390
The money earned will be updated.

32
00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:00,550
So yes, school has spent a salary of RS 9000 and left with 90,000.

33
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,850
Now let us do a different thing.

34
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,340
Let us try to.

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,890
This out.

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,830
A student's face like.

37
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,550
Yes.

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,690
So here we are trying to say.

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,780
So, Rana, what is rather rather is a student here.

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,560
So let us see what its output is.

41
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,040
So you can see that there is a garbage value after student.

42
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,740
Suppose if we try to print what is it that has fees?

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:57,040
So we can write it as the fees paid by.

44
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,600
Closing it.

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,230
And then.

46
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,580
Bases.

47
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,360
Yes.

48
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,360
So if we try to run this.

49
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,530
So actually, you know what?

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,240
Let us remain this as.

51
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,180
Grab only and try to explore something more.

52
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,190
Currently it is giving a garbage value as this four.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,200
So let's get back to the student or zero part and.

54
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:57,290
Try to create a override to string function so we can write it as over.

55
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,170
Write.

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,940
Public string.

57
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,210
And the toasting method.

58
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,250
I will show you what this toasting method does.

59
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,010
Once after it is executed.

60
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,400
You will relate it with the garbage that you are receiving after calling the student.

61
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,180
So what is return by this function?

62
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,800
Student's name student.

63
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,290
Name.

64
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,160
Suppose student's name is Rana?

65
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,710
We call it their student name.

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,480
And.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,140
A colon.

68
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,080
The name variable.

69
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,830
Yes.

70
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,300
And the total fees paid.

71
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,740
Total fees paid.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,960
Still no word on the total fees paid over all but total fees paid till now.

73
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,000
In rupees.

74
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,140
So suppose I write.

75
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,430
Yes.

76
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,290
And the face brain function.

77
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,830
Yes.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,920
So calling it and closing it.

79
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,960
So, yes.

80
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:10,470
We are here with this two string function override two string function and let us call this again in

81
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:18,480
May not so sister dot println rather let us try to run it again.

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,040
So, yes.

83
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,290
Buffer students name rather.

84
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,150
Total fees payday loans â‚¹50,000.

85
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:39,800
So yes, initially it was returning guard value but with the use of two string function.

86
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,300
Yes.

87
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,620
So with this use of this tool string function, the garbage value is vanished.

88
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,000
So, yes, this is the use of this two string function.

89
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,590
We learn to.

90
00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:03,300
More function by far till now says you can try print other student also.

91
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,770
Yes.

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,240
Let us call it for one of the student.

93
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,110
Yes.

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,010
Juba.

95
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,030
So that will be received as the total fees paid by Jodi Arias.

96
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:36,240
So Jodi has total fees paid till now is zero, as in now only two students have paid the fees, Tamanna

97
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,260
and Rana.

98
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,590
So it is a perfect output.

99
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,450
The total fees paid is zero rather.

100
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,490
Total fees paid is 50,000 now.

101
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,600
Okay.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,620
So we have learned so many things by far in this project.

103
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:08,570
One more thing I would like to add is that this was the basic concept we were learning to this project.

104
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,950
One more thing that we can do with this is make a desktop window, interface it.

105
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,250
The output will open in a separate window like.

106
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,480
Not in the terminal.

107
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,670
There will be a separate window.

108
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
So if you want to explore more, you can do that.

109
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,090
It is a very simple task.

110
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:40,630
The main focus of this project was to teach you the basic concept of Java ops and classes and methods

111
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,440
in Java.

112
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,540
So let us quickly summarize what we have learned through this project by far.

113
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,800
Okay.

114
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,820
So before summarizing, we would also like to add the override to script.

115
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,160
For the teachers as well.

116
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,780
So, yes.

117
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,100
Adding the override.

118
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,770
Let me copy it from the student part.

119
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:18,940
Yes.

120
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,750
So yes, this is our right to strength function.

121
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,010
We have created it for the students.

122
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,910
Now we are creating it for the teachers also.

123
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,100
And in the teachers we have salary.

124
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,360
Get 77.

125
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,790
So it is like the name of the teacher.

126
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,750
The name of the pitcher.

127
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,340
Total salary earned so far.

128
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:09,430
So both sanity on and.

129
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,080
And then sadly on Soyuz.

130
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,290
Now let us try to test this.

131
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,140
Since out.

132
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,750
Now among the teachers is Samantha.

133
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,000
Mother.

134
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,800
Let us try to run this.

135
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,530
It has some errors.

136
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,030
Let me try to fix it.

137
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,030
So diabetes in that patient.

138
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,780
Oh, yes.

139
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,100
We missed the base.

140
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,460
We are following the principle of learning by doing.

141
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,620
I am learning.

142
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,640
Meanwhile, teaching you to make this project.

143
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:13,910
So if we miss something, we should learn this by solving the errors.

144
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,090
Solving the bugs is the best way to learn any language or make any project.

145
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:27,160
So yes, after fixing this error, we will go back and try to run this again.

146
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:39,790
So I guess my last total salary until now is as we haven't paid anything to Marla.

147
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,430
If we try to run it for another day, like.

148
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,100
Suppose it's.

149
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,240
Yes.

150
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,030
So if you try to run it for Russell, they.

151
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,950
Yes.

152
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,090
But also the total salary until now is 6000.

153
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,830
This is done with the help of the override tool string function.

154
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:16,480
This helps us to return the salaries until now and rest of the things.

155
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,950
So yes.

156
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,340
Now summarizing this project what we have learned so far.

157
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,410
We learn to create a school payment management system.

158
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,940
Like we manage the salary credited to the teachers.

159
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,820
The fees submitted by the students.

160
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,260
We have created four classes main class, school class, student class and teacher class.

161
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,570
For the school class.

162
00:12:50,460 --> 00:13:01,510
We calculated the total money, spent the total money by creating a separate method in the student class.

163
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:09,960
We have created the object, set aside name grade fees, paid fees total and similarly for the teachers.

164
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:20,760
So overall, we have learned the basic of Java and its oops concept head oops denotes object oriented

165
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,420
programming.

166
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:31,590
So after completing this project successfully, I hope you all will grasp will gain a good grasp at

167
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,740
this Java Basic Oops concept.

168
