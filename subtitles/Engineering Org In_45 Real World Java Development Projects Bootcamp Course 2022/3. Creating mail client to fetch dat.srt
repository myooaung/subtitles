1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:12,000
In previous thing I already told you, we created one email application and we are processing closely

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,520
with that part.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,740
So what we have done yet is we created one index or GSP.

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,550
If you want to check whether how it's looking or anything, what you can do, you can just go here.

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,420
You can check here the options and.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,720
You can check for that purpose.

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,460
We're web servers or.

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:48,980
Is config if their servers are not configured, you have to check for the web server configuration for

9
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,820
that purpose.

10
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,360
So currently no service is running for me.

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,680
So if you want to check, you can go to the settings and you have.

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,370
I'll check for the server, but this is for JSP page.

13
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,630
So go.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,800
So was.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,020
So you can check for that here also so you can check for all these.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,960
So this is our JSP.

17
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:25,750
But.

18
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,060
So this file which is formatted to send.

19
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,460
One email application with some table size and I'm adding some here.

20
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,660
So remember this op ego is just from this plant.

21
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,650
So this is my class where all the solids are going to work.

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,170
So this is my class I already prefer or I already told you about this.

23
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,460
So in this class, what I'm going to do, I'm going to create one method to handle request and response

24
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,910
everything.

25
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:06,980
So what I'm going to do is notice once this is constructor is closed, I'm going to create one method

26
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,300
to handle request.

27
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,290
And they request.

28
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,790
And just spots.

29
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,580
So what is the handling request or response inside any class of HTTP servlet?

30
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,890
I need to get to methods.

31
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,860
If you do post and you get which are very popular.

32
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,320
But in such case there is no required like do post method.

33
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,900
Because I'm not forwarding anything or I'm not doing any complex application I'm proceeding with only

34
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,490
do it.

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,240
So what I can do protect it.

36
00:02:50,990 --> 00:03:00,890
You can use us public also, but remember I am giving particular way to get this is the method basically

37
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:08,540
to get inside this to get what I'm going to do is it's ETB.

38
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,980
You insist, so I can choose for my response and everything.

39
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,210
So response and depend.

40
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,550
Yeah.

41
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,820
Then what I want to mention is here.

42
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,650
So let me do one thing here is GDP.

43
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,030
So it's not a response or GDP, solid response.

44
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,060
I forgot to add, Stevie.

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,960
It's a solid response.

46
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,250
So so response.

47
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,680
This was an introductory solid request also.

48
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,460
So you can take four years to be solid.

49
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,540
It was.

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,250
Only I can lose this horse because it's no longer required.

52
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,750
Giovanni Lapin.

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,860
And we are done.

54
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,670
Yes.

55
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,220
But.

56
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh.

57
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,260
Now I need to handle it.

58
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Request dispatcher And also so let me do one thing.

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,420
Let me minimize this so I can display this all.

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,820
So if you know there is one request.

61
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,270
DISPATCHER So you can refer any name here.

62
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,510
As I told you, I'm going with already.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,870
Which is really common in the case dispatcher.

64
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,010
So it's a request.

65
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,190
Don't.

66
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,190
Get request.

67
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,730
DISPATCHER So it's basically going to fetch the string part.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,700
So which string part is going to lose index?

69
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,340
So in this dot GSP.

70
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,970
Oh, now we are done with this.

71
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:16,580
So what is going to do it is going to fetch all the data as a string format from next door GST.

72
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,640
So this is basically you can say the location of my index dot is PM providing.

73
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:32,870
So remember always handle any exceptions through work exceptions, you might find your first servlet

74
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,530
exception.

75
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,210
So that exception Java solid exception.

76
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,870
Plus if I'm not providing input and output I.

77
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,560
Oh, exception.

78
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,560
So that's it, I'm going to tell you.

79
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,160
So now why am I here?

80
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,070
Sometimes in you may not get any exception here or you may not get any error.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,620
But by the user, if I'm not providing any input output, then this will not proceed.

82
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,130
So for that purpose, I'm putting this exception.

83
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm handling the exception to print that part.

84
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,140
Then our forward.

85
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,130
Response.

86
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,530
Request response in

87
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,220
response.

88
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,240
I'm going to handle this request in response.

89
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,600
So this is just a method to do anything.

90
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,250
So.

91
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,750
Right.

92
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,650
Okay.

93
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,030
First I will get request and then I will get response.

94
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,950
So I made an error.

95
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:50,270
We just don't know this is done because remember in the foreword, first is request, then response.

96
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,030
There is no first response from the server.

97
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,440
First is request always.

98
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,270
So you put here first.

99
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,700
Is always.

100
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,610
Nyquist any solid part.

101
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,690
So the solid but remember this is just getting part out we can see fitting data.

102
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,430
If I want to put any message, I also need to do post method.

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,260
Remember while posting a message.

104
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,310
I need one.

105
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,790
What's the matter here?

106
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,020
So.

107
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,550
I will put your get method.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,980
So let me put one matter to bring.

109
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,310
So message to.

110
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,410
Page.

111
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,650
So this is.

112
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,750
Post mortem.

113
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,370
Similar thing, protected void.

114
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,240
The Post.

115
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,050
If you know HGTV, Solarte is also.

116
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,020
Request.

117
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,720
So let me do one thing here.

118
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,560
Let me copy this part, because it's as it is.

119
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,210
No need to change anything.

120
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,090
The two post and the gate method remain the same and it throws this again.

121
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,250
I have exception and everything.

122
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,700
So why it's showing I exception.

123
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,210
I will tell you while developing any application you may find that part.

124
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,930
So what is going to ask her?

125
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,850
It will ask or what is going to fetch?

126
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,810
It is going to fetch.

127
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,970
It is going to fetch some data.

128
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,110
So which data stream email first.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:59,070
So if you know request dot get get parameter if you know the thing this get parameter as a string it's

130
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,850
going to fetch.

131
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,710
Stringer's image is going to fetch.

132
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,940
So let me copy these things again and let me tell you what I'm going to do.

133
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:20,370
So this for this, then this is just to send an email which receiver's email then subject for this purpose

134
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,550
I'm going to put here, subject.

135
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:28,710
Subject is basically anything but your title of your email and body, so you can put anything here.

136
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm putting as the message here message and this change also message.

137
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,120
So which are these strings, emails, objects?

138
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,390
And if you don't know, let me show you while putting this I gives the name here.

139
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,980
This is email, fish, email, subject and message.

140
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:56,700
So I created a connection here and I am now fetching this data as my everything.

141
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,460
So let me do one thing.

142
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,590
I can create an operation in Heroes.

143
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,470
So let me tell you why I'm putting operation.

144
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:15,040
Because by entering and accepting that in email application, once you put that part, request out,

145
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,590
get parameter.

146
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,910
And it's operation.

147
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,090
So I'm mentioning operation here.

148
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,970
Oh, let me show you.

149
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,620
Operation this operation.

150
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,530
So I need to create this op and everything.

151
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,310
So now.

152
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,920
So these are done.

153
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,990
But email.

154
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:54,460
We go, which is basically same thing here, but equals which is basically going to equal signal case.

155
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,000
It is going to ignore the cases or be.

156
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:05,550
She basically this OPI in the case is higher ground with that much on that part.

157
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,160
Now I'm going to set some messages in here, then I'm putting some things here.

158
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,830
So let me just copy these things and I will tell you what is the significance of this and what I'm going

159
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,850
to do here.

160
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,750
Get me a copy of this piece just so you.

161
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,150
I haven't created this part.

162
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,600
So what is going to do it, will?

163
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,050
I'm going to create an email message class here, which is going to handle set two sets, object, set,

164
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,270
message, set, message type part, which is basically HTML page is HTML message.

165
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,370
I'm going to mention here.

166
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:57,130
So all the things is consist in this email message part with email utility and it's going to send that

167
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,760
message.

168
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,620
So it's related to all these part, but I haven't mentioned this part.

169
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,270
So let me do one thing.

170
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,900
Let me handle this first, which is basically request.

171
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,470
Set.

172
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,950
Attribute.

173
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,370
Request.

174
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:11,650
Dot.

175
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,920
Set attribute.

176
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,060
First, the string.

177
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,130
String is message.

178
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,770
And what I'm going to mention is your mail.

179
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,230
Has been sent.

180
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,030
Successfully.

181
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:40,720
So once this is sent, what it will be do it will print this in that HTML part or we can say JSP part.

182
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,020
So I'm going to do this part later, but I just copied this and I already created this part.

183
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,330
I will tell you, what is the significance of this letter?

184
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,630
It is the main function to send any email here.

185
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,340
So this is done in e loop.

186
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:08,020
Now let me handle request dispatcher because dispatcher or d only is equal to request dot get request.

187
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,090
DISPATCHER get request.

188
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:16,690
DISPATCHER which is basically string indexed dot JSP is just that location which is single location

189
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,800
I would prefer and r d not.

190
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,710
Forward.

191
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,830
Request slash.

192
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,130
Response.

193
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,600
So now we are done with this male client.

194
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,590
So male client handling is very simple.

195
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,830
It will handle some it will ask for and fetch the data handling that JSP part.

196
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,620
It will do.

197
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,300
It will handle that part.

198
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,540
This email message is going to work with male client.

199
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,600
So considering if I told you earlier how my SMTP is going to work, I will tell you later.

200
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:02,280
But what this class is just doing it just like act as a fetching the data from that justified because

201
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,550
we are putting in JSP but we as a user we know that that we are putting in that mail client but we don't

202
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,470
know how the backend works actually.

203
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,910
So that's the backend part.

204
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,670
First, this mail client going to fetch data in further tutorials, I'm going to tell you how I am going

205
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,090
to create.

206
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,740
I am explaining the SMTP port also how it's going to work each and everything.

207
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,830
Plus I'm using here at Gmail as my SMTP.

208
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:32,040
I'm again telling you, if you are familiar with other SMTP services, there are a lot of SMTP services

209
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,060
available on the internet.

210
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,770
You can check through free SMTP services also works, so you can use that part also.

211
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,380
But I'm going with Jim.

212
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,640
Hope you understand this.

213
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,360
Thank you.
