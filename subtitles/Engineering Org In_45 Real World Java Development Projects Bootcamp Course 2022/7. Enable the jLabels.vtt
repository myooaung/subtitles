1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:09.360
Now we need boolean variables for giving the won and the lost value.

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.270
So here we take bullion emitters from equal and by default.

3
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.310
That is true.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:32.820
What we will do, we will go for that logic and in g panel to here we will set that on variable and

5
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.450
import.

6
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.230
Okay.

7
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.410
So here we will check one condition

8
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.850
after this.

9
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.540
If you choose order

10
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.160
to the counter, that one is equals to.

11
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.180
Cracks in the crack image has completed.

12
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.830
It means we have lost.

13
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.070
So here we will set one equal to false.

14
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.970
You're done.

15
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.290
And what we do on Stockholm.

16
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.630
Phones.

17
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.110
Now we have to change the food stamp.

18
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.440
So here we will check another condition.

19
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:51.140
If counter is equal to label, start length minus one and

20
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.970
one is equal to true.

21
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.830
So we will display image.

22
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.300
The food stops and here it goes with the chili.

23
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.460
Clear.

24
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.120
Finish this one here.

25
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.690
Done.

26
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.730
No, we have to do this same thing and this with this component.

27
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.480
So we will right here

28
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.430
display.

29
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.660
No.

30
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.820
Okay.

31
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.740
So what we will do here?

32
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:50.750
We take our condition and write in religious order with Gondor and one.

33
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.400
Dot equals.

34
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.260
Two.

35
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.510
It comes through cracks here.

36
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.300
Same with the previous one.

37
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.450
The one equal to false.

38
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.640
Now we have to.

39
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.110
Okay.

40
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.500
So here this part is being done with noon.

41
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.660
Okay.

42
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.800
Yeah.

43
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.200
So we have to change the.

44
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.270
Okay.

45
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.410
So here the same condition though.

46
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:40.750
If the counter is equal to labeled store length minus one and one more condition and is equal to true

47
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.760
then.

48
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.880
Center display image.

49
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.040
We know food stamps come here to finish.

50
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.670
Let's finish.

51
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.720
So it's done.

52
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.730
Now we will run our class.

53
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.500
And check it off.

54
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.080
It is running properly.

55
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.440
The too.

56
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.320
Okay, so what should we do?

57
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.260
You.

58
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.570
We have.

59
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.680
So.

60
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.690
Okay, in next six.

61
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.230
We will do one more thing.

62
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.380
What we will do.

63
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.330
I think the images are so important.

64
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.330
There is a call to change the images.

65
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.960
Order.

66
00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.680
Here.

67
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.680
Here also not the labels.

68
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.180
Should we go with the images or see this and run the file again?

69
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.890
No.

70
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.540
Check that.

71
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.550
Okay.

72
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.320
So the error is gone and simply what we will do.

73
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.240
We have done the contactless part and this phone is so okay.

74
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.670
So we have said here, we have to change this 1 to 0.

75
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.730
Yeah.

76
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.040
To zero.

77
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.450
Simply run our class again.

78
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.790
We are getting.

79
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.750
This conditioning check I'm giving him launched.

80
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.080
This one.

81
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.380
Okay.

82
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.910
So what we will do?

83
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.130
This thing is doing good.

84
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.880
Okay, so this thing is very tight.

85
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.710
Now we have to go here.

86
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.980
What can we do?

87
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.860
We?

88
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.680
We have to disable all levels first.

89
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.320
So here we will do.

90
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.760
We will take up for each for each loop here.

91
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.930
And what?

92
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.010
We will take a chili bowl.

93
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.200
Yeah.

94
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.070
One.

95
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.810
De re you re right.

96
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.730
LP and s cologne.

97
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:49.230
Simply write labels held under this LP set to the zeroth portion.

98
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.840
I'm here, Dodd said.

99
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.550
We need.

100
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.100
And here.

101
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.330
Okay.

102
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.970
So set it to the false.

103
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.990
So it's tone.

104
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.490
Well, tomorrow it has been.

105
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.490
Cannot wait.

106
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.590
We need authority.

107
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.520
We need those people.

108
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:30.930
Simply switching to this.

109
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.540
Don't know what I'll be asked for.

110
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.890
One should not sit and nibble.

111
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.970
The Sun Center to the phones, of course.

112
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.300
And it's done.

113
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.450
No, we will run our program and.

114
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.590
No.

115
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.100
Okay.

116
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.900
So something is wrong.

117
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:24.490
What can we do to just say, you should know we have to create a function.

118
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.460
Keen.

119
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.330
Cleared of function.

120
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.250
Unemployed labels.

121
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.380
The labels.

122
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.290
What do you mean?

123
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.950
Right.

124
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.510
Public void.

125
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.060
Unemployed neighbors.

126
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.890
And under this, we will write.

127
00:09:59.490 --> 00:09:59.660
Okay.

128
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.490
So we need a parameter of next integer.

129
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:16.190
And here we will write, we will check first to condition index is less than or equal to the stored

130
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.000
length.

131
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.430
Here.

132
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.220
So what we will do?

133
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.380
We will set the chili bowl.

134
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:34.760
Julie, Ari and Libby sequels to labels.

135
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.370
And labels.

136
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.290
We need the index here.

137
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.540
So next turn now, Alice, to those you wrote.

138
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:59.010
New to Libya less one lot.

139
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.540
But then it will.

140
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.980
And true.

141
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.860
So.

142
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:08.980
Here, Don?

143
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:10.840
No.

144
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.060
What should we do?

145
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.110
Go to the election matter.

146
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.790
And here we will write a new

147
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.600
labels on.

148
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.850
Here we will give barometer to counter.

149
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.380
Doesn't seem that.

150
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.830
Okay.

151
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.940
So here after counter increment, what should we do?

152
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:55.010
We have done this part of it so we can call that thing again.

153
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:08.090
We need an input labels parameter with the counter and here also.

154
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:18.180
We have to write a new blueprint on the parameter of control.

155
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.810
And now we will run our class.

156
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.680
This part has been handled.

157
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.840
And after this.

158
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.340
Again.

159
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.900
If it makes.

160
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.190
No, you.

161
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.030
Here.

162
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.570
Another has been indexed six or both.

163
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.680
Okay.

164
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:08.640
So we have to check this out or to connect with anyone.

165
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.970
We were two minus one.

166
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.920
Simply run again.

167
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.280
I'm fine.

168
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.310
So here.

169
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:35.180
No.

170
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.430
I don't know what you do.

171
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.380
I have created a button to play again.

172
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:52.970
And here I also have given Charlie one message which will give us you are launched or you have it.

173
00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:04.070
So simply take a button here and put it here and go to the properties and simply change the text here.

174
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.350
Play again and.

175
00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.470
These simply.

176
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.360
Okay.

177
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.280
Here.

178
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.440
Change the color.

179
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.510
Do.

180
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.230
Da da.

181
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.220
Lose.

182
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.820
Boone.

183
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.140
No set action to this button.

184
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.760
What we have to do.

185
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:51.000
We have to reset everything with this button.

186
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.540
Right.

187
00:14:54.150 --> 00:15:03.960
So when the user click the play button, all thing will be reset and start with the zero.

188
00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:10.470
So what we will do, we can do one thing.

189
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.720
We need more display message.

190
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:21.270
Okay, so we're done properly.

191
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.440
Table.

192
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.010
Okay.

193
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.550
So what can we do?

194
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.360
We can hear, right?

195
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.630
Random images matter.

196
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:42.240
And after this, we have to remove.

197
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.550
Images from Chile police.

198
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:49.900
Okay.

199
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.740
So here we will take off for loop.

200
00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:02.470
What we will do, we will take a for each loop and take the j label.

201
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:13.620
You'd put titanium alloy wheels, cologne labels under the body.

202
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.540
Right, Olivia.

203
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.840
Let's set it to zero.

204
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:25.500
Third set, I turn to the null

205
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.290
and see similar reverse set.

206
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.580
The obvious one not set icon.

207
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.560
You make it to the unknown again.

208
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.660
No.

209
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.720
Simply, we don't know the program and check the thing.

210
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.370
So here we will play our game.

211
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.370
Let's fix this and simply play again.

212
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.640
Okay, so working.

213
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.090
We have to do one more thing.

214
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:29.850
We would write a label player, finish the dark side by going here, search icon and null and make the

215
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.910
counter equal to zero.

216
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:38.460
We have to start with the finish and run it through, of course.

217
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:45.530
So on set here and now, we have done the top part here.

218
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.690
Simply run our program and check something.

219
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.390
Right.

220
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.680
Okay.

221
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.080
Yeah.

222
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.650
Everything is good.

223
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:21.460
Now, I told you that I have use here a cheer label to show us that you have won or you have lost.

224
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.080
Message to the user.

225
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:36.070
So I have taken a little part and it to the label message which will show it to the user when he lost

226
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.650
or she lost or won or not.

227
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:47.320
So what we will do, we have to go to our program here and.

228
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.740
To induce.

229
00:18:54.620 --> 00:19:04.900
Go in the component one here on off to finish we have to write g label.

230
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.240
Message.

231
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.740
Dodd said text.

232
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.830
No subtext thanks to.

233
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.360
You're sent to.

234
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.910
You have.

235
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.690
One here, one

236
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.550
in this event.

237
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:40.490
Right.

238
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:45.810
Okay.

239
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.520
So please finish.

240
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.430
Julian Assange.

241
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.890
We need to swing this through.

242
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.200
And what we need.

243
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.780
Just trust year we have.

244
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.430
Okay.

245
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.390
You have an ulcer.

246
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.460
We need to take a look here.

247
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.130
And what we will do?

248
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.870
We will write this condition again.

249
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.740
To counter.

250
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:55.280
Go do if is equal to images are there not length minus one and one is equal to false here?

251
00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:04.430
So what it will do, it will print a g label message.

252
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.010
Lord said text.

253
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.670
We need a subtext here.

254
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:25.460
This one and what we will show you have not.
