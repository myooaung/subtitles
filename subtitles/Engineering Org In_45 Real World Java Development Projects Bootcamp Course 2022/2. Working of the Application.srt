00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,850
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:09,450
So I hope that you all have went through the introduction Pat pretty well and now must be wondering

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,780
that how actually the application is going to work.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:23,040
So in this part we are here to look how actually things are going to work and what are the functionalities

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,340
to be attached to by making this application.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,620
What are the features that should be kept in mind before the creation of the programming section?

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,520
That BE?

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,100
We have to put up things in the programming section according to the other things which are already

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,700
in our mind.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:50,370
Like we have to make a column for the order, for the size, for the progress renderer, for the speed,

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,330
for the average speed, and for the elapsed time and remaining time as well.

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:05,040
And last but not least, the status bar is going to show the actual status of the download file taking

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,670
place.

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:15,000
Also, we are having buttons as pause, resume, cancel and clear, and these buttons also contain some

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
functionalities within them.

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:25,510
So we have to also like put the things according to these buttons like how on selecting a specific columns,

17
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,320
pause, resume, cancel and clear is going to work.

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,940
So this is the like opening window of the application.

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,020
Once you click on the icon of the application, this window will open with title bar containing a download

20
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,630
manager logo here and also in the taskbar a blue download arrow.

21
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:55,140
Downward Arrow is the icon of this application we are going to make the today and secondly of file text

22
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,980
is showing in the title bar as well.

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,590
So files are going to be downloaded with the help of this download manager.

24
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,670
So yes, file download manager.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,390
We can also say this.

26
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,830
This is the third row.

27
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,380
Like we can say that the second row after the title row.

28
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:24,630
So this is containing an input text will here we can enter any text from our keyboard and add download

29
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:33,520
button is like place placed side wise to the input text field where the link is to be pasted.

30
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,220
Now after this, we are having our downloads column.

31
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,850
Like we can see that this is the download table.

32
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:52,320
The table model is displayed once we will start like downloading anything, we can see that yes, it

33
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,690
is actually looking like a table with several rows and columns.

34
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:07,800
So let us try to like grab a link from the web and try downloading it from our download manager.

35
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,860
So suppose like okay, so opening any random pdf.

36
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:25,450
And copying the link of that pdf and then switching back to our download manager and pasting the link

37
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,820
in that input text field.

38
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,920
So yes, here we are.

39
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:40,830
We have pasted a link with HTP URL control or this link is for I think a Java tutorial book.

40
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,270
So yes, now we will hit this add download and see what happens.

41
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,500
Okay.

42
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,810
So that download has started.

43
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,630
It is working perfectly fine.

44
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:00,690
Had the URL column is showing that you are as we have pasted her and it is like vanish from here.

45
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:10,100
And now displaying that this URL column of the table the size of the file is five and the remaining

46
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:21,960
time is like zero as nothing is like to be waited for the total time to talk for this download is 24

47
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,850
seconds.

48
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,720
So the status is complete.

49
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,240
Let us try pasting the link again in order to like study things.

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,170
Okay.

51
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:38,480
So initially we have 48 seconds in the remaining time and now.

52
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,830
Okay, so these are varying the status is showing download.

53
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:50,900
Now let us try to select this column and pause in order to like study things it is downloading so fast.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,670
Okay, so one thing you have to keep in mind that you have to like switch on the network connection

55
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:07,010
of your system, like check if you have correctly connected your system to internet in order to like

56
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,430
check this download manager is working so.

57
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,660
Sometimes we do not connect to the Internet and then try to download something, then things are not

58
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,310
going to work fine.

59
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:29,040
So in the progress bar it is showing 53% completed and the download is paused.

60
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:37,290
Right now we have a remaining time of 18 seconds and elapsed time of 14 seconds, and the average speed

61
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,990
is different in both the columns.

62
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:48,510
So I have already told you that the network bandwidth may vary according to like a different time.

63
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,570
We have different speeds of the internet.

64
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,120
So for the same size we are having different average speeds.

65
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,740
Okay, so this is the speed at the current instant and this is the average speed.

66
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,830
Now let us try to resume this download.

67
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,170
So we have resumed this.

68
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,510
Now it is again showing download.

69
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,590
Now let us try to again cancel this.

70
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:23,340
Okay, so we have cancelled this download and the status now is showing cancel.

71
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:34,560
So we have a total of 21 second elapsed and then we cancel this download now after cancelling any download.

72
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:42,740
Suppose we want to clear this from the row which we are like, Suppose I have selected this and I want

73
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,900
to clear this row from the table download table.

74
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,600
So after the selecting the colour changes of that specific row, initially the colour is right.

75
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,150
Now the color is like a light blue colour showing that this column is selected.

76
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:07,760
So on hitting this clear, okay, so that specific column is managed, that specific row is managed.

77
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,060
The second link which was in download.

78
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:19,880
So now that we have completed one download now let us try to download something else.

79
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:28,760
Okay, so we have downloaded this teach your self java in 21 days and introduction.

80
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,340
Suppose we want to download this book.

81
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:40,280
So copying the link and again trying to paste the initially we have pasted the same links in order to

82
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,250
check how actually pausing and playing works.

83
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:50,960
So again, we are trying to paste someone differently and again this is containing a step, you are

84
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,890
in control.

85
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,980
So now on hitting that download button, the download has started again.

86
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,940
This is a five megabyte set and you can see that download is speed is very fast, it is downloaded in

87
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,590
just 5 seconds.

88
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,900
So you can see the difference.

89
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,750
Like suddenly the average speed jumps to four times.

90
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:23,870
So you can like analyze everything on this download manager, you can analyze the average speed of a

91
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,580
specific download, you can analyze the total time elapsed.

92
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,210
And thus, according to this size, it's okay.

93
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,010
So support.

94
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,740
Let us try to download a big file.

95
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:38,380
So.

96
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,210
So let us see that we can find a big file or not.

97
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,100
So.

98
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,460
Okay, so this is our big book, I think.

99
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:56,110
Let us try to copy this link and try pasting to check whether it works or not.

100
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:04,540
So yes, hitting on this ad download again, this is a state control file, but there is some error.

101
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:13,930
So okay, so if a link has some bugs attached to it, then automatically the status bar will show error.

102
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:22,420
So we have like opened up another feature of this download manager that if our link is like somewhere

103
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:31,270
broken or anything, then the status will show our error message that okay, wait, so we cannot download

104
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:38,230
this file as there are some errors, so let us try downloading something else.

105
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,380
Oh.

106
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:39,940
So.

107
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,300
Okay.

108
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,180
So opening this pdf file.

109
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,890
And.

110
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,190
Let us check whether this works or not.

111
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,890
Or, again, it shows that.

112
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,060
So they started downloading.

113
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,030
The source size is 5.6 megabytes.

114
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,570
And again, we have a different tablet speed.

115
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:17,280
So for three downloads, we have three different like the average speed and speeds in cable.

116
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,890
So the time elapsed is also different almost.

117
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:32,420
They are same size files, but the time difference is like not compatible once we so okay so we have

118
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,420
three complete status downloads and an error status download file.

119
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,080
So let us try to again clear the.

120
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,460
Down error of one file.

121
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,640
So we have cleared the error, one file.

122
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:57,710
Now you can see that we have a table like structure with three rows and one, two, three, four, five,

123
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,090
six, eight columns.

124
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:04,800
So we have three rows and eight columns and basically it is a table like structure.

125
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:14,000
So in order to like start the programming section of this project, we have to analyze that what are

126
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,340
actually required in order to.

127
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,010
Start making this project.

128
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:25,640
Okay, so what are the things to be kept in mind before creation of this application?

129
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:34,190
The first thing to be kept in mind is that we have to like create a new project.

130
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,720
In the I.D..

131
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,190
Okay.

132
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:49,710
After which we have to start creating the classes that are required inside the application.

133
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,750
So I think we will need like a let start one by one.

134
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:04,700
So the main class, so creating the main class and we can name the main class anyway.

135
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:14,540
But this class is going to be responsible for testing and running of the application.

136
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:22,590
So yes, our testing and running of the application is going to be handled with the help of this main

137
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,180
class.

138
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:30,620
Now, our third concern should be to like, yes, we had our progress renderer.

139
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,990
So create a class.

140
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,670
For progress.

141
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:48,920
We have already discussed that approx six to like 5 to 6 columns in the tables are like linked to each

142
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,450
other.

143
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,180
So everything is linked to the progress renderer.

144
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,570
Things are going to be varied according to the percentage displayed in the progress renderer.

145
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,860
So we have to create a create a class for the progress renderer.

146
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:10,730
Then the next concern is to create a like table module class.

147
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,200
So create a table model.

148
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,680
So we are creating a table basically.

149
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,250
So table model, class for table model.

150
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,430
So class for table model.

151
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:33,710
And inside this class, the things are going to be like combined accordingly, how the model is going

152
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:41,450
to be looked, how many columns are going to be placed inside the table, and how the links are to be

153
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,280
rendered one by one.

154
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,860
Once we like hit on that download button, the row will be added with a new download link, whether

155
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:59,300
it is in progress or paused or like complete, or whether it may be an error file also.

156
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,500
So the row is going to be like occupied one by one.

157
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:11,540
Once we hit that download button with our link every time, again and again, things are going to be

158
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,350
added in the row.

159
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:21,200
Okay, so our next concern should be like, yes, we have created the main class, we have created the

160
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,750
progress renderer and we are done with the download table also like table model.

161
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:36,410
Also now we have to add one more class for the rest of the columns like see what we have left, the

162
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,850
size thing, the status thing and the time thing.

163
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:53,030
So the fourth class is going to cover all the things about that time status changing and like what is

164
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,200
the next thing?

165
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,710
So size thing.

166
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:04,880
So we are going to make a class for handling the functions, methods, objects of time, status and

167
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,510
size, class size columns.

168
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,850
Okay.

169
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:19,220
So we are going to handle all the columns in a separate class in our separate class.

170
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,720
So okay.

171
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,170
So this is all about the working of this project.

172
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,830
We are going to meet now in the next part.

173
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,170
We will start the programming section.

174
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,970
So see you in the next part.
