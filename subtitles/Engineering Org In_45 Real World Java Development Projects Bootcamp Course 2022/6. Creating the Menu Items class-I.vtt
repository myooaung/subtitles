WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:08.420
So in the previous part, we have created objects for size, amount and size, which is going to be

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.530
displayed here.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.060
That five medium glasses of water with ice is added.

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.060
So as a whole, this text is displayed in the form of a string.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:29.060
But this five is integer and the price we have set which will be displayed later like this, which you

6
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.090
should pay 12.5.

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.990
So this is double, but still this is also displayed as a string.

8
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:47.060
So we have to simply override this all the data types and set the override and set all the data types

9
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.840
to string.

10
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.590
So this is done with the help of public string to string method is our feature of Java, which we use

11
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.580
to convert all the text, like whether it be integer, double float or string anything.

12
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.240
Just simply all of the data types are converted to string and displayed as a whole.

13
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.520
Basically this returns all the items as string format.

14
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.340
So string format.

15
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.150
And inside this the format is going to be called an argument.

16
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.430
So what is the format?

17
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:38.210
We should use modulus to set the data types like suppose percent d is for integer percent as is for

18
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.500
double and plus subclass.

19
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.430
As suppose there are more than one classes.

20
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.930
So we are adding classes to make things.

21
00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:02.290
So class is defined as are for the characters self care and these foreign teachers.

22
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.570
Glasses off.

23
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.560
And this format is completed now in the argument section.

24
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:21.060
We will be using the objects with the help of this keyword as a private global variable for access to

25
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.020
the helper.

26
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.300
This only so arguments are going to be destroyed.

27
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.510
Get around and separating them.

28
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:40.410
Also this not a second thing is size, so get size as string form.

29
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.420
So now that we have converted all the string in the all the text in the form of string, whether it

30
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.550
be double or integer, we have converted everything.

31
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:03.750
This is for the like amount which is in the integer format and the size which is in the form of string.

32
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.950
So percent days for this get amount and.

33
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:17.360
On this exercise is covered in the format part with the help of person test access specified.

34
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.450
So we have completed this beverage dot to Java class.

35
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:33.410
Now our next concern is going to be to create four more classes associated with all the menu items.

36
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:43.610
So the first item I am going to add inside this SLC folder is going to be coffee dot java, which will

37
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:54.290
be containing all the add ons and like the text appearing in the dialog box associated with like suppose

38
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.240
if we click coffee in the button and then press add button.

39
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:08.120
So before adding the coffee to the cart, the dialog box was a pairing so that all the dialog box thing

40
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.590
that something will be covered inside this coffee class only.

41
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:22.880
So suppose inside this coffee class we are declaring or boolean object and call it as milk.

42
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.240
So the add on to the coffee was milk.

43
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.240
We have discussed it in the introduction, but only now.

44
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.030
Inside the coffee class we will be creating or constructor containing coffee object.

45
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.250
So yes.

46
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:53.810
And the arguments inside this constructor is going to be the size like how many glasses of coffee we

47
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.950
want to order?

48
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.500
What is the amount?

49
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.740
Like how much price is attached.

50
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.640
So integer amount and also level.

51
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.590
The label.

52
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.810
Is responsible for.

53
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.590
The label, which was added with every menu item.

54
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.860
So we have imported all that you inside this constructor.

55
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.710
So this class is an extension to the beverage class.

56
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.240
So extends the beverage now inside this.

57
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.860
So we have to override first.

58
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.720
Then only the error will be gone.

59
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.520
So oversight and public.

60
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.370
Public string to string.

61
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.430
So this string is going to.

62
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.660
Convert all the other data types to a string format.

63
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.330
Oh, yes.

64
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:21.420
Now, after this, we will be adding now in the next part, inside the coffee constructor, we are using

65
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:33.880
this super keyword for the size and amount of the like, coffee to be ordered and setting if condition

66
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:44.670
in inside this if statement it is going to ask us for or whether we want to add milk to our coffee or

67
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.240
not.

68
00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:57.210
So show confirm so dialog box will appear and inside this or label will be seen and the message is it

69
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.590
is going to like ask for is would you.

70
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.150
Like milk.

71
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.810
Like to add milk.

72
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.150
Okay.

73
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:22.280
So, yes, this is going to be asked and after this, also the mail option pane will appear asking for

74
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.500
a yes or no.

75
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.600
So after this option pane.

76
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.660
Dot.

77
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.450
Yes.

78
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.980
No option it is going to ask for.

79
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.930
So yes.

80
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.650
Yes.

81
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.420
No option is covered.

82
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.820
And us after this there should be an L statement also.

83
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:49.840
So if the user selects yes, then milk should be set to true.

84
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.660
Or we have declared this as a global variable.

85
00:07:52.660 --> 00:08:01.900
Had a boolean milk was declared above and if this happens then milk is set to true.

86
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.830
Otherwise inside the milk is set to false.

87
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:13.330
After this we are going to discuss the price thing that what is going to be the price of the milk.

88
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.680
So like the coffee with milk and coffee without the milk.

89
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:27.610
So suppose if the user adds a small or medium or a large coffee so the prices should be different in

90
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.600
each case.

91
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.300
So setting the prices in that manner.

92
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.220
So suppose the user selects for size equals small.

93
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.980
So if the size is small, the price should be 3.5 units.

94
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.680
As if the size is medium, then the price is going to be five.

95
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.190
You can set it to 5.0.

96
00:08:50.200 --> 00:09:00.130
So as we have double data type for the price, also, if there is no medium and no small, so of course

97
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.630
it is going to be large.

98
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.710
So we have set its price to 6.5.

99
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:12.370
You can also write it as if size equals large price, but that is not required here.

100
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.600
Simply if it is not medium and small, it is definitely large.

101
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:24.220
So these three are the prices set for each of the sizes and there is a unique price for each size.

102
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.660
Now if our user wants to add milk, so if milk.

103
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.850
So this is going to contain arguments as true and false.

104
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:41.260
So suppose this boolean milk is true, then price is going to be multiplied with 1.5.

105
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:49.300
So suppose if we have ordered medium sized coffee and added milk to it, then size is going to be multiplied

106
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.710
with 1.5.

107
00:09:50.710 --> 00:10:02.590
So five and 1.5 is going to be like, okay, so 7.5 calculations are made and according to that only

108
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.500
and the price is set.

109
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.310
So suppose you have our order, the medium coffee with milk, a single glass of medium coffee.

110
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.840
So the price is set to 7.5 units.

111
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:23.620
Now we are done with this inside this override option we are using.

112
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:30.250
If milk is true, then we have to display the label or import label.

113
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.530
According to that only this report label.

114
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:40.870
Suppose 5 million glasses of coffee with milk added is going to be displayed in this report label and

115
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:50.830
that is done with the help of this override two string function and this is returning super to string

116
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.080
the super, we have called it here and this is responsible for that.

117
00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:07.330
So this is converting the amount and the size of the coffee part to a string format and then displaying

118
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.110
to that.

119
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:15.880
So if milk is added, it is going to display that specific text width plus coffee with milk.

120
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:23.320
And if that is normal, then it is simply going to get done at five medium glasses of coffee or whatever

121
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.410
we selected in that manner only.

122
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:34.690
So these things are done for the coffee class and we have completed the coffee class functionality.

123
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:43.150
Now our next concern is going to be that the water and the juice class, so we will be creating three

124
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:52.570
more classes in order to complete this application, our Java Water dot Java and you start Java and

125
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.660
then we'll add a similar dialog box.

126
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.710
Functionality is a dedicated price to that.

127
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:06.070
Also add ons will be a test in that menu only, so we will see that in the next part.

128
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.940
Till then, try this on your own and write the code and write it in your IDE.
