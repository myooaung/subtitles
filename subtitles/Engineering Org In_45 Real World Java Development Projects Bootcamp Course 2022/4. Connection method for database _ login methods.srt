1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:08,720
In previous sessions and tutorials, I told you how we can set up our project and we created an index

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,700
HTML for the loading page.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,480
So it contains two links for admin log in, which is basically for teachers and students.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,740
Log in for those students.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,340
So let us see how we can show the student log in page.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,440
So this is our student log in page.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,000
Remember, this is JSP.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,280
So we can include some Java.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,670
Classes on weekends in Texas, also year.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,370
So we can do that.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,990
So this is all about the case and I'm using bootstrap just for all these things.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,670
And this is tiny because I don't want to create another file for CSIS so I could be embedded here only.

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,350
So this is all about.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,780
But remember, what is this?

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,370
If our gate parameter is null, like if we are not putting something on username or password, it should

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,730
enter enter username and password first.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,440
That's all the message things here and because dot get parameter is getting parameter from that part.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:16,200
Similarly again, this is for if our validation is successful, it will show the message in the green

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,650
part.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:24,440
So this is very important part for my actions, which is using validated student as action.

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,850
So what is this first USB dot controller?

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,000
As I told you, we are going to create when.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:35,100
So package insert package which contains another package controller which contains validates through

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,500
the controller, is basically controlling all the parts.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,010
So I'm dividing my for my convenience, although Java codes, Java servlet codes.

26
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,940
So the user ID field which takes username and password, which takes password, if I click exit, it

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:58,920
will go to the first page and if I click submit, it should go to the that part and validate that part.

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,390
So similarly for the admin page, as I told you here, I'm going to use method validated.

29
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,220
So let us see how we can create validate student part.

30
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,070
So valid for the validate student you just need to create one.

31
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,370
So package inside us and controller and you can create new hours on it.

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,310
So I'm importing all libraries here, then I'm importing.

33
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,030
All packages.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,590
So here I'm going to use database package, which is what is database package?

35
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:42,210
So it will contain all the database searching part and model contents, all the log in and log logic

36
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,930
and everything.

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,370
So what is it?

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,820
Student It's actually overwriting.

39
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,440
I'm using overwriting method here.

40
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,460
So validate.

41
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,980
Student Will use this validated student as a super method and then using the due course method, I'm

42
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,320
going to search that you name and first name.

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,320
And for this I'm going to create students which is basically checking that part.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,060
I'm using Boolean path here.

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,460
So this is just for the what we can see controlling part of that JSP.

46
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,040
If our organization is correct, it should go to the student instruction.

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,580
JSP.

48
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:23,150
Further, I'm going to create one student instruction in JSP file because if you know, like you on

49
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,960
some online portal and you just click that on the login, it should go to the instruction page or something

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,620
like that.

51
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,770
It should be needed if not go to that part plus message with message like invalid user.

52
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,260
As I told you, this message should be printed.

53
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,280
So these are all about the validates.

54
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,930
Let me say this.

55
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,760
So.

56
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,870
I'm overwriting method.

57
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:56,060
Remember that you can override this method with the serial version id and these all things are the same

58
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,140
and default.

59
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,740
As I told you, no need to change these things, but you can change your own things here and your own

60
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,340
logic.

61
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,900
I'm using this logic.

62
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,420
So these are all about value.

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,770
Shouldn't same as validate admin.

64
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:20,100
I am mentioning all the libraries because you can use star, but I want to specify each and every library

65
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,390
here.

66
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,710
So I use this.

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:31,270
Then which extends to a should be solid similar method it takes you name or from admin login jsp.

68
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,620
You name and pass this name and pass it will take it will check for that admin.

69
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,220
It should go to the admin panel if username is correct.

70
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,020
And if not, it should go to that same page admin login.

71
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,390
So remember in so lit you have to use forward method.

72
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,140
Here you have to use response dots in direct.

73
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,000
If not, you are going to use the same direct to that particular part.

74
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,950
So no need to include that forward and include method only to use that part.

75
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,480
You can use only one method.

76
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,650
Send direct part here.

77
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,520
So again, this is the STB session is handled as in JSP or Java, I can tell you.

78
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,060
So in due post you have to use gdb session.

79
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,230
No need to use http servlet and all these things.

80
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:25,380
I'm I'm using http solid to fetch data, but for the forwarding part you need to use this.

81
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,710
Which attribute also.

82
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,160
Your attribute should be same because I'm going to print attribute like welcome student or welcome that

83
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,910
admin part.

84
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,680
So this is all about this.

85
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,330
So let us see how we can create one database featuring part and everything.

86
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,460
So before database teaching part, I need to mention the connection.

87
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,410
Or we can say we need to create connection.

88
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,110
I am using here another dedicated Java file for the connection.

89
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,540
But why?

90
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,900
Why I'm using this.

91
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,810
So in each and every connection, like for I mean, then students, then questions, then instructions.

92
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,210
All of these are stored in their database.

93
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:11,560
So for all these purposes, for storing the questions and everything again and again, I'm going to

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,810
create a connection.

95
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:20,680
So if I use methods and I implement some object oriented logic here, I can easily create this method.

96
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,120
So let us see.

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,630
First, create is DB or file here.

98
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,270
Why I'm specifying this package because.

99
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,410
I am going to use as a sub packaging material, so it is not DB for storing the databases file.

100
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,820
So this is another my provider.

101
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,280
I am switching that provider, this provider.

102
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,620
So this is good.

103
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,050
You can always use this actually.

104
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,060
No need to specify everything.

105
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,050
Just put this.

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,420
It will ask for everything.

107
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,250
And I am including the libraries.

108
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,730
This very simple thing then provided as a class study connection, basically, because you know, for

109
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:04,310
that purpose you need to create connection, get Oracle connection, basically.

110
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,410
Then connection.

111
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,020
It should be it.

112
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,810
You are.

113
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,790
I can told you it should be allowed.

114
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,130
You can directly put connection here.

115
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,440
Also know or do that all things you can put connection and is equal to this.

116
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,330
But I'm creating this part again.

117
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,340
Right?

118
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,870
Always handle the school connections and with inside the try only or you can use throws also here but

119
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,340
I'm using edge as a exception part exception catching part.

120
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:39,860
This is for Oracle database then this is system, my user name or that Oracle database password for

121
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,490
passing.

122
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:46,430
Then this is all for get connection user read pass.

123
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,690
If this is correct, it will show that connection is successful inside this.

124
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,610
If not, it will provide some error or exception inside this out.

125
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,610
But what we can say our command prompt.

126
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:06,500
So I'm creating one dedicated I have created already this part for connection so this is our provider

127
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,750
is over it or dedicated connection java file for builder connection.

128
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,550
So let us see how we can create admins.

129
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,300
Java file.

130
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,750
So inside the admin java.

131
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,200
What I'm doing is.

132
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,910
I am featuring all from that database.

133
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,870
Or we can say we are providing it into the database and I am returning it.

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,270
So this is very simple part which I already created.

135
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,920
It's very, very easy.

136
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,290
Which is basically pre count.

137
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,720
So this is very basic thing and username and password and I'm putting the git username, string username,

138
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,610
gate password, set password as our primary sensor.

139
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:54,270
So I'm just using that variable and I'm assigning to another variable.

140
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,040
So this is very easy.

141
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,190
Students.

142
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:05,150
Dot Java is also SIM, which is using this database, but it's very easy.

143
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,410
I'm just doing same stuff as admin.

144
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:16,610
I'm putting in this and I'm returning that part and I'm storing in dedicated same string name and all

145
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:16,970
these things.

146
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,560
So this will be easy.

147
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,540
Same for the question part.

148
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,560
I'm what for the question great question is for the great question.

149
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,000
State question is to set the question like the question for user side, but or we can say student side,

150
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,420
but that question is for the admin side or teacher's side.

151
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,320
Get a means for optional then say it for that purpose.

152
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,910
Get B for.

153
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,040
No student said before another student, get c, c, c, get D.

154
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,170
I'm currently sitting the four options only get answer answered answer.

155
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,740
That's it.

156
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,560
So the answer is for sitting that answer or get answer for admin part.

157
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,460
Then instructions draw Java.

158
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,060
So.

159
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,740
This again, same state instruction guides instruction.

160
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,200
So the book contains all the files which just creating the connection part.

161
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,720
So this is all about this.

162
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:18,340
Now, let us see how we can create one thing here, which is basically admin, the one student deal.

163
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,190
So I told you about that.

164
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,470
How we can create admin java file and remember why I'm using this admin here.

165
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,340
So if you see the admin is where it is used.

166
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:36,190
I'm using this new admins and I'm set username and I'm setting the password.

167
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,330
So when I say so, I will put your.

168
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,220
Creating.

169
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,980
Object.

170
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,860
So this is setting the password.

171
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,960
So why am using this?

172
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,600
Like I'm switching from one, I'm setting it to the another variable and I'm using this.

173
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,540
So it is very common method in Java.

174
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,560
If I'm using the same variable, it will change its value again.

175
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,240
Then again, like if I put admin username and password is Edwin and I want to change that part, but

176
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,770
I want to store that admin admin, I want to add it or append it in the admins so it will help.

177
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:26,320
If I'm not using this part like I'm switching from one variable from I'm fetching data from user side

178
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,670
and I'm storing it to the same variable and I'm using same variable again and again.

179
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,010
Then there can be an anomaly or we can say there can be some security issue.

180
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,770
Also, like you can easily find the answer of our questions or anything.

181
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:48,040
So putting into the another file, it will create some dedicated file for that purpose.

182
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,040
So I'm setting this username and password method.

183
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,930
And I'm using that validated.

184
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,540
So I'm using this part.

185
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,980
Or and it will send to the admin panel.

186
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,400
We will create an admin panel for that purpose and further reduce use.

187
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,360
I'm going to tell you how we can develop a JSP files only because we are mostly done with our Java files

188
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:16,740
required I think, or 2 to 3 only remaining for that purposes.

189
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:23,640
And in the controller we required to create some log out, log in all out for admin, log for student,

190
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:30,000
then question insert method student insert method also and some instruction insert methods also.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,660
So that's it.

192
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:37,590
But mostly we are done with our Java file, so we are now only focused with our JSP files only.

193
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,300
So this is all about how we can create.

194
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,170
So let us see how we can create student the method.

195
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,680
I'm going to use method to validate which is basically boolean which tells us status as false or so

196
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,810
what it will be do.

197
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,450
It will checking for the connection.

198
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,840
Then db provider as I told you and student Pat.

199
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:08,520
So it will help me to check everything and I am passing in line object you can say for that or inline

200
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,200
thing.

201
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,450
So do you basically construct or not?

202
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,320
So I'm going to use this again, as I told you, as the get user name from student method and get password

203
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,680
from that student method as a let us see how we can.

204
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,270
I told you here this is get username and get password method.

205
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,220
So I'm using this.

206
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:36,900
So from provider dot get Oracle connection, which is basically our provider dot java file only.

207
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,960
So this will use this again.

208
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,940
Recognition.

209
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:52,930
Then no need to require to create another thing like as I am using this DB dot provider which is basically

210
00:13:52,930 --> 00:14:00,340
specific file, I'm using your I'm not mentioning only DB here so I can use this provider to get connection

211
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,520
here which is basically fully defined name.

212
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,040
Or we can say I'm using this string to fetch that part.

213
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,880
I will again print here like a school.

214
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,170
So this is clearly for the user ID and password.

215
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,960
So in for other things, I'm going to create tables in the database.

216
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,150
I will tell you which queries you have to use and this is all for the setting.

217
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:31,900
The name Evo is due to set name, which is basically we are setting name here and our string string

218
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,820
is equal in the name basically.

219
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,740
So it will return true.

220
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,100
If not ls false, it will catch the statement.

221
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,550
Similarly for the insert student, I'm creating another thing because I don't want to create one another

222
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,470
file to insert students and everything.

223
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:55,280
So I just created then get all records from the ArrayList because from the student table I want to check

224
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,510
for all student lists.

225
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,040
I can use a list here.

226
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:05,870
Similar thing you can use and remember always first time clear that and again printing that because

227
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,740
there may be some two names also inside that part.

228
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,000
So I'm using this.

229
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,820
And delete records.

230
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:20,350
I'm adding the delete record method also and get student name method also you are then do update new

231
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,960
record because I want to update new record also.

232
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,560
So this is all the methods you can minimize methods you're also.

233
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,910
So this will be the part you can check for this.

234
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,880
It's very easy, but it takes too much time because I created in only one single method, which is basically

235
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,840
student video.

236
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,840
So this is all about student in further batch I'm going to create you can create how you can create

237
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,820
the admin part, then inserting part and everything.
