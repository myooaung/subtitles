1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.610
In previous cases.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.610
I told you how we already created this part.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:15.000
So we created one data service client to request and print the response for this purpose.

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.470
So.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.840
If you know these, all the things are currently not mentioned here.

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.130
Let me do one thing.

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.130
Let me.

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.530
Comment out this part because I'm not using this currently.

9
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.400
And.

10
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.230
Let me do one thing.

11
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.280
Let me print location stats because I'm using that location stats here.

12
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.800
As you know.

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.870
Is there any error?

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.190
No, not currently.

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.120
Any error is shown?

16
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.420
No.

17
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.680
So let me what I'm going to do is system.

18
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.460
Dodd out.

19
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.950
Dodd Dylan.

20
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.300
Location strikes.

21
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.730
Our locations.

22
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.170
So that's it.

23
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.610
And what I'm going to do.

24
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.660
Let me.

25
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.390
Then COVID tracker application.

26
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.150
You can run from here also, but.

27
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.580
I'm going in here.

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.840
And this is our main retort to everything.

29
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.340
So currently it's running our method.

30
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.340
Let me check in build.

31
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.520
Yeah.

32
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.600
It's running, and it will print the output for us.

33
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.630
You can see the Java compiler using everything here.

34
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.970
And let me check.

35
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.070
What is going to bring here?

36
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.500
We started.

37
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.830
So as you can see, these are the location statistics it is giving basically.

38
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.730
We have application, each general, everything.

39
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.040
These are the old things.

40
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.240
After some time it will run it again and it will print mere statistics.

41
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.490
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to comment this because.

42
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.760
I'm not going to print or console.

43
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.610
I just want to create one another thing here.

44
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.690
What we didn't inside models.

45
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.530
I already created location stats application.

46
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.110
So let me create one.

47
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.550
Private string or states because.

48
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.670
I'm using as a state then.

49
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.980
I would string country.

50
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.620
Let me told you just to.

51
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.320
Use this again.

52
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.930
Country for the country purpose.

53
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.100
Then when another integer for total cases and another for latest total cases.

54
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.950
I'm just using this.

55
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.380
So we are done with this.

56
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.750
Now, let me check.

57
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.310
Some instructors.

58
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.550
So you can say these are the methods here you can use here.

59
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.490
I want to get around certain methods, which is basically getting and generating.

60
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.660
So I want to use everything here.

61
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.880
Okay.

62
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.380
So.

63
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.270
It is for me.

64
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.370
It's already created, as you can see.

65
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.100
Great statement towards its statement to the contrary.

66
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.530
All the methods are mentioned here.

67
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.140
So what I'm going to do.

68
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.200
I'm going to.

69
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.230
I just come into this part first, but now I can use this part.

70
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.530
As you can see, we are using these methods and we are using these methods to get countries at country,

71
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.420
all the methods we are mentioned here.

72
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.690
So let us check what we are missing here.

73
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.110
The basic math is missing.

74
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.270
We are missing the two string method here.

75
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.540
So let me create one to string method.

76
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.620
Also here to insert to get to string method.

77
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.580
So.

78
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.100
Okay.

79
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.850
But as you can see, these are the all things I already created.

80
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.820
And no, not in this.

81
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
It is already printing me this all the data.

82
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.700
So this is inside the models.

83
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.470
Let me go to the package menu.

84
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.920
Well.

85
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.710
This is inside the models.

86
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.780
Location stats.

87
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.300
It continues Methodism in India and all the things are now loading.

88
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.670
So this is all about the location stats and everything.

89
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.630
But now the thing we are missing here is.

90
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.410
We need to create one controller.

91
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.890
Why?

92
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.000
We needed the controller to control our app as a web application.

93
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.510
So.

94
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.050
Let me keep this.

95
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.150
As it is.

96
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.670
And let me create one project.

97
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.890
Inside Edition models.

98
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.330
Then these services, then let me create one.

99
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.300
Another class.

100
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.760
Basically, I'm going to create here.

101
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.560
Which is basically comptroller.

102
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.180
So let me open one controller and why we need a controller.

103
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:58.250
As I already told you, the initial team of controllers is going to maintain our controlling part of

104
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.840
whom I'm going to create a only home file here.

105
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.440
I'm not pushing it till what we can say all the things here.

106
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.990
I just needed the home controller because we are going to create one home controller only.

107
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.090
I will hit the colors.

108
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.680
So I created this.

109
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.990
Let me tell you what is these things?

110
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.670
First, location, statistics.

111
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.470
Well, let me minimize this.

112
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.430
Let me just remove this.

113
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.840
Okay.

114
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.940
So this is the models.

115
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:39.860
I mentioned models as a package location, stat state, country, latest total cases different from

116
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.360
previous days.

117
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.770
Basically difference between the previous day and next day.

118
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.850
Get set method to that method.

119
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.250
State for this get country set state to print it straight.

120
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.750
Get country for getting that.

121
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.310
So we are not currently using this.

122
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.940
We are going to use it in home controller.

123
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.850
But before that.

124
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.250
Remember, we are using this get latest set latest these all the things we have mentioned here.

125
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.720
So let us see why the home controller is needed as this is.

126
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.080
I'm deploying on what we can say only a web app.

127
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.060
We need to create a win waiver application, but we are mentioning it only in this part.

128
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.200
So we need to.

129
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.390
Create one home controller app to control each and everything.

130
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.370
So let me create one.

131
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.830
Thank here which is basically a direct.

132
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.170
Controlling part.

133
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.180
So let me download first and.

134
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.740
Let me add one thing here.

135
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.270
Spring framework.

136
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.720
Basics.

137
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.400
Basically this thing and it.

138
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.140
Controller.

139
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:57.040
So it will accept the all the controlling part.

140
00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.710
As you can see, disease control.

141
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.600
It is like the studio type each and everything.

142
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.500
So now this can be controlled through a web.

143
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.290
So what is the thing I'm going to use here?

144
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.690
So I'm going to create list each and everything to deploy it on the web.

145
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:22.950
But before proceeding with web, we need to mention the what is going to it is going to use.

146
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.610
So.

147
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.710
Auto wire.

148
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.930
Why I'm using auto, let me tell you.

149
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.120
I'm going to mention throughout this Corona virus data services.

150
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.310
So let me copy this first.

151
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.710
Coronavirus Data Services because it is mentioned as a service.

152
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.810
I can use this as a service.

153
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.920
Which is basically the deplorable for me.

154
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.380
So let me enter.

155
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.440
So it will track me to this.

156
00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.910
And as I mentioned, we can use this as a service and it will be loaded throughout the this part.

157
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.660
So this is how we are going to do.

158
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.770
But we have mentioned some things here like packages each and every, etc..

159
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.600
So before this, let me create one.

160
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.960
And what we can say model or we can say.

161
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.740
Public.

162
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.550
String.

163
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.050
It's string.

164
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.150
Staying home.

165
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.220
Morell also.

166
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.780
I mentioned moral, but I needed moral, not morally.

167
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.330
Let me handle this.

168
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.590
It will accept this model, which is basically spring framework.

169
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.540
Let me add your model.

170
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.490
So this is going to create one model here to.

171
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.450
But in or out that part.

172
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.860
So if you know I already created this list.

173
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.630
With.

174
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.250
What is the name for that?

175
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.790
Let me check first, which is basically location stats.

176
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.010
Okay.

177
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.550
This only I need it.

178
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.500
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to create a controller here.

179
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.840
So I'm currently creating a controller.

180
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.980
Okay before this.

181
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:34.660
I need to mention all stats, each and every etc., because as I mentioned here, this is all stat,

182
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.610
only all stats.

183
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.530
And what is the name?

184
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.880
Basically, it's all stats.

185
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.750
Only all stats is capital.

186
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.220
Again.

187
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.330
Okay.

188
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.940
All stats.

189
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.450
On that note, here is data services.

190
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.070
Don't get all steps.

191
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.360
That's our method.

192
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.120
So let me one do one thing.

193
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.710
So it will accept that everything.

194
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.670
So this is all I created.

195
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.450
Now I need to create a map and each and everything.

196
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.450
But before the map, I need to create.

197
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.390
One thing here is.

198
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.860
And did it get mapping?

199
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.610
So when I needed a gate mapping because this is not mapped already, I need to map it.

200
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.940
And before the.

201
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.370
All the things are mapped.

202
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.230
Okay.

203
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.900
This is basically a strategic plan, but.

204
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.510
You can do anything.

205
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.680
Slash.

206
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.820
So it will.

207
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.200
It is the syntax for getting the map and each and everything here.

208
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.640
So this is it about how I'm going to do this.

209
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.140
But before this you have to mention each and everything here.

210
00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.210
So as you can see, you can create here open and you can check.

211
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.590
So my local client is 88 and my port is 88.

212
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:10.250
So I can run this and this is the API in the get client method.

213
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.700
So let me close this first because I haven't mentioned here.

214
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:21.250
So likewise, you can check your HTTP client method so my you can choose any.

215
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.400
Here, let me do one thing.

216
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.900
Let me delete this part.

217
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:26.790
Okay.

218
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.150
So these are all about how we are going to create a client here.

219
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.700
So I'm going to control this part all over the web application in the folder thing.

220
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.000
So I'm going to show you how I'm going to place that.

221
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.040
So I'm just getting the all stacks.

222
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.590
But in the videos I'm going to explain you.

223
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:50.550
I'm going to create one HTML file to display all the data using theme leave theme, basically to bring

224
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.300
that here.

225
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.780
I'm not mentioning any spring authentication part or etc..

226
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.570
This is just a spring boot application.

227
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.130
Anyone can use this to check the COVID data daily on a daily basis.

228
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.020
And why I'm telling you this is the daily basis because of this.

229
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.990
So it will be updated every month over.

230
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:16.190
Or we can say first our off date, which is basically 1 a.m. in the morning.

231
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.650
Then this year is updated.

232
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:28.670
So while I am mentioning this, is this very this what we can say not very useful part of our thing,

233
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:36.130
because it is when you go to this link, you can check it's updated every 26 minutes or 30, 30 minutes.

234
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.640
So identically, I have to use this at one second or one minute.

235
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:47.480
But thing or consider for the texting application, I can put checks of one aim of every day.

236
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.420
So if you want to create more efficient, you can change this part.

237
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.550
And this is a very useful thing.

238
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.660
It is not achieving under the percent abstraction, as I told you.

239
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:04.270
Because I'm not mentioning any abstraction class or anything, but I'm using packages and packages concept

240
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.710
to develop this.

241
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.490
And it's synchronous, as I told you.

242
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.990
While developing spring applications, you can go with asynchronous or synchronous method.

243
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.850
But I'm going with synchronous method.

244
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.680
As I told you, I created this part.

245
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.260
So this is very synchronous method.

246
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.760
And for the part, I'm going to create home controller part and in template part.

247
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.150
Also, I'm going to mention the templates, which is basically home template.

248
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.610
You can check the application properties each and everything here.

249
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:40.790
And currently this is the coronavirus data services returning your services basically going to face

250
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.390
the data.

251
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:51.080
We can cancel services, which is going to change the data model for what we can see, modelling the

252
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.420
data, we can say we can.

253
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.070
We are going to create methods only to display that.

254
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.810
So I haven't created these methods directly.

255
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:06.410
What I did is this insert in your thing and you can get generate method, you can put, get, get,

256
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:11.330
etc. etc. both methods equals and hashcode to string methods.

257
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.550
So this is all about how we are going to do.

258
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.670
You can use your copyright methods each and everything here.

259
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.630
So override methods.

260
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.430
So no need to worry about this part.

261
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.500
Why created this?

262
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.610
This is the system.

263
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:27.110
Default or idea will take care of creating all the things and this is the system we want no need to

264
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.640
worry about.

265
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.640
It's going to create.

266
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.850
It will detect your thing and it will print your data.

267
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.010
So hope you understand this part.

268
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.050
In the next part, I'm going to mention the home controller and each and everything.
