WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:11.040
We will create our next class and named it as main node java and we will create an object of this album.

2
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.490
So we'll create our main line here.

3
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.260
We have to create our main document object of this album.

4
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.110
So let's call it the album and let's call it album.

5
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.460
This thing is equal to the first thing is the name of the album.

6
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.590
And so let's have a random name.

7
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.300
Let's call it album one.

8
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.420
And do.

9
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.220
The we have to define the artist.

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.360
So the artist is, let's say, Billie Eilish.

11
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:57.720
So here we have created an album and we call this album as an album and the artist is the right.

12
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:06.000
So let's add a few songs inside it and it's all album dot and we have all the methods.

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.710
So the first is the add song and song and let's add a song.

14
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.110
So the first song is The Getting Older, which is a song by Billie Eilish, and her duration will be

15
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.160
the four point, let's say the 4.5 minutes, and let's write a few similar songs inside this.

16
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.740
And so this thing is called Let's See My Future.

17
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.300
And here this is 3.5 and another one is your power with duration 5.0.

18
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.500
This time we create a new album and this thing again album is equal to new album.

19
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.990
And the name of the album is Album two and the Artist is as.

20
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.990
So let's end a few songs.

21
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.500
So the first song that we have here is Dusty and the duration is 4.5 minutes.

22
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.720
And another song is that is Life Goes On and the duration is 3.5 minutes.

23
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.960
And the next song that we have here is the dynamite with 4.5 minute duration.

24
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.970
And now we have two albums, the album one and the album two, and we have to add this album to an ArrayList

25
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.690
of album.

26
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.000
So let's create an ArrayList here of Alonzo so private and this thing going to be static.

27
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.500
And let's add a list of album and let's call it album.

28
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.340
Album is equal to the new error.

29
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.140
ArrayList Right.

30
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.440
And let's add this album to ArrayList.

31
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.060
So

32
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:04.200
yeah, I released a return yeah here, which is an early start add and let's add this album similarly,

33
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.900
let's add the second album too, which is the release slot.

34
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.450
And here you have to pass in the album and let's add this album as well.

35
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.700
And we have the two albums and those two albums are added to our array list of album and what the next

36
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.400
thing that we can have is a linked list.

37
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.150
Of playlists.

38
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.050
So we have two albums.

39
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.430
Now let's create a link list of a playlist which contains the songs from these two albums.

40
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.610
So here are the link list.

41
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.380
First two of song and let's call it another playlist.

42
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.900
One is equal to the new list.

43
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.260
So we have created a linked list, and this link list is of song.

44
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.590
And let's add elements inside this long list.

45
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.290
So let's add the first song in the playlist.

46
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.000
So what the first we have to we need to exhaust the albums.

47
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.280
And so album which is an early start.

48
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.130
Yeah.

49
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.770
Start to get in here.

50
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:25.960
We have to pass an zero here album, not get past the zero because zero to Next contains this albums

51
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.230
of Billie Eilish solo album Don't Get Zero.

52
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:40.220
And we have this playlist method and we here we have the second one which is title and the link list

53
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.990
itself.

54
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.720
So this title was getting older and here we have to pass in the linked list.

55
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.780
This one, we have to pass the link list and there we have to add.

56
00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.800
So we have to simply pass the playlist and let's add a few similar songs and such.

57
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:10.950
So the first song is going to be of this Billie Eilish here, the getting older in the future and under

58
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.710
the.

59
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.130
No, the name is.

60
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.630
Yeah, we need to show them the same title that we have passed in here.

61
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:27.480
And the second time, this thing is going to be a valuable one, which is the diabetes.

62
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.450
So here again, album one and the song that we have.

63
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.270
Yeah.

64
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.770
Dynamite and this.

65
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.880
So here we have created over album and it have four songs.

66
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.900
Now we have to play this album, so we have to create a new method called.

67
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.150
BLEEP and we will pass the playlist here.

68
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:04.860
So this thing is called Playlist one, so we will pass it and we'll just to create this method and afterwards

69
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.750
we will understand.

70
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.500
So we are here what we are typing the private and the return type installs void.

71
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.860
It's static, so private static void and the name of the matter is player and it takes a linked list

72
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.000
as an input.

73
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.830
So a linked list of song obviously, and this thing is called playlist.

74
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.630
So here in this matter which will play.

75
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:41.460
So in this method we will write and understand our code and after a while and we need some kind of functionality

76
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:48.330
which involves the user interaction as well because we don't, we don't have something on that.

77
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:55.470
So we will create a couple of methods which, you know, allow us to have a user interaction.

78
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.510
So let's create.

79
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:06.840
Our first method which will try to print our menu all or on the option that we have.

80
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.900
So private static void.

81
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.480
And let's call this method the print print menu, and it wouldn't take anything.

82
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:26.270
And what we are going to do is we will simply print all our stops that we for the options we have submitted

83
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:32.420
for print all the available options down below, right down below.

84
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:40.490
And then we have the subject line thing and let's call it plus all.

85
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.820
Yeah.

86
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:48.440
Press all or press zero for the quit option.

87
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.560
So if you want to quit, so press zero.

88
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:59.810
And we are going to take all these input by the user and let's bring the line here and okay for press

89
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:06.560
one if you want to know the next song and play the next song.

90
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:13.670
So to play next one, another one next thing that we're going to have is we have to play the previous

91
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.310
previous song two for two.

92
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:28.010
It will be the previous song and we have three to replay the current song and we will press for that.

93
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:38.630
We have in the album the list of all songs and press five to print all the songs that are available.

94
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.070
And the next thing and the last thing is which we have is the sixth.

95
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.290
Delete current song.

96
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.890
So print all label options, we can print the line.

97
00:08:53.890 --> 00:09:00.130
And also the sixth one is that lead two from our album The current song.

98
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.500
Although delete current song from the playlist.

99
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.200
Sorry.

100
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:13.810
So we have the sprint menu method and the next method that we can have is let's print the list.

101
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:23.110
So let's have a different method for that private static void and it will print list and it's going

102
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:31.840
to take input as the link, the list we have to print a link list of songs and we will call it a playlist

103
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.150
because that's what we have to print.

104
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:44.540
So we need a trigger for this iterator for this and iterate throughout the song and let's call it creator

105
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:50.740
sequel equal playlist that we have passed in Not a Traitor.

106
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.910
So this is how we create a trade, right?

107
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.600
This the index for the index for the trader.

108
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.630
Let's simply print this line so we can see this line, so we can separate things.

109
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:16.400
And the next piece we have to use for loop to trade throughout the loop.

110
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.230
So while it created a has legs.

111
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.300
So that means while this thing.

112
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.150
Taz next.

113
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.140
What we have to do is we have to simply print whatever inside this list.

114
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.190
This list is so annotated.

115
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.980
Next, let's set and let's bring this line again so that it just separates everything.

116
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:49.100
So here in our both methods, we have print menu matter and then we have print less methods.

117
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.870
This print menu option will give us all the available options that we have to.

118
00:10:54.930 --> 00:11:01.710
So let's do everything inside this play method which will play over this playlist.

119
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.360
So here in this method called Play First.

120
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:15.840
This one, which we are talking the play, this method called play.

121
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:24.300
The first thing we need is a scanner because we have to be user input in the form of, you know, integers,

122
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.830
which are zero and two, three, and it's all a new scanner.

123
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.370
Here we have to parse the system dot.

124
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.330
And so here is our scanner.

125
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.450
Now let's define a couple of.

126
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.890
Boolean value.

127
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.400
So Boolean and this thing is called quit.

128
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:49.150
So it will take care that if you get has quit or non which was over zero option so boolean quit and

129
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.560
let's initially set its value false.

130
00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:00.640
And then we have boolean and this thing will be called forward and value will be the true.

131
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.950
Boolean forward equal to true.

132
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.590
And the next thing that we need is a list iterator.

133
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:18.580
So list iterator and listed editor is of the song and let's call it list.

134
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:24.010
A Twitter is equal to the play we need and what list we have to iterate.

135
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.220
So playlist list, iterator.

136
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.310
So here we have our scanner boolean and list traitor.

137
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:38.380
So the first thing that we have to do this playlist is not empty.

138
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.840
So we have to handle that case as well.

139
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:51.220
So if the play list or playlist is empty, so playlist size and this thing is, let's say, equal to

140
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:51.850
zero.

141
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:57.580
If that's the case, then we have to simply print this playlist, have no songs.

142
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.650
So this playlist have no song.

143
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.180
And in the last part, we have to print what the current song is playing.

144
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:12.310
We will print right now playing and whatever is the current position of a traitor or the listed traitor

145
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:21.610
dot next to and we have to it will return a song and it will have to convert it to string because we

146
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.240
have to print it, right.

147
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:32.020
We have to print it so we will convert it as the string so this thing will print what's the current

148
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.010
song is playing?

149
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.480
And after that, let's print the menu, print, menu.

150
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.890
And so that we have all the options available for the user.

151
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:50.590
Now since menus no visible to the user user user can either pause zero one, two, three, four and

152
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:51.760
five, six.

153
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.740
So we have to take that input.

154
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.540
So we have to check that the user has not quit, so why not quit?

155
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.900
That means while this quit is, you know, true.

156
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.420
So in that case we do.

157
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.020
So we have to take that as input.

158
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:15.310
So first, this in action is equal to a C dot net and.

159
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.920
Next end or.

160
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.760
That means you quit, as you know.

161
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.610
True.

162
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:32.010
And so I see the next end because we have to take users input.

163
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.760
And now let's break this line here.

164
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.300
