1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.660
Here.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.070
I have my project, my denim glasses, steppingstones.

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.540
Under this project, I have created two packages.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.450
One is the glass, a stepping stone, and another with the glass stepping stone.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.320
Non images which contain the images that are needed in our project for stones for projects.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.100
Second one is for food stamps, and the third one is for no stamps.

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.620
Under the glass stepping stone package, we will create our frame form and name it as a game due frame

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.300
and simply click finish here.

9
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.290
Now, under this, we will create our part.

10
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.960
Take this.

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.070
Now we need a panel here.

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.130
Simply put this.

13
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.520
After this, we need another panel.

14
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:07.540
For showing the start part will take this panel, this panel.

15
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.300
And after this, we name it as the G panel.

16
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.240
Start

17
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.300
on another panel.

18
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.150
Which we need.

19
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.060
We need a new one here and put it inside it.

20
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.820
Which contains our.

21
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.420
Being the image and text and clear it.

22
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.440
And it's done.

23
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.240
We name it as.

24
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.440
Key.

25
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.080
We will name it to the G panel.

26
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.550
No.

27
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:13.900
We have to select the label and change the variable name to clear.

28
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.350
Start here.

29
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.020
Now need another panel here.

30
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.250
Here.

31
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.850
We will do.

32
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.650
Enlarge the span.

33
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.370
Okay.

34
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.070
I'm going to sell the properties and set this color.

35
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.750
Two, three, four.

36
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.410
Come on.

37
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.340
Two, four, two.

38
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.050
One, two, four, five.

39
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.290
And none.

40
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.910
Okay.

41
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.000
We need to say this.

42
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.380
One, two, three, four.

43
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.860
Comma, two, four, two, comma, two, four, five.

44
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.730
And.

45
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.420
The children and.

46
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.820
Control LSD and this is done.

47
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.180
This panel.

48
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.950
Be sensitive to color.

49
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.190
The sun brownish and then.

50
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.350
And after this, we need another balance here.

51
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.710
And simply.

52
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.540
Here.

53
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.560
Put it aside the second year.

54
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.050
Simply skip the part.

55
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.580
We are done with this part.

56
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.520
Simply delete this.

57
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.560
We need the labels, not the panel here.

58
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.150
So.

59
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.780
And we'll do one thing.

60
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.370
Take the liberals here.

61
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.120
No.

62
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.620
We need the panel.

63
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.330
Need another panel.

64
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.620
You.

65
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.190
Another one here.

66
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.590
Third one.

67
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.930
And this will be the fourth one.

68
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.030
This will be the first time.

69
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.200
6 to 1, you know, slipped on this panel and simply press control closely.

70
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.990
And we need this here.

71
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.640
So after this, take another panel.

72
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.270
Simply copy this panel and.

73
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.750
Just grab this panel here.

74
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.530
The sun?

75
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.640
No.

76
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.760
Simply slept on this one.

77
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.040
The properties.

78
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:10.590
Simply put the corner here and we will see it to the 168, comma to zero four, comma two and five.

79
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.430
And so here the joy part is done.

80
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.470
We sized this.

81
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:47.310
Simply go to now click run select main class here.

82
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.620
So here we can see our jury part.

83
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.960
This one, we have to check for something.

84
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:13.540
Here we will go to our game theme and simply arrange the parts here.

85
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.440
This.

86
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.550
We're done with this joy party.

87
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.520
And after this, we have to go to war.

88
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.130
Function part.

89
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.970
And what you will do.

90
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.630
Here we have to firstly.

91
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:06.860
Okay.

92
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.920
We will do one thing here.

93
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.230
We have to phone.

94
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.900
We will create some functions which we are going to use.

95
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.500
So first function which we will need.

96
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:30.450
And the next thing a function to display.

97
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.650
Image and religion.

98
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.070
So for this, we need.

99
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.880
Our function, which will be as public void display.

100
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.450
Image parentheses.

101
00:09:52.780 --> 00:10:05.800
Under this we will put the parameter to string image part comma and change label.

102
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.470
To leave.

103
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.670
We had to write a body for this and.

104
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.520
Okay.

105
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:26.540
Firstly, Walter, deliver here and here what functions we are going to.

106
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.520
So another thing which we need a function

107
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.610
and.

108
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.390
Are action.

109
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:51.910
Do some function to add action to g labels when we click.

110
00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:02.810
So a function which we need here, we rename it as public void and action.

111
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:09.040
And this is a notice.

112
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.830
We will dry the body and before this instructor.

113
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:20.220
We need to create.

114
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.900
We need to create a black border first.

115
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:36.340
We have to create a black model so we will write more black.

116
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.040
Border.

117
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.070
Black powder.

118
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.060
Black powder.

119
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.010
Initialize it to.

120
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.360
Nada.

121
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:55.670
The.

122
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.110
Nurse.

123
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.210
Go after nurse.

124
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:07.110
We need to put more water factory.

125
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.300
We need a matter to which we will go.

126
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.200
Let us create,

127
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.060
create model.

128
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.130
Here we will give 100.

129
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.090
Two one.

130
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:31.580
This.

131
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.540
One, two, one, five, two, one.

132
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.030
And color we need.

133
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.310
It's a black.

134
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.640
Back after this.

135
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.460
For this.

136
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:07.090
Now we will go to the constructor and call the chip and then.

137
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.090
Jerry Brown on start.

138
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.030
Said The border.

139
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.680
Right.

140
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:25.880
Blackwater.

141
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.030
Similar to this.

142
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.180
We will try to finish.

143
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.360
Okay.

144
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.600
We have not changed.

145
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.900
We will leave.

146
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.260
We have to change the variable name also.

147
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:07.540
So here we will write cheap and finish.

148
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:19.590
We will tried to panel finish not say the border to black.

149
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.480
Now this.

150
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.460
In bold color and layout.

151
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.110
No swing water factory.

152
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.680
Okay.

153
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.840
Swing border.

154
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:39.480
Border.

155
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.300
All the imports are right.

156
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.700
So simply, we will run our file and see the output.

157
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.430
You know.

158
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:12.130
We will go to our team frame and

159
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.320
simply have to write.

160
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:29.420
Chili Bowl players start the works at the border.

161
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:41.550
And black market scene and unemployment, which we need to label change it.

162
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.020
Change variable name here and blue finish.

163
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.630
It will set you to finish.

164
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.260
Okay.

165
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.380
So after this year, we will dry.

166
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.540
Blue finish.

167
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:11.120
On the set border and give the perimeter to black border.

168
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.350
And let's stop.

169
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.840
And now we will run over five.

170
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.780
So we got our borders here.

171
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.380
Here?

172
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:31.820
No.

173
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.570
What we will do here.

174
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.520
We need to create.

175
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.790
You need to center the form also.

176
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.690
So before setting the border

177
00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.360
here, we have set the borders.

178
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.830
Before that we will enter this form to.

179
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:28.580
So we really tried to start set location related to give the parameter to know.

180
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.880
We will run our program and see.

181
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.620
So our output is coming in the center of the window here.

182
00:17:50.310 --> 00:18:00.390
So before now we have to first go to the function display image, this one, and we have to write the

183
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.730
part of this body.

184
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.350
So what we need, we have to get the image first.

185
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:16.420
Image and image icon AMG.

186
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.690
Will you tell me why?

187
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:35.420
And simply, I'd get lost here, not get the suits, shoes and get the image part.

188
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.400
And none.

189
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.600
No.

190
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.830
What we have to do another thing.

191
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.190
We have to meet.

192
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.720
We have to meet.

193
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.660
We have to make the image for drink in first syllable first.

194
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.520
So

195
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.130
here we will do.

196
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.530
We have to import this also.

197
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.530
We have to meet the image threat and

198
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.200
given global.

199
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:24.000
So we will do we will right image we need to image.

200
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:31.150
I do not get image right.

201
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.150
God scale instance.

202
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:40.310
And here we will set it to no label.

203
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.780
And give the height.

204
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:50.680
Who will take the label not get better.

205
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.790
Who knew a lot.

206
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.280
Get high.

207
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.960
I'll put this.

208
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.030
We need another thing.

209
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.490
We will not get.

210
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.340
Do we need?

211
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.150
No, we need.

212
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.510
We have to write a means not

213
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.830
to.

214
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:33.440
The ski suits and the property.

215
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.790
Slim borders.

216
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:56.450
So maybe we get this thing so right scale the scale, smooth and semicolon and after this signal side

217
00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.700
the image in the G label.

218
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:10.590
So we will write legal the set in image.

219
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:12.540
Okay.

220
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.790
Said, I got it.

221
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:22.410
We need a set icon and give the parameter to new.

222
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.980
We need the new image, Michael.

223
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.920
And we

224
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:43.690
give the parameter to the string we need to get.

225
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.320
We have to keep it.

226
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.090
Same here.

227
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.710
So let's turn.

228
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.530
No.

229
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:57.250
We will go the previous year and.

230
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.690
What we have to do.

231
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.500
Firstly, we have to change this culture to.

232
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:12.220
Yellow Sun should be mostly run this program.

233
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.140
Here.

234
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.710
Yellow.

235
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:24.400
Yellow.

236
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:34.010
Okay, we got the borders here, and now we have to get the image part to play.

237
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.290
We will write the image part.

238
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:45.430
So we will take a string name, bootstraps and equal to.

239
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.110
In water.

240
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:56.670
Our hair is in dried images.

241
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.680
Here we have name the images foodstuff.

242
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:14.760
So here we will write food stamps, not being this one semicolon similar to this.

243
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:20.970
Another thing which we need string cracks

244
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:31.660
and the thing string cracks here and the part on the.

245
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:46.890
Range and cranks not being.

246
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:58.390
And similar to that, we've tried new steps.

247
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.080
I know this feeling, right?

248
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.340
He means

249
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.690
no stops not being g.

250
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:16.260
And here we have done the part.

251
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:26.070
Now go to constructor and here we will set the images.

252
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:33.480
So firstly, we will write this split image.

253
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.150
Here we will write.

254
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.000
Food stamps.

255
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:51.210
We need the Blue Star to seem so stone simply.
