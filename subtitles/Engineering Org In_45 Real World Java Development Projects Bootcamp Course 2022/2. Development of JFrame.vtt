1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:10.590
So we will go to the file and here we will choose our new project, Java with Maven on Java application

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.750
and next year name our project emitters currency

3
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.260
converter.

4
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.640
No simply currency converter.

5
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.570
And then finish.

6
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.640
Under the source package.

7
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.110
What do we have to do here?

8
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.950
We have to create a new frame.

9
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.380
Name tags, currency converter.

10
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.790
So here we go.

11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.260
Jeffrey, under this, you will create a DUI part.

12
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.960
So.

13
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.280
Please size it.

14
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.940
The switch.

15
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.130
No

16
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.490
report here.

17
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.900
They took the property

18
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.640
and we will take a border.

19
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.490
That should be the line to us will be the three more rounded corners.

20
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.900
Turn the corner

21
00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.830
and click.

22
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.430
Okay.

23
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.040
And you've got the border.

24
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.090
This is done.

25
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.280
No data label.

26
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.410
In order to free.

27
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.510
An.

28
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.860
As the currency converter.

29
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.420
The sun.

30
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.260
No, we have to change.

31
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.220
Due to the properties.

32
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.990
Foreign ground.

33
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.010
Should we

34
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.190
have to change also?

35
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:55.490
So, Gloria, make it bold, make it routine.

36
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.480
So to.

37
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.130
Here is what he said.

38
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.150
No, no, no.

39
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.410
To lose or is.

40
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.960
Oh.

41
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.550
Slightly chilly, but here we have to change the font.

42
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.060
I think I changed the final form, so let's just fix it.

43
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.700
And here, go to the.

44
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.700
We?

45
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.840
We need a common sense search warrant and into the foreground to this color

46
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.610
background should be the right clues.

47
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.680
In the middle.

48
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.370
So.

49
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.800
So what should we do?

50
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.290
So I ordered the stunt.

51
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.680
And now another thing which we have to do.

52
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:07.060
The input from the user and choose the country, the first country and the second country.

53
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:15.400
We have to select from the user and take some inputs here so we can take some components here.

54
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.190
What should we do?

55
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:29.680
We can we can take the combo box here, this one here, and another combo box here.

56
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.910
This was so.

57
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.300
We have to resize it.

58
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.270
This one.

59
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.460
Currently.

60
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.310
So

61
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.580
this one third, this one said.

62
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.490
No bigger text box here.

63
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.200
This text from earlier

64
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.280
this year.

65
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.770
Resize this.

66
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.460
Copyright.

67
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:58.150
Just one not equally for the from country to country thing so they can live there

68
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.880
this year.

69
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.440
And we have to take it to levels also.

70
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.560
So the currency here.

71
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.520
And here.

72
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.000
We will do that later.

73
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:35.800
And now we need another three buttons for the currency converter and another button should be for the

74
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.720
reset button and another button for the exit.

75
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.320
Okay, so here's what we will do.

76
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.720
Firstly, we should

77
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.620
just terminate.

78
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.140
Firstly we have to set the font.

79
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.300
So select all this, list this to select all.

80
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.690
To the properties.

81
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.820
They formed.

82
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:30.000
Ball and a team that are more close.

83
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.790
To be less.

84
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.800
14.

85
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.210
Okay.

86
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:49.620
Don't.

87
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:01.820
No.

88
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.040
No.

89
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.430
I did text and write

90
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.540
some currency.

91
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.360
From currency of

92
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:30.150
text and write to currency off.

93
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:39.340
So this size, this size, this to

94
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.920
clear the text field, square the text field.

95
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.240
And then this return edit text and set it.

96
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.700
Convert.

97
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.660
I'm here.

98
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.480
Text and write.

99
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.940
Reset and text and write.

100
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.500
Exit.

101
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.590
And in this we have to write some units.

102
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.080
32 units.

103
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.170
It won't change according to the currencies.

104
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.380
So firstly, we have to align these things.

105
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.900
Properties here.

106
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.850
So to that aroma, the previous one.

107
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:27.180
Simply use this one knows and it's done

108
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.130
here.

109
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.420
We have to select some.

110
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.890
And we're doing a horizontal alignment and.

111
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:46.730
Okay.

112
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.150
Right here.

113
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.740
Go to your right.

114
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.470
Okay.

115
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.420
Simply run this file.

116
00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.370
Select main class.

117
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:09.680
Here.

118
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:15.680
You can see with your iPad, which we have created, simply looking nice and sober.

119
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:24.770
So now we have to set these functions and simply this has to change according to the from currency to

120
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.740
currency of these things, the unit thing.

121
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.780
So what we will do now?

122
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.600
Firstly, we have to change these items first.

123
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.660
So we will do one thing

124
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.430
year properties

125
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.030
here, go to the model property and here we can see the list.

126
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.900
So we can do one thing.

127
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.720
We can write about things.

128
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.030
So we will write, choose one.

129
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:12.310
And after this, we will write the U.S. and Nigeria.

130
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:19.800
Brazil, Canada, Ghanaian.

131
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.370
Non-issue.

132
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.020
India.

133
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:38.580
Sagittal flipping and the next one is Pakistani.

134
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.880
Just copy this

135
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.100
study to.

136
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.900
Okay.

137
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.410
And close?

138
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.070
No.

139
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.380
You can see here our list here.

140
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.870
This one.

141
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.760
Who's.

142
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.820
This is great.

143
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.890
So everything is good.

144
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:09.940
Now we have to change.

145
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.370
This one comma works.

146
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:17.620
So, like this property, go to the model.

147
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.050
Now we have to change this.

148
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.440
Good to know.

149
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:37.170
Here we have to write the currency's name or just simply make it seem so loose and simply run this way.

150
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.080
Oh, no, I can see her.

151
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.060
Every issue in which we have settled this one.

152
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:51.720
Right.

153
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.760
And this exchange.

154
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.500
But now what do we have to do?

155
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:09.180
If we select the you select the you will say this unit thing, which is also g should also be changed.

156
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.810
So what should we do if we change here?

157
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.050
It should also change by the user.

158
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.280
So the next.
