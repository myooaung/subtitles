WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.850
So we already created some part of our application.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.250
So I created this generation of key using a servo with secret key initializing the vector for any value

3
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.550
with randomizing thing and ciphertext.

4
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.260
So we

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.770
block of cipher text, which is basically salt or salt.

6
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.620
So now I required IV parameter also.

7
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.150
We pay them to speak.

8
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.500
So this is very.

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.030
I need better.

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
Stick with me mentioned like this is equal to new.

11
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.850
How have you been able to speak with what initially?

12
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.810
Michelle.

13
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.690
So this is the parameters.

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.780
Specs.

15
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.430
That speaks of Cipher.

16
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.940
Look.

17
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.910
A lot of aspects.

18
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.990
Parameter aspects of Safe Rock.

19
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.160
So now I need to initialize my cipher.

20
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.570
So would.

21
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.890
It.

22
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.530
Safer.

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.360
Look, I need to initialize my private block with need.

24
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.330
With what?

25
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.050
Cipher.

26
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.820
Safer.

27
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.500
Dot.

28
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.360
I need to mention the mode also encrypt mode.

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.050
Between trip mode.

30
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.520
I need to mention not only the war but with the security.

31
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.220
Also, I need to specify the security.

32
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.240
Also that security already created in the parameter.

33
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.970
With respect, I need parameters.

34
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.580
What is going to return me?

35
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.900
It should return me the ciphertext to the return cipher not do.

36
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.320
Finally.

37
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.570
There is one method in cipher.

38
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.000
plainText, not gigabytes.

39
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.690
So if you are not mentioning this, it's okay.

40
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.230
No need to mention the standard character sets and everything.

41
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.300
So now we are done with Cipher.

42
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.700
So what we created, we created method to create secret key with a random thing.

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.120
Again using the initial vector as a random thing because we are putting message, but it's going to

44
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.150
use secure random method to initialize that trend.

45
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:07.080
Choosing that vector part randomizing things then for do a is encryption and creating plaintext to ciphertext

46
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.790
with the key.

47
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.570
I'm going to mention this.

48
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.720
Now what I going to mention perform the reverse operation cipher two plaintext.

49
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.030
So method two.

50
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.260
I foot.

51
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.550
Plain text.

52
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.680
Cipher text.

53
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.960
Plain text.

54
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.520
So I already mentioned here is about.

55
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.530
So politics and everything.

56
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.160
So public static.

57
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.630
Now it should be strange.

58
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.470
Not always, but I don't want to do it.

59
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.360
Bye bye.

60
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.740
Bye bye.

61
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.190
So do a decryption.

62
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.840
As encryption abilities decryption to perform.

63
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.070
With some default parameters I'm going to mention here.

64
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.790
First is bite size politics.

65
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.290
So put it.

66
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.450
Impossible to predict ciphertext.

67
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.250
Secondly, secret key.

68
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.040
So because security is always you meaning same security.

69
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.940
She?

70
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.350
So it's not going to.

71
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.160
Take.

72
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.510
She got it right here this morning.

73
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.360
Security.

74
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.170
And I need to initialize that with the roads because it's not.

75
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.590
As a general.

76
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.680
Yes, we should return.

77
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.240
That's done with truth.

78
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.030
Exceptional as it should to exception.

79
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.880
One exception with.

80
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.840
So now we are done.

81
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.290
So let me do one thing.

82
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.350
So using your ciphertext as one initial vector to store and return as.

83
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.110
So let us see how we are going to do.

84
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.900
Again, ask for cipher.

85
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.100
Small ciphers.

86
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.330
Cipher is called cipher.

87
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.970
Not yet instance of which a.

88
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.620
See a psychologist.

89
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.520
Then I need to mention the parameter.

90
00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.100
This parameter switched again simply because this is not changing text.

91
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.550
Now I need to initialize in the decrypt mode.

92
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.360
So the.

93
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.720
Keep.

94
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.180
No.

95
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.600
I need to initialize so I don't need to initialize it.

96
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:23.540
With cipher dot decrypt mode decrypt mode is going to decrypt me with twitch security.

97
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.130
The security is going to use it, which I've parameter space.

98
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.220
So he's going to choose this and what he's going to do is it's going to me.

99
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.030
Mention as Bite

100
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.220
Weasel is going to give me the bite lizard.

101
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.560
Cipher not cipher list.

102
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.700
Only cipher.

103
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.230
Do.

104
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.290
Finally, it's going to bring fighting here with separatist.

105
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.850
Separatist.

106
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.980
It's going to give them finality and it's going to return me.

107
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.430
And create new.

108
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.140
During.

109
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.380
Result has changed.

110
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.170
So it will print me in the string as my result.

111
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.370
So now what I need to mention, I need to create driver code here.

112
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.200
So let me create.

113
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.610
But I will.

114
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.910
The stream.

115
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.230
Public static always.

116
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.290
Again, it should close the exception.

117
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.560
Exception with which security notes.

118
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.180
Secret.

119
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.830
Random keys.

120
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.550
Secret key.

121
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.200
Security with security.

122
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.310
Let me mention security.

123
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.290
Key security.

124
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.850
You can create security with symmetric key also.

125
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:07.990
No problem.

126
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.310
Wait a minute.

127
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.600
You mentioned mention security asymmetrically.

128
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.140
Because it's symmetric always.

129
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.640
Semitic.

130
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.220
We'd create a scheme.

131
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.540
So it will create me.

132
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.720
I will mention this escape.

133
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:36.650
Okay.

134
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.430
Short form is good for this skill.

135
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.130
Then.

136
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.380
16 dot.

137
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.960
Oh, but in.

138
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.660
The Simi three.

139
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.010
It's going to the summer.

140
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.250
The key for me again, it's simple.

141
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.610
Or is going to do here.

142
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.860
I need to mention this only inside.

143
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.890
So let me copy this again and please name.

144
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.760
So that's what I'm going to print.

145
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.190
Okay.

146
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.980
So it will print the symmetric key.

147
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.800
Before that, let me mention 116

148
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.690
.8.3.

149
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.040
Don't start.

150
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.070
Don't start.

151
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.940
Keep.

152
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.170
More.

153
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.390
If we do this and more, then what is going to perform.

154
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.360
I am printing this, but I need to initialize one vector also because I.

155
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.110
I'm not storing it.

156
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:08.360
Right.

157
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:08.800
So.

158
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.910
Michelle.

159
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.540
Richter.

160
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.760
I'm going to mention it.

161
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:26.420
Now I need this method, which is basically create initial vector, so

162
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.260
create initial vector.

163
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.720
So it will give me the vector also.

164
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:32.990
So.

165
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.710
So what you can do and you can use scanner method to perform this.

166
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.730
And you can use different methods to perform this also.

167
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.830
So let me use these methods.

168
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:09.750
So I will copy some code part directly due to time concern because this is very simple code.

169
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.910
I will explain you how it's going to work.

170
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.780
The city.

171
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:15.580
Useful.

172
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.840
So going.

173
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.000
Escape.

174
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.340
We shared with them.

175
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.670
And then again.

176
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.940
It's.

177
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.610
Share your.

178
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.420
And look.

179
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.110
So this is for publicity, publicity, employment.

180
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:03.910
So.

181
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.610
What it's doing.

182
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:26.470
It's doing the encryption with plaintext as my security key, and it's going to initiate this.

183
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.850
Ciphertext, encrypted messages.

184
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.260
You can look like this.

185
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.250
Okay.

186
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.800
With encryption.

187
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.870
Who's going to decrypt this message?

188
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:53.510
Okay.

189
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.680
So now we are done with this.

190
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.290
And let me think.

191
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.360
Your system brought out a lot.

192
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:07.760
Think.

193
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.780
Now this is decrypted.

194
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.860
So let me mention this also.

195
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.820
Decrypt more.

196
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:34.020
So now let us run this and let us check whether we are correct with our things or not.

197
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.660
So apparently you can check.

198
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.070
It's building and we.

199
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.350
So we.

200
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:59.990
I want to mention this.

201
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.900
It's not.

202
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:02.650
Required.

203
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.230
So let me check it again.

204
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.620
What is this text, which is basically.

205
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.160
So me do it again.

206
00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.090
So sometimes if there is one error, it might go to the error.

207
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.950
But now you can check here.

208
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.520
Symmetric key is this for our message.

209
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:11.460
And ciphertext is using this encrypted this message and you got the original message.

210
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.620
So this is it.

211
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.310
It's doing.

212
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:23.220
But let me go to further more advanced thing, which is I'm going to create you already created.

213
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:29.880
This message scan the message I haven't used so message.

214
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.130
Next line.

215
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.530
I'm.

216
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:46.880
System not bought into them.

217
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.660
And the message I am asking for message.

218
00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.940
And let me mention one thing here.

219
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:08.180
Instead of creating, as you describe it, let me do one thing.

220
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:21.110
Still no message is equal to new standard because it's not going to take input standard.

221
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:46.240
Another party system don't help Clinton selection for.

222
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.080
Giving better look soonish.

223
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.870
Okay, now let us run this again.

224
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.670
So this time we already your original messages.

225
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.680
This is a message you want to include.

226
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.170
So now what I'm going to do?

227
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.590
I'm going to print name from user.

228
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.960
And this is my symmetric key.

229
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.650
So it will ask me for a reason.

230
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:19.750
Or you can check or encrypt more symmetric keys already generated enter message.

231
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.380
Hello world I'm going to bring you can check your messages anyway.

232
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:32.980
So this is my encrypted message and in the equipment decryption mode it's going to decrypt this message.

233
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.400
It's not like I am mentioning here.

234
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.280
You can check in another decrypt mode.

235
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.840
You can use this and you can run another client for decryption also.

236
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.190
So that's how we can use symmetric in encryption.

237
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.570
So let me check.

238
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:54.520
This is Java program.

239
00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.740
I am order.

240
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.190
You can do it.

241
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.150
So within a second.

242
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:08.050
So let's set about how we can create symmetric encryption and everything using Java.

243
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.130
Hope you understand.

244
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:09.910
Thank you.
