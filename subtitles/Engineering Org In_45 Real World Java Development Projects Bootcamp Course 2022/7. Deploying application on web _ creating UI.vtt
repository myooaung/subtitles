1
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.740
In previous part, I told you how I created each an extra controller.

2
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.630
But let me.

3
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.030
With some more advanced ten year.

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.200
So let me.

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.890
Do one thing here.

6
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.500
So as you know, this is all the controlling part.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.260
I will do it or I will.

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.400
I'm going with that part.

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.660
But let us check whether our application is running or not.

10
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.210
First, because I'm curious about that, whether it is running or not.

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.870
So.

12
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.130
Public.

13
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.400
I already created that method.

14
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.640
A blistering home.

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.920
Which is going to return.

16
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.490
Mia.

17
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.330
What is the home?

18
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.240
So home is I'm going to create inside the template.

19
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.130
So home is nothing but the thing.

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.120
Which is why I'm going to create.

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.920
So this is all about I'm going to create.

22
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.840
So what I did is I just created this part and now what I'm going to do, I'm going to deploy it on the

23
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.380
web.

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.040
So if you have seen this is the microphone tab and I'm going to mention the URL first, but before that,

25
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.570
remember what I'm going to do.

26
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.220
I'm going to check application.

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.970
This is not very important step, but checking application is very important.

28
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.070
First, whether it's running or not for that purpose, I'm going to use this.

29
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.270
So.

30
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.150
Let me check whether it is running or not.

31
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.820
So.

32
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.770
Inside the template, go to template part.

33
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.970
Click, right click.

34
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.470
You can click new and file.

35
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.810
You can use the html directly file, but html home dot html.

36
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.200
But it will create one file for me.

37
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.320
And this is it.

38
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.450
Let me mention each one slash.

39
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.860
Which one?

40
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.280
Hello.

41
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.100
Would.

42
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.070
So this is it.

43
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.170
Let me run my application.

44
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.560
So these currently running but what you can do.

45
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.560
You can go to your local host city.

46
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.390
You can check that part.

47
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.270
So once you started running.

48
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.720
But.

49
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.780
A really successful software application is running now.

50
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.110
So let me move to my.

51
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.480
Lost.

52
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.010
And if we done this.

53
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.460
So this is basically the it's shrink data because explicit sleep mapping is showing here and why that's

54
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.780
in the home controller.

55
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.690
I mentioned this explicit mapping.

56
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.040
So what are you going to do to white label error?

57
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.790
You can do.

58
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.640
Or you can check.

59
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.790
On.

60
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.010
News fallback or not.

61
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.960
If it's fallback, you can do one thing.

62
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.830
You can check your XML, whether it's working or not.

63
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.550
So.

64
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.130
If it's working.

65
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.510
Let me do one thing because.

66
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.270
I haven't mentioned this earlier.

67
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.100
This is.

68
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.610
Let me tell you why it is showing why.

69
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.340
Because I haven't mentioned this controller gate mapping part.

70
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.430
So it is very important because it's not mapping at all.

71
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.560
So let me run this again.

72
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.760
And now you should understand why it is showing me the error because this is the home dot html.

73
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.130
Yeah, I mentioned go to this.

74
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.010
But what is the gate mapping method?

75
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.840
It should be mapped there.

76
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.760
So let me run it again.

77
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.540
Local host.

78
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.490
And let me go to the Chrome tab.

79
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.760
Now you can see the Helloworld is now printing.

80
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.000
So basic thing is that I mentioned this localhost again, etc..

81
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.860
That's okay.

82
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.620
But inside the ID iPad gate mapping controller is very important.

83
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.530
And this is the basic the injection part of our data.

84
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.570
So let me remove this.

85
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.910
Now, you should understand.

86
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Or you can understand what localhost is running.

87
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.380
Let me go with this.

88
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.760
Our four previous part here.

89
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.520
Which is basically underwired.

90
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.220
Then the gate mapping method.

91
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.890
Then this list which contains all the things.

92
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.680
These things which contains all the things.

93
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.640
Well, currently, let me stop this part.

94
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.720
So no, our application is not running.

95
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.870
But the thing is, we haven't mentioned any further part here.

96
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.730
Now we are remaining with some things here which is basically integer better.

97
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.690
So let me create one in total reported cases here.

98
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.260
So in.

99
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.920
Total.

100
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.020
Deported.

101
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.930
Is equal to what I'm going to do.

102
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.930
I'm going to put inside the.

103
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.290
All stats.

104
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.690
Basically all stats dot.

105
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.840
What I can do.

106
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.510
I can stream this part.

107
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.100
Stream this part inside the location part steam dot.

108
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.660
Map and why I'm using this map to it.

109
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.760
So basically, I'm going to map to.

110
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.280
You basically start.

111
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.780
Wiggins is that sort of the thing that they used?

112
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.140
State only notes that.

113
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.200
This is the mapping.

114
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.020
And let me just use this.

115
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.720
Well, it is going to print me the everything here.

116
00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.880
Okay.

117
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.640
Okay.

118
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.610
So it will bring me this current live here and return our stream.

119
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.110
So I need to return the string.

120
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.240
Also later the home part.

121
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.320
But now I'm going with this only.

122
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.570
Similarly, I'm going to create this.

123
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.700
Basically.

124
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.950
And total new cases.

125
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.390
Now I need to create model.

126
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.420
I'd attribute if you know the spring party, you need to add the attributes here first.

127
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.540
So adding the attribute is basically location stats.

128
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.360
Location.

129
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.920
That's.

130
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.280
Or.

131
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.360
All states.

132
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.640
Let me check whether.

133
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.720
Like giving it a.

134
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.340
Do I mention this part down to?

135
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.550
Mutandis my own.

136
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.040
Similarly.

137
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.370
I need to mention this.

138
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.450
And.

139
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.250
But, no, not at the.

140
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.210
Attribute.

141
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.430
So the thing is, I'm going to return.

142
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.990
So what is going it is going to create is.

143
00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.210
You know this home.

144
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.660
It is going to.

145
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.730
All that in the home part or I'm going to map that to the home part.

146
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:13.270
So coronavirus data service, it is going to face the data from our URL.

147
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.650
This is our URL.

148
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.350
Then location starts is going to.

149
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.220
Again the all data basically these all the data from.

150
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.970
This and it's basically model thing.

151
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.240
So it is going to check my everything here first.

152
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.220
So this is all about how I'm going to create but.

153
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.250
The thing is.

154
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:49.610
Very important here as I created this model, part of what it specifies, search said get search is

155
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:54.970
going to use here, but it's going to set that state each and everything.

156
00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:00.320
So let me use the home part first to basically helloworld.

157
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:08.990
And if you want to use, you can use directly the template part or if you want to change your template,

158
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:15.980
you can change your template also so you can use any bootstrap program or anything.

159
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:21.380
But as I told you, I'm going to mention this directly from the web.

160
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.400
I will tell you what is the basic thing here?

161
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.010
So these are the tables.

162
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.840
I'm going to use this and it's a total reported cases, total new cases.

163
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.100
It's going to use years which span each extra.

164
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.340
So.

165
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.120
Or this is all about how I mentioned this.

166
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.270
So it contains some controlling Java part.

167
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.500
This is the controller for the running with the location statistics and these are the all the things.

168
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.960
So let me mention this first.

169
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:59.600
So these are some themes if I'm going to use with stylesheet with the container and.

170
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.870
Let me change this.

171
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.660
Earlier I mentioned this as COVID 19.

172
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:06.990
So.

173
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.460
Let me display this new.

174
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.220
Cases reported since previous day.

175
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.670
With total cases with the table.

176
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.030
And this is the changes since last day.

177
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.380
Each and every thing you can get sit country.

178
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.100
Each and everything.

179
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.080
State and country.

180
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.410
Location strategies.

181
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.400
All the from the our data complete.

182
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.110
And I'm going to use the.

183
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:42.330
So if you know there's some spitting you can use this if not you can zero here and table so it's just

184
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.380
a tabular format.

185
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.260
The home controller.

186
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.240
I'm mentioning the home controlling part.

187
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.820
And you can check your also if it's working or not, you can check it from here.

188
00:11:54.550 --> 00:12:01.720
Controller is just controlling each and everything here and coronavirus data allow let me run this again

189
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.840
and it is going to first build the project.

190
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.930
After that, it will run throughout this project.

191
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.270
If there is an error, you can check your CSV file first, whether it's running or not.

192
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.470
So currently.

193
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.800
My data is running.

194
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.260
No spring work is running now.

195
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:22.490
Tomcat.

196
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.900
Tom Server is running.

197
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.000
Let me reload this.

198
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.810
So sometimes there may be some errors in data.

199
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.970
Although sometimes there is.

200
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.900
There is not an error in data.

201
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.590
So.

202
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.180
Why?

203
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.960
Sometimes you're showing me the error.

204
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.720
Because the row is empty.

205
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.480
So let me go to the chrome application.

206
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.990
So as you can see, this is my final wave.

207
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.060
It's looking so.

208
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.710
In different states like New South Wales.

209
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.660
In Australia, total cases reported and changes since last is zero.

210
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.070
But sometimes in these you can check.

211
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.480
So these are my new total cases reported previously.

212
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.890
These are the listings.

213
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.130
So this is all I'm getting.

214
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.800
Some of it I'm getting from this.

215
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.030
You are.

216
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.380
Or you can see this.

217
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:26.870
So I change it to the you are forced to get the embedded thing.

218
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.260
Then I created a HTTP response to get response.

219
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.890
And I created a client sign to send that request.

220
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.430
Then using for each loop, I'm going to invoke this.

221
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.710
Then of doing this all the stocks.

222
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.040
What I'm doing here.

223
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.340
I'm creating here location stats with model team.

224
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.280
While developing this.

225
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.460
There is one tricky state you can say.

226
00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.730
I need to mention that or list at least you can use it.

227
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.480
I'm mentioning as list here.

228
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.750
Then I created one for each loop to invoke throughout this process.

229
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.120
And it's going to bring me down.

230
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.470
If you want to do one thing, you can change the star.

231
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:16.980
This one.

232
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.860
So what will happen?

233
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.030
Let me show you.

234
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.560
You can run this again.

235
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.010
And it will started running.

236
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.900
So it will be printed this.

237
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.150
And it will start running in each and every 1 seconds.

238
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.250
So it will be updated each and every 1 seconds.

239
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.020
So let me run this again.

240
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.420
You can check your updating again.

241
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.280
Total cases, new cases.

242
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.730
These are the state, country and each and everything.

243
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.400
So some are not in state.

244
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.950
So like Brazil, it's not showing any state because it's the whole country.

245
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.180
So these are the cases and all the things it's showing.

246
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:10.120
So if you have seen the present data there, you can check.

247
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:15.460
It's not very useful because there are no what we can say.

248
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.430
Such differences in CSV file.

249
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:24.760
So what I'm doing, I created one web application to check each and everything, so now it's very useful

250
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.020
to check.

251
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.660
Is there any thing inside this?

252
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:34.340
But unfortunately in that data, there is no Indian method or we can say not indicating.

253
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:40.130
If you want to check for India, you can check and you can use similar logic here.

254
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.020
Just you need to change the UI and you're good to go with this part.

255
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.320
So this is all about how we created everything.

256
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.380
Go to the Chrome tab first.

257
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.210
So this is our application, as I told you.

258
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.310
So this is the state and this is all it's taking from the URL.

259
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.930
I'm not printing anything here.

260
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.700
This is taking from the URL.

261
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.950
This is the Australia.

262
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.920
These are the cases.

263
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.270
And these are the cases.

264
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.450
So why it's putting the zero?

265
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.020
Because it is not updated there.

266
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.680
If you want to check any update thing, you can check that.

267
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:19.820
So in the ID, you just need to require to create three things coronavirus data service to create service

268
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:25.490
in spring application location stats to create modeling home controller to controlling each and every

269
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.520
part home dot HTML.

270
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.430
Now home control is just controlling the part.

271
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.420
As in the servlet.

272
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.150
There are XML for the mappings.

273
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.340
We removed this XML in the spring and we created one controller to print this model here.

274
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.310
As you can see, and I'm printing this return home.

275
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.200
If I change it in return home, you can check that changes in that part also.

276
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.930
As you can see, I created this coronavirus.

277
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.770
I can mention as COVID 19.

278
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.370
This.

279
00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.040
Let me.

280
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.460
So this if I.

281
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:05.980
Do this.

282
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.260
You can check here also.

283
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.090
So let me rerun this again.

284
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:10.080
Stop and rerun.

285
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.030
So it will be the parallel running.

286
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.780
So this is all the boat I created.

287
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.070
You can check here.

288
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:17.940
This is running.

289
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:24.360
So this is very useful in while creating such applications, which is basically real time applications.

290
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.640
Let me go to the Chrome tab again.

291
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.660
Let me rerun this again, local or state.

292
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.120
Now you can see these things.

293
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.300
So it is not displaying this.

294
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.200
If you want to check.

295
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.060
You can check it.

296
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.780
Another thing.

297
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.220
So that's how we created our application.

298
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.270
Hope you understand.

299
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.840
You can extend it to further more like in the HTML for the UI purpose.

300
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.760
What you can do.

301
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.190
You can mention some search methods also.

302
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.170
I just put the simple UI here, but you can check that part also here.

303
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:06.260
Now you can move further with some useful things like COVID bed stats.

304
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.600
Also, if hospital beds, you can check for that purpose.

305
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.510
You can create log in, log out methods for that also.

306
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.190
So this is the simple application I created, but you can extend it further more.

307
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:23.670
Now, while developing this, there are two simple steps never change this coronavirus data.

308
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.010
So these are the default things.

309
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.190
No need to change because it will apply this.

310
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.490
Then create default or what.

311
00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:38.610
We can see some specified names, packages to display all the things.

312
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:44.170
So this is it about how we created our data visualization application using spring.

313
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.950
So this is it all about COVID 19 tracker application.

314
00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.300
Hope you understand.

315
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.350
Thank you.
