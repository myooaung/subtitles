1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,110
So this is the class fee structure or Java which is defined inside the package university and we have

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,960
imported the necessary packages Java to export swing and Java JWT.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,210
Then we have defined the class fee structure extending frame.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,010
After that, we have.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,170
Besides the labels here, 17 labels and Ally.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,090
There is another label and we have defined another many labels here.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,690
We have defined for the two store the it will show a table table a representation of the structure of

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,760
the piece for multiple courses and semesters.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,450
So and now inside the public fee structure that is a non parameterized constructor, we have set the

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,690
size for the window, location of the window and layout of the window.

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,390
Now there is a label which will show fee structure setting font for it, bound off it.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,670
Then there is a label course setting bound for it, font for it and adding the label.

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,990
After that, there's a label and two which is showing for the Beat Font Pounder, everything for it.

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,340
And there's a label, VCA bound for it, font for it, and adding it to that.

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,200
But then there's another label for the course VBA.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:25,920
Then there is a fees for the courses 25,000, 25,000, 25,000, 25,000 for the semesters.

17
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,890
And similarly then there is another course b.sc.

18
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,160
That will be of three years.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,970
So this will be the average semester fees of the course.

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,510
P.S. 18,000, 18,000, 13,000, 18,000.

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,340
And then there is an MBA course label label for the MBA.

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,230
Then fees of the NBA that will be off for years.

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:58,450
So there are four semesters sorry MBAs of two years and for the it will have four semesters and.

24
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,710
So there are for 65,000 labels.

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,130
Then we have another label for the MSI, which will be.

26
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,390
Here for themselves.

27
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,470
55,000.

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,460
Then we have for the fees for them.

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,480
81,000.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,170
81,000.

31
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,100
81,000.

32
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,760
Then we have labels for the semester here.

33
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,710
Level four semester.

34
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,350
One, two, three, four, five.

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,130
Six, seven, eight maximum semesters can be of hate that will be in b.tech and.

36
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,300
For the other courses.

37
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,070
We will not show the face of that.

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,730
Those semesters now be when we will be selecting a phase 43,000, 43,004.

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,290
That will be for the b.tech.

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,260
Yes, that will be for the B.tech.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,420
There are eight labels for that, 43,000 fees.

42
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,620
Then there is 32,000 fees for the labels.

43
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,670
After that, there is a.

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,430
Background color of windows is white and the visibility is true.

45
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,580
Then there's the static Weidman method for which we have setting the fee structure visibility as true.

46
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,950
After that, let's have a look on a student fee formed on Java.

47
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,570
Imported the necessary package.

48
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,490
Sorry, it is defined inside the package.

49
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:33,900
University importing the necessary package JWT Swing Border, AWG dot event Java, Autodesk and Java

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,650
dot util.

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Then the student fee form we have extending frame and implementing extend listener.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,460
Then we have private panel content pane.

53
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,870
Private text field.

54
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,550
The one and the two, three, three.

55
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:51,710
Then we have private combo box four, combo box two buttons and one choice.

56
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,110
Then there's the public static Weidman string.

57
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,320
This new strain free form set visible as two.

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,680
Public student fee form.

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,130
Let's.

60
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,470
Head headed as student fee form, then setting the bond.

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,390
For that window and setting the new panel water for the panel, adding it to the frame, setting the

62
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,410
layout as null.

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,110
And then there is a new choice.

64
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,930
Foreground color.

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,100
Using the rugby and there is setting the font for it inside the trip log.

66
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,710
This will establish connection with our database allows you to select extract from a student and while

67
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,650
iterating over the record of that student table.

68
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,450
It will add role numbers in our the choice so that we can select choice whenever we want to fill the

69
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,190
form fees form.

70
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,050
After that cash block will handle exception.

71
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,710
Then there is a label 11 select roll number which will be used to select roll number, setting the foreground

72
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,260
font and bounds for it, adding that to our frame after that label and to name setting foreground color

73
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,520
font bound for it.

74
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,050
Adding a third panel.

75
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,180
Similarly for the label l three that is Father's name setting for one colour font bound and adding it

76
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,020
to the frame.

77
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:17,400
Similarly for the branch as well, setting foreground colour, background colour, font of it.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,140
Bound of it and adding it to the.

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,870
Panel.

80
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:27,080
Then we have a level five semester for which the fees will be submitted for one color font for it,

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,510
bound for it, and adding it to the panel.

82
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,330
Then there's the label six, which is a total payable for one color for eight font for it, bound for

83
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,890
it, and adding the content pane.

84
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,430
That is a label.

85
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,350
Then setting the bond for it.

86
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,400
Bond for the choice, adding the choice to our panel.

87
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,940
Then there is a new text field for one setting, for one color for it, font for it, column bound and

88
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,210
lining it to the panel.

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,340
Another text field setting for one color for red font for it, column for it setting.

90
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,910
Bound for that table and adding that.

91
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,880
Next to our panel.

92
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,250
Inside that blog, we have initialized the connection and executed the query that is select as from

93
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,980
a student where rule number will be the selected item from the choice.

94
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:22,510
This will trade over the record of the students where rule number will match and store the name and

95
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,620
fathers name of the student in the 23 text field respectively.

96
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,050
Then there is a combo box to select from the branch.

97
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:42,340
And whose foreground color font bound and have been added here now combo box two which will be used

98
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,510
to select.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,680
This will be used to select semesters.

100
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,230
So this will be used to select semesters.

101
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,510
New font.

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,460
We have set the font type.

103
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:04,330
Size and family of this combo box text, then foreground color bound for the combo box.

104
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,230
And I think it to that our panel, then we have a new text field setting foreground color for it.

105
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,220
Font for it.

106
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,800
Columns for it and bounce for it.

107
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,690
Adding to that our frame as well.

108
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,150
Then there is a button.

109
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,070
Be excellent listener to the button, setting the font for it, bound for it, background color for

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,460
color and adding to adding that to panel.

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,490
After that, there is another button B to adding action listener to it, setting font font for it,

112
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:43,910
and setting the bound for that button, adding background color for regular and adding it to our panel.

113
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:51,280
After that there is another label as labeled cause setting back for rental for it using RDB values,

114
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,750
then setting font for it.

115
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,400
Bound for it and ending the.

116
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,470
Label to our panel.

117
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:07,140
Then there is a combo box to select from the course, which is from bootcamp taken by BBC, ABC and

118
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,650
a foreground colour for it.

119
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,030
Combo box for the font.

120
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,370
Bound for it and adding it to that, our panel.

121
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:26,130
Another panel whose setting its border named as free form and background color for it, using R&amp;B values

122
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,450
and bound for the.

123
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,350
Panel.

124
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,420
Then we have set the background color of the complete panel and the.

125
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,350
Panel and they will edit the panel to our panel.

126
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,860
I did this panel, which is showing the border to a world.

127
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,210
Panel.

128
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,750
After that, we have defined here the action performed method which is taking argument as action event.

129
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,900
Try if a dot get sources equals to from.

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,980
Even if the button event of the button is from one, then we will stabilize the connection with our

131
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,970
database and create the query select insert into fees.

132
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,990
So this will insert into the fees table the required values.

133
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,720
These are the values that is a prepared statement.

134
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,010
Pass the prepared statement.

135
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,270
Execute that prepared statement.

136
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,160
And we will.

137
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,220
Be fetching these.

138
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,520
Executing that prepared statement by suggesting first or get selected item and with respect to text

139
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,850
fill and selected item from the combo box and the choices we will update our in our database table that

140
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,920
is fee so entire is equals to start execute update so for I is greater than zero.

141
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,460
We will show successfully updated, so I will hold the associated execute update.

142
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,020
So if the statement executed successfully, it will restore one which will be greater than zero.

143
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,510
So it will so successfully paid.

144
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,690
If does not update it successfully, then it will be less than zero.

145
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,530
That will be minus one.

146
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:00,980
So.

147
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:08,630
It will go to else option and it also the error cache block will handle any exception if occurs and

148
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,610
if the source is from B2, then we will set the visibility of the current window as false and catch

149
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,190
any expression in the catch block.

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
So this is about all the.

151
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,050
This is about the class's fee structure and student fee form.

152
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,600
And this.

153
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:33,620
Now this will complete all the introduction explanation of the Java classes in our next video.

154
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,850
We will be having a look in the at the library of this project, which will help us to understand the

155
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:46,180
relativity and relativity of these classes database that how they are working.

156
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,120
The data has been updated or in database or not.

157
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,100
Data is fetching from the database correctly or not, so that those all things will be understanding

158
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,260
in our next video, which will be on the library of this project that is university management system.

159
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,180
So for till now, let me show you the output of these two classes.

160
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,790
I will be running from the login.

161
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,880
I'll run the login class.

162
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,090
I'll be writing admin.

163
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,440
Kellerman.

164
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,630
Then we click on log in.

165
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,640
Now.

166
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,660
We have fee structure.

167
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,240
I would be clicking on fee structure.

168
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,370
So that's how the pre structure looks like.

169
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,930
That's why we are having so much labels in this fee structure.

170
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:39,190
You can might also add this to the table in our database named as fee structure and then you can fetch

171
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:44,890
the card from there or also because the fee structure will not be changed in this project.

172
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,520
So that will be staying the same.

173
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,100
Or you can do that as well.

174
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,460
But I have initialized every field by using the label in our fee structure class.

175
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,610
So that's how it is look like and.

176
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,290
Now.

177
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,460
Now, wait a minute.

178
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,900
Estonian fee from stolen fee form will look like this.

179
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,370
We'll selecting the roll number.

180
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,540
The roll number will be displayed when we add the student's name for this name.

181
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,210
Select from the course branch and semesters as well.

182
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,220
Total payable amount you can write.

183
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,020
I'll be clicking on back.

184
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,300
So this is about all the classes.

185
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,350
Of this project.

186
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,690
In the next video, we will have a look on the live run of this project.
