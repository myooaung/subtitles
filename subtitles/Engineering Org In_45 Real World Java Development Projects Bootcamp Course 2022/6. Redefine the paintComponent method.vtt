WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.250
Now the next thing, we have to redefine the print component marker.

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.630
So here we will create a draw start message method to display a message prompting us to click Start

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.140
again.

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.180
So

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.200
what we will do, we will write.

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200
We all right.

7
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.270
Try with what we have mean.

8
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.270
Look, try it.

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.340
Start.

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:45.540
Message give the barometer with the graphics to the with the key curly bracket open.

11
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.340
Check the condition with the game over here and there that we have to set the font.

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:04.200
Okay so de je dot said font and here I will write.

13
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.570
I will ride.

14
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.770
Get fond.

15
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:21.520
And after that, I will take the phone here and give the phone not pulled.

16
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.260
Cuomo, 18, sighs.

17
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.310
Okay.

18
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.080
So now we have to take the set color here.

19
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.330
Go ahead with the foreground color.

20
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.180
Now, another thing which we need a string which will take our message to string as is equal to.

21
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.560
Here I will write.

22
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.080
Click here to start.

23
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.830
New game.

24
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.380
Okay.

25
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.230
So we have created our string.

26
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.280
Now we need to draw.

27
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.570
String in truss string here.

28
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.590
Okay.

29
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.310
So here I will get the S and after that what we will do.

30
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.970
Just remove the thing.

31
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.820
And after this, take a parenthesis.

32
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.890
Right?

33
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.410
Get it here.

34
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.680
Here, get it.

35
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.440
Minus g dot.

36
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.210
Get formed, matrix.

37
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.680
The key.

38
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:59.980
The blind one sighted with the string red string would give the parameter to the s.

39
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.690
And we are done here.

40
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.040
S.

41
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.530
Can.

42
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.750
Something wrong here?

43
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.870
S.

44
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.580
Comma.

45
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.300
Just add food, too.

46
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.210
We have.

47
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.520
Q Just one minute.

48
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.860
Can't this just simply string?

49
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.690
Okay.

50
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.670
Here are what we have to do.

51
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.160
Define it with the.

52
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.750
As soon.

53
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.190
Just remove these things and simply paste this.

54
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.560
No.

55
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.340
Okay.

56
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.320
We will do that.

57
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.690
Know what we have to do?

58
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:37.540
We need a get height and dash margin and.

59
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.890
Okay.

60
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.080
Okay.

61
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.310
Just a minute.

62
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.120
Here.

63
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.750
What?

64
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.300
Here.

65
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.010
After this.

66
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.950
Just divided with the two here.

67
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.860
Afterwards.

68
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.880
Just comma and right get tied.

69
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.240
We need to get tied component.

70
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.280
Just Daesh marching in here and we are set.

71
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.970
Okay, so we have done that part.

72
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.380
No, we have to.

73
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.090
Right, the body of this matter also.

74
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.480
So here we have the center string.

75
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.920
As for the given time.

76
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.970
So what we will do, we will call the form the matrix.

77
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.320
Create an option window.

78
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.280
You need to create an object.

79
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:54.420
I will write the g dot get font matrix here and afterwards I will take in assigning is equal to F from

80
00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:06.940
Lord get ascend okay now in the descent is equal to from Lord get descend here.

81
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.580
Next thing is drawstring.

82
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.260
Here, I will give the barometer.

83
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.520
No.

84
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.910
The drawstring here.

85
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:33.810
On give the parameter with the first s and next barometer what we will do as coma x.

86
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:44.790
Nurse here I will write tile size minus F from not string word.

87
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.360
Get the value as.

88
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:55.460
After nine divided with two here comma and.

89
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:11.340
Give Y and plus the right assumed plus this under parentheses under this pattern this is you right tile

90
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:24.160
size minus need another parenthesis in which we will write a send plus this the sent and just to write

91
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.080
whole this thing with two and we are done here.

92
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:38.320
Okay, so now next thing and the final thing which we have to override our matter paint component.

93
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.220
So here I will do override.

94
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:51.700
Which is already protected wine themed component.

95
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.150
Here.

96
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.300
Read component.

97
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.420
Take the parameter to the graphics 2d.

98
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.700
With sheer curly bracket open.

99
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.210
Okay.

100
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.650
Just remove.

101
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.420
Don't

102
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.330
we need the super.

103
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.180
Okay.

104
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.610
Just say it with the G part.

105
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.600
And now what?

106
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:45.860
We will tweak graphics to the g limit but to two d give the parentheses the graphics 2d g here done.

107
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.880
After that, what we have to do, we will take a G to the.

108
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.740
Not set?

109
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.430
No.

110
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.190
Maybe we need a runner finding him.

111
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.330
Maybe we'll see that.

112
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.670
This was the key object to rendering him.

113
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.160
And here I will take run.

114
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.120
Okay.

115
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:26.520
I will write rendering pins sighted with the key and initialize.

116
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.330
Initializing and.

117
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:45.480
This one with the rendering hands and dirt value I initialize on new initialize on object this one.

118
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.950
And after that we will call our matter draw grid.

119
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.170
Hear this one and give the parameter jittery.

120
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.160
Now we need another method callback.

121
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.670
Here draw start method g 2d.

122
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.590
And so here this part is done.

123
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.210
Now we have to respond to the user action in the UI.

124
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.840
Mostly run this program.

125
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.230
We already have a variable.

126
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.240
Kissinger with us.

127
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.950
Just run as a Java application.

128
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:54.830
Okay.

129
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.870
Now, another thing which we have to do is to redesign the user action in the UI.

130
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.560
So the last and the final part here.
