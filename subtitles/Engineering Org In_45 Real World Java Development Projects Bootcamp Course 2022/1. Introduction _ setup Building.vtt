1
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.830
Our project is Java Event Management System.

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.910
So for the event management like registration and add event, then payment, we are going to build one

3
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.410
Java application.

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.860
Four Event management.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.720
So here we are going to use GBC, which is basically Java database connection, Java servlet, server

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.590
deployment.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.200
To create a web application or web platform for event management system.

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.590
So let us see how we can proceed with our project.

9
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.060
So.

10
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.930
What is the event management system?

11
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.950
So we want to deploy a web app using Java for event registration.

12
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.840
So for this scenario, I'm considering university level events.

13
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.170
The events are which are in university.

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.420
To deploy the way back for event management with the help of Java servlet.

15
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.180
So steps of our development are.

16
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.810
First this project setup, which is we are going to basically set up our project in the ID.

17
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.470
Then.

18
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.400
Understanding different tools, which we are going to use first, their understanding then basics of

19
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.520
databases, how we can handle the database according to that.

20
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.080
First step is making connections with Java, Servlet and EBC connection and after the deployment and

21
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.610
debugging of our project.

22
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.910
So we are going to build event management system.

23
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.300
And we are going to develop a web app using Java for event registration at university level events with

24
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.590
the help of Java servlet.

25
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.450
So this is our basic aim, our main aim for Java servlet.

26
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.590
So what is the application requirement so that we can survey the application requirements?

27
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.600
Java program to display web contents.

28
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.950
Like we want to display some web contents through the Java program.

29
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.520
So you should have the basic knowledge about Java, who the Java language is like methods, classes,

30
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.460
predefined methods, so we can use our method and everything and some basic concepts of fuel.

31
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.440
So it's clearly basic language used in database for create tables inserting data.

32
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.650
So we are going to use a square insect Java program to perform all the database actions.

33
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.950
You should know a little bit about HTML and CSS for the front end because we are going to develop web

34
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.030
app with the help of this only like HTML is the frontend, but we are going to develop full backend

35
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.030
with the Java like adding the data to the database and fetching that data from the database.

36
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.500
Then website for login admin or even so, I'm considering here two scenarios.

37
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.530
Or we can say to use case for this application.

38
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.000
When is administrator?

39
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.370
So for the administrator, the actions are like an event or a handle that event.

40
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.160
Then change the details, everything.

41
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.430
But for the guest, they should see the log in and sign up with that.

42
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.600
They should find that particular event and then register for that event using payment and not considering

43
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.140
their full payment method like payment gateways or something.

44
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
I'm just showing the small demonstration for that.

45
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.680
For admin, you should do administrative actions like an event full admin control over there and they

46
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.470
should see all the event details who registered or all things for the guest.

47
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.470
They should find a register option and payment.

48
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.890
So this is the basic application requirements.

49
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.950
Before that you should require a tool or tools we require.

50
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.610
So we basically need Java development kit.

51
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.930
Here I'm going to use Java Development Kit 1.8 JDK 1.8.

52
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.890
Why I'm using Java 1.8 because the server which we are going to use or deploy is localhost basically

53
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.210
to demonstrate everything.

54
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.790
But it is glass server I'm going to use.

55
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.700
So Glass Server supports 1.8 universal.

56
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.480
1.8 JDK is basically for that only then ID NetBeans.

57
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.640
I'm going to use your Apache NetBeans.

58
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.850
Additionally with JDK you should you requirements is Java X Library or you can find on the internet

59
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.920
Java X Library.

60
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.400
It is popular library for school and skill statements in Java.

61
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.340
Then Java E Enterprise Version eight.

62
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.320
We are going to deploy here Oracle database or my school database.

63
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.330
I'm here going to use Oracle database.

64
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.280
Then Glass server or Tomcat server.

65
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.250
Remember in Tomcat server you can change the port.

66
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.760
Of that is a steep server, but in the glass free server you cannot change the port.

67
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.530
So remember http port for glass server is always a date and further scenarios.

68
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.330
I'm going to resolve all the issues with glass free server like there is some port misconfiguration

69
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.610
also there, so you have to consider that.

70
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.810
But before that, Tomcat server supports only Java E version seven till now.

71
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.780
So it is very old school enterprise edition and it does not support JDK.

72
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.830
So for the minimal condition you should use Glass Free Server Oracle Database, Java E, Version eight,

73
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.400
NetBeans ID and JDK 1.8.

74
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.670
These are the requirements.

75
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.720
So we will further proceed with how we can set up our.

76
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.890
The project incited a passionate.

77
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.140
So now we are in the Apache and once you install Apache ID 1.8.

78
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.680
Virgin is currently its long term stability margin here, so you can see everything here.

79
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.260
So first, this is this should be blank.

80
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.930
There should not be any project here.

81
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.740
So go to file, create new project.

82
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.870
You can see new project option here, create new project.

83
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.760
So it will ask for a different scenarios like here.

84
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.610
Also, I will increase this option.

85
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.850
You can see here or a different option.

86
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.450
Marvin And so Marvin entered the basic libraries inside Java.

87
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.130
You can perform Java.

88
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.620
Marvin Also you can see Marvin supports too many applications, but for the simple scenario we are going

89
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.790
to use and here with and click Java Web, you can see we have application web application with existing

90
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.680
sources and XML Click Web application first option here only click next.

91
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.190
Then you name to your application.

92
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.750
I'm going to put event.

93
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.240
Or registration.

94
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.340
Then you can use dedicated folder for string libraries and everything.

95
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.470
No need to do that because it will automatically create some dedicated folder.

96
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.100
Project said the project location and project folder.

97
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.160
You can change it, but I'm going to set default.

98
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.990
Then click next.

99
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:25.550
Then it will take time to create a project so you can see your option chooses not to enter an enterprise

100
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.220
application.

101
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.360
So it should be none.

102
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:33.570
You should choose Hourglass Server or Apache Tomcat, but I recommend Glass Free Server only if you

103
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.890
don't have a glass server.

104
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.270
Go to this option and then you can find your server like everything.

105
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.130
Amazon Server.

106
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.450
Glass Free Spider Server.

107
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.320
Choose glass free server or Tomcat then download it from here.

108
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.310
I already installed and download it blast free server, then click java eight web.

109
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.090
It is after that it is latest Java E Virgin after that Jakarta e virgin started.

110
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:04.440
So Java E eight I'm going to use here and this is the context but it should be same as your project

111
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.000
then hit next.

112
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:15.390
So don't click anything here and we don't need any frameworks java server for or or everything click

113
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.770
on finish so it will take time to create default project here.

114
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:26.340
We are going to use some default templates here basically like in Java servlet.

115
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.770
So it will take time to perform some actions and everything.

116
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.930
Once it is done, you can see in this section.

117
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:47.520
When HTML5, which is indexed or HTML, I'm going to cut this part because this is only comment.

118
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.830
So as you can see, this is index.html.

119
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.060
And in this same scenario you can see.

120
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:55.670
Everything.

121
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.820
Event registration.

122
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.530
You can see this is our project, which is we project inside this.

123
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:08.980
You can once you click this plus icon, you can see all the web pages, source packages, libraries,

124
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.240
configuration files here.

125
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.870
So we are dealing with Web pages, sources and libraries don't need to change this file.

126
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.370
Don't touch this file.

127
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.010
So this is all about our project setup.

128
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.770
From the folder, I'm going to tell you how we can proceed with our project.

129
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.440
This is setup only.

130
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:36.400
So remember in web pages folder, you should add web pages, html frontend pages, and in the source

131
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.440
packages you should add packages here.

132
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.820
Before that I will add some libraries by default libraries here.

133
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.000
So we need to install Java X Library, as I told you, for the scale support.

134
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.660
So just right click in the libraries at Java slash folder.

135
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.890
So I will click this slash Java slash folder.

136
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:02.550
Inside this you can see where you stored that Java X.

137
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.060
I will use this Java X as I told you and I will share the open.

138
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.490
So our library is added now so we can where this project supports a school, for instance, also.

139
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:20.270
So if you don't want to do it from here, you can go to this and go to project properties and you can

140
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.330
add or change everything here, as I told you.

141
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.830
Also for this, I'm going to use some Oracle gypsy driver.

142
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.730
But in further I will tell you how we can add that library also.

143
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.370
So this is all about our setup.

144
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.620
So let us deal with what is this works or how it's work.

145
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.050
So index today's HTML is not primary.

146
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:51.150
Don't change the name of index dot html it is loaded file or we can say loading file of our project.

147
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.260
So as you can see in the web pages, there are different things.

148
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.620
But if you go this manifest dot.

149
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.110
This is the what we can say.

150
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.190
This is the version for the loading.

151
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:09.750
If you change this to some another name, you have to change the project properties to according to

152
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.350
that.

153
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.870
So let us see how we can build this.

154
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.730
So I will just deploy.

155
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.590
With this and inside this I will print hello world.

156
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.690
So our deployment is very simple.

157
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.240
What are you going to do?

158
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.130
Go to this event.

159
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.450
Raise that project.

160
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.150
Clean and build.

161
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.090
So what?

162
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.780
Just build it.

163
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.820
What it will be.

164
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.160
Do.

165
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.420
It will show the only the building part.

166
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:44.190
But in the cleaning part it will remove the particular non usable libraries, non usable dependencies,

167
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.710
and it will cleanly build.

168
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.660
So as you can see, our build is successful and total time.

169
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.340
So now you can run this from the project.

170
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.800
From for the new project.

171
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.150
It will take time.

172
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.640
So I will show you how we can go with our.

173
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.260
Running time.

174
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.970
So wait for some time.

175
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:12.430
It will take around 2 to 3 minutes.

176
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.590
Once it is successful, you you can see building successful this message again and in the class server

177
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.860
you can see event registration is successfully deployed.

178
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.310
So remember if you are ordered or what we can say the port of.

179
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.910
The database is also 88 localhost.

180
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.190
You should change that port using some commands.

181
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.450
I will tell you further how you can change the commands there also.

182
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.230
So this is a date I'm going to use glass face port.

183
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:52.640
Otherwise you can change the glasses for the setup, but it takes some complicated steps or you have

184
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.020
to change the config files also.

185
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.270
So I didn't tell that part.

186
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.750
Instead of this, you can run single command in SQL to change that.

187
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.960
So once it is successfully build.

188
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:12.190
You can see in the Chrome where this registration is or we can say a project is successfully deployed.

189
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.490
So this is for the setup only I told you about.

190
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.130
I printed the hello world here and this is now printing.

191
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.510
So this is about index dot.

192
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.290
So as you can see, our index dot is HTML is loaded now.

193
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:31.180
So building successful the beautiful thing is about this is once you deploy, no need to deploy it again

194
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.600
and again.

195
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.380
You just print anything like I am printing.

196
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:44.890
This is my project or event registration.

197
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.040
And just click controls to save this.

198
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.340
Once I save this and I click reload, you can see this is again deployed.

199
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.480
So this is what we can say currently running.

200
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.330
So once you have some.

201
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.920
So let us see how we can see this.

202
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:15.990
So as you can see, this is done in our like this one side click control and perform this reload here,

203
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.860
reload again, reload here.

204
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.630
So as you can see, this is added.

205
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.760
So this is how it works.

206
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.760
So once you deploy it, no need to stop it or something like that.

207
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:32.110
I'm going to stop it here because it takes and it requires that put so it will slow down the system.

208
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.770
But once for the small, small operation, you can perform this.

209
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:41.710
And if you have some ambiguity or error in this, it will show this error in class V server and event

210
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.520
res also.

211
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:52.210
So this is very important in this you can if your Chrome browser or something is not opening by default,

212
00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:58.750
then there is some issue with ID or your code, so no need to worry about that.

213
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.160
Sometimes it will happen.

214
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:06.160
So you can use this link also here this one in output.

215
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.450
You can see this output link here.

216
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.740
You can use this link to deploy that.

217
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:19.200
So that's it about our first landing or we can say the successful deployment of our of our project.

218
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:26.850
In the further I will tell you how this Java servlet is working, what is GBK then?

219
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.330
Everything.

220
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.930
There are some methods in Java Servlet also that I will tell you.

221
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:36.210
So we just saw that how we can set up our project and how we can deploy this.
