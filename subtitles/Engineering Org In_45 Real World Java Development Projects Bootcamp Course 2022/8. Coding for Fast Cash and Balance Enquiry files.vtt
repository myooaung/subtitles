00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.430
So in this class, in this video, we will be talking about the classes first cast on Java and balancing

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.400
it on Java.

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.060
So let's have a look at the first class, which is a first class taught Java.

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.380
These will be the last two classes.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.550
After that we will have a look at our run for this project.

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.550
So this class is defined inside the package bank and after that what we are doing is importing a package

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.090
Java dot dot asterisk, which will help us to create a graphical user interface for that.

8
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.040
Page.

9
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.150
And of that we have imported Java event which will handle events over the buttons and swing district

10
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.790
and as well as which will help us to interact with the database and util date which will be helping

11
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.080
to create data objects.

12
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.550
After that, what we did here is defined the class which is extending frame and implementing action

13
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.850
listener inside which we will have a two labels L one and two and there will be eight buttons.

14
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.380
After that, there is a one text field and one string type of variable pin inside the parameterized

15
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.400
constructor of the first.

16
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.060
As we have passed a string variable pin and initialized the current instance of pin to the past string

17
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.360
pin.

18
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.310
After that, we have a.

19
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.380
Loaded the image, bypassing the part of that image to the class load onboard, get system resource

20
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.320
and install it into an image icon object.

21
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.730
After that, for resizing that image, we have created an image object and we have resize that image

22
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.170
with the help of a scaled and.

23
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.860
After that again pass that image to the different image icon object.

24
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.170
And then we have stored that image in our label L3 and set the bound for the label location will be

25
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.290
zero comma zero and the size will be 960 cross 1080.

26
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.560
Adding that label to our frame after that.

27
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.870
What we have did is define the label named as select withdrawal amount and foreground color as white

28
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:16.310
and its font properties that font family as system font type as bold and its font size as 16.

29
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.070
After that, there will be seven buttons so named as as it is a fast gas method.

30
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.770
So in this you will have already values for the cache to withdrawal.

31
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.530
So these are the values like hundred, 500,000, 2000, 5010 thousand.

32
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.970
Then in the buttons there is a back button.

33
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.620
If you want to withdraw from the transaction, withdraw from the current transaction, or cancel the

34
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.620
current transaction so that back button will be used and setting the layout as null.

35
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.200
After that, we have set the location for all the labels.

36
00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:03.050
So L1 is located at 235, comma 400 and it size will be 700 cross 35 and adding that to all three.

37
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.360
After that there is a button be one located at 170 comma 499 and the size will be 150 cross 35.

38
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:21.840
Then we have added a button to whose location is three 9499 and its size is as 150, comma 35.

39
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:30.150
And there are another button which is located at 170 and comma 543 and its size is 150, comma 35.

40
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.270
After that we have added that to our label three then for the button for its location will be three

41
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.080
9543 and that size will be 150 plus 35.

42
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.210
Adding that button to our label also.

43
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.640
After that there is a button five for which we have set bound location as 170 comma 558 and size as

44
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.190
150 plus 35 and setting that, adding that button to the label three.

45
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:05.070
After that, there is a button five setting bound for that button location as 170 comma 558 and sizes

46
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.360
150 plus 35.

47
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.390
Similarly for the Buttons six and button seven, we have defined the bound and sizes respectively.

48
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.640
Then we added accent, accent, listeners.

49
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.110
What?

50
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.070
All of these buttons.

51
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.780
We want to be seven.

52
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:28.280
After that, we have set size of the windows nine 6180 1080 and set the location as 500 comma zero and

53
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.020
the rooted property as true.

54
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.970
And then we have a set visibility of that window as true.

55
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.280
After that, we have defined public void action performed method.

56
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.260
So inside the block what we are doing is a string amount we have taking the resource from the button

57
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.510
and get text substring three.

58
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.260
So tilde three is substring.

59
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.940
We will be storing that amount.

60
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.040
Then we have a connection.

61
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.260
From a connection, we're able to find out that inside the result set instance, we will executing the

62
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.300
query select extract from one bank where ping will match a balance as zero and are restored get restored

63
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.770
restart next will iterate over the record if the string gets string mode is equal to deposit.

64
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.110
So if the mode is of deposit then we will be adding the amount to the balance.

65
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.210
Otherwise we will be detecting the amount.

66
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.360
And in the balance a string number is equals to 17.

67
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.010
After that eight or get re source is not from b seven and the balance is less than it is the amount.

68
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.680
Then what we're doing is insufficient balance and if the source is from B1, then we will set the current

69
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.730
visibility as false and call the new transaction pin method.

70
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.840
After that, if in else block what we are doing is we are initializing the date and executing the query

71
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.170
insert into bank values, pin, date, withdrawal and amount.

72
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:05.420
And showing the display dialog box that debited successfully after it set the visibility as false and

73
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.500
call the new transaction pin set visibility as true after that.

74
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.510
Inside the cash block, we will be handling an exception and inside the static void main method, we

75
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.410
have called the first case with the null values and set the visibility as true.

76
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.740
Now what we are doing inside the Balance Enquiry or Java file, this will be the last file of this project.

77
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.310
So this is defined inside the package bank and we have imported the necessary package like Java or JWT,

78
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.250
which help us to create graphical user interface and Java enabled event to handle events over the button

79
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.130
as well as set to execute queries with the help of resolution.

80
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.720
Instance and swing is a developed or modified method.

81
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.850
Then the AWG package.

82
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.980
Then there is a java util class.

83
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.050
After that what we are doing is initializing our class balance enquiry, which is extending frame and

84
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.860
implementing action.

85
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:03.820
Listener This class will have two text field 22 three buttons b1 B to be three three labels and 2l3

86
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.950
and a string type of variable pen.

87
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.510
After that, we have defined the parameter constructor of balancing query string pin this pin as equals

88
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.110
to pin.

89
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.180
And after that we have installed the image with the help of class or get system resource by passing

90
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.910
the image path.

91
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.550
After that, we have scaled the instance of that image, then added that image to our new image icon

92
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.930
object.

93
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:33.090
After that is told that image icon object into the label, setting the bound or location for that label

94
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.350
that is zero zero and its size will be nine 6180 1080.

95
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.730
And it's adding that label to our frame.

96
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.210
After that.

97
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.160
What we are doing is there is a label one.

98
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.300
And after that we have set its foreground color as white and its font properties.

99
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:58.200
Font family system font type is bold and font size is 16.

100
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.360
There is a button back button.

101
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.420
Label this back, setting the layout as null.

102
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.140
Then we will be setting the location and size for the label.

103
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.090
One that is 190 comma 350.

104
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.020
It is is its location and its size will be four and Red Cross 35.

105
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.970
Then adding that label to our L three label.

106
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.140
Then there is a button setting bound for it whose location will be three 9633 in sizes 150 plus 35 adding

107
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.430
that two also l three.

108
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.980
Then there is an end balance is equals to zero.

109
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.280
Now inside that right block, what we are doing is.

110
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.480
Destabilizing the connection with the help of connection class.

111
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.990
Now inside the results it is instance executing the query that select extra from bank where pin is equals

112
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.480
to pin.

113
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.610
So where the pin will match, we will be fetching that record from the bank and for that particular

114
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.310
record we will select check for the mode.

115
00:08:50.310 --> 00:09:00.120
If the mode is deposit, then we will be adding to amount in our balance instance, if the mode is not

116
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.100
deposit, then we will be subtracting that amount in our balance instance.

117
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.800
After that we will be setting an album that your current account balances balance, so that balance

118
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.880
will be shown after that.

119
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:22.070
One attraction listeners will be one will be adding action listener as be one button will execute some

120
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.610
event.

121
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:32.000
So set size will be nine six to cross 1080 and this property is true after that location is 500 comma

122
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.280
zero and its visibility as to.

123
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:42.190
After that we have defined the action perform the method which is taking action event a and setup visibility

124
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.280
of the current window as false and the new transaction.

125
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.650
We have called the new transaction by passing the string pin and center visibility as true.

126
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.320
So this will move us to the new transaction page.

127
00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.490
Now inside the main method, we have called a new balance inquiry with the null values and set the possibility

128
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.120
as true.

129
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.630
So these are all the two last two classes of this project.

130
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.680
In the next video we will be having a look at the live of this project and.
