1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.730
So it is the book package class.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.160
So it is defined inside the package travel.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.290
We have imported the necessary packages which will be used in this class.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.440
Then there is a public class book package extending the frame.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.360
There is a private type of panel that is a content pane.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.960
Then there is a text field.

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.330
There are two text fields, three choices.

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.580
Then inside the main function, we have defined the instance of the current class and set the visibility

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.240
as to.

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.290
After that there is a constructor parameterized constructor.

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.990
Set the bound for that frame, adding that panel and adding that panel to frame setting the layout of

12
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.210
the panel as null.

13
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.500
Then we have added.

14
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.640
And image and adding that image to the label, setting the bound for that label and adding that label

15
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.480
to our frame.

16
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.600
After that, there is another label as both package setting font for it, setting bound for it, which

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.460
will set us location and size.

18
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.270
Then adding that to our panel, that label to a panel content pane.

19
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.220
After that, there is a label L2.

20
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.660
New label user name setting bound for it.

21
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.520
Adding that label to our panel.

22
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.550
After that, there is another label.

23
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.960
Which will take a username, a string, and then setting bound for the label, adding that label to

24
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.650
our panel.

25
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.020
And after that there is a label select package setting bound for that and adding that label to our panel.

26
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.900
Then there is ac1 choice which will inside choice.

27
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.370
We have three packages gold, silver, bronze, package setting bound for the choice and adding that

28
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.180
to our panel.

29
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.910
After that, there is a label total persons setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

30
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.050
After that, there is a text field which will initially has zero setting bound for it, adding that

31
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.860
to our panel.

32
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.410
Then there is a label ID setting bound and everything for it and.

33
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.700
We can label it with respect to the ID there.

34
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.360
There's another label as a number which will have a end label and there is a phone number which will

35
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.570
have a respective back end label as well.

36
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.360
Then there is a label LP deposit total price and which will also have.

37
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.730
It's back end label.

38
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.260
Now, these back end label will be filled by using this statement and this block.

39
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.910
So try block we have initialize the connection which execute the query.

40
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.130
Select extra from customer where username will match and add the text to the as those labels add two,

41
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.660
three and four.

42
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.930
I had a phone number and then we have here.

43
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.210
J button check price for the check price.

44
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.770
When this button will be pressed, they will select the item from the choice.

45
00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.910
Cost is close to zero.

46
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.970
If the goal package we will add cost is 12,000.

47
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.080
If silver package, then we will add cost with 25,000.

48
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:17.400
If Brown package, we will add cost with 32,000 and then cost will be converted into

49
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.390
get text from the text field.

50
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:32.940
And in alpha we will set the cost, then set the bound for that button background and follow the color

51
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.420
of the button.

52
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.990
Then we will.

53
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.210
When we'll click on book, we have performed the action event.

54
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.350
We will create a connection, select the item, insert in the book package.

55
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.950
We will insert into our book package table of the database.

56
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.050
Then we will show the package box successfully.

57
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.370
After that we have set the bound for that buttons, everything background color for one color and add

58
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.450
it to our panel.

59
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.610
Then there is a button which will close this window setting background color.

60
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.890
And I did that to our panel.

61
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.410
And the final finally there is we have set the background color of the window as white.

62
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.830
Now let's see we a catch class.

63
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.210
So we'll package classes and defined inside the package travel which will have imported.

64
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:22.400
If we have imported a necessary package for that class, we'll package classes extending frame and if

65
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:31.020
there is a private panel and the choice instance inside the main function, we have created its instance

66
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.600
and set the visibility as to inside the package.

67
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.520
We have first created the panel, then we have created an icon.

68
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.510
Added that to label set the bound for the label added that label to our window.

69
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.470
Similarly there is a view package detail setting font for it, bound for it, adding that label to our

70
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.920
frame.

71
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.990
After that there is another label user name setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

72
00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.560
Then there is the respect empty label adding that also.

73
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.300
Then there is a label package, adding an empty panel with respect to the package.

74
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.020
Then there is a number of person adding that panel.

75
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.060
Then with respect to that, we have an empty label under the label as ID setting bound and everything

76
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.720
for that under the label as L four.

77
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.590
Then there is a label gender setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

78
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.030
Then there is a label l five setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

79
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.660
Label phone number setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

80
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.190
Then there is a level six setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

81
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.210
Then there is a label price setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

82
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.190
And then there is the empty label.

83
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.100
We have initialize the connection inside the trip log.

84
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.470
We will execute the query select abstract book package from username where username will batch match

85
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:07.420
and then it will iterate over the record of that username and.

86
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.370
11.6 test set text.

87
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.930
This will set those empty labels with the text from the database by getting a record from the database.

88
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:26.490
We will close the connection and after that there is an exit button, back button for which we have

89
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.620
defined action performed method in which the visibility of the current window will be false.

90
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.880
Now the button exit at the bound for the button exit, background color, foreground color of the button

91
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.600
exit and edit the button exit to our panel.

92
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:54.170
At last we have defined the background colour for the window which is as white.

93
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.370
After that there is a book hotel class.

94
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.420
Let's have a look on the book hotel as well.

95
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.780
Define inside the package travel.

96
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.490
We have imported the necessary packages.

97
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.610
Class book hotel is extending the frame a private type of panel content pane two text fields and three

98
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.240
choices.

99
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:19.590
Inside the main function we have formed the object of the book class set the visibility of its.

100
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.390
That's true.

101
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:30.770
Then we have defined an parameterized constructor of book hotel set, setting the panel layout size

102
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.020
and adding to add that our frame.

103
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.120
Then we have defined the image icon added that image icon to the label setting bound for it, adding

104
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.440
that label to a frame.

105
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.930
Then there is a label book, hotel setting, font bound, everything.

106
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.340
There is a label user name setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

107
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.750
Then there is a label which will print the user name setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

108
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.090
Then there is a label select hotel setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

109
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.640
Then there is a choice.

110
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:13.030
C one initializing the connection to add elements in c one results that will execute the select X3 for

111
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.600
model.

112
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:21.340
This will iterate over the record of the table and add the name of the hotels in our choice C instance.

113
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.530
Even after that, we have set the bound for this even added achievement to our G frame.

114
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.440
After that, we have created a label that is total persons setting bound for that label.

115
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.520
Adding that to our panel.

116
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.330
Then there is a text field setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

117
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.160
Then there is a label number of days bound for it, adding that to our panel.

118
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.060
Then there is a text field setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

119
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.370
Then there is a label AC or non AC sitting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

120
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.500
Then there is a choice we can select AC or C select bound for it.

121
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.770
Add it to our panel.

122
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:07.090
Then there's the label and six fold included sitting down for it.

123
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.150
I read that to our panel.

124
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.050
Then there is a choice.

125
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.250
Say three yes or no sitting down for it, adding that to our panel.

126
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.860
Then there is a j label ll be one ID sitting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

127
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.350
Then there's the label empty label for that, which will be fetched from the database.

128
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.050
Similarly, for the number, we have an empty label.

129
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.080
Similarly, there is a label for phone number and with respect to that, we have an empty label.

130
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.200
Similarly, for the total price, we have the label and empty label and inside the trip log we have

131
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.940
executed the result value which we select from customer where username will match and where is the batch?

132
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.850
We will set Delta L three and three L for text with it, type number and phone number of that user from

133
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.600
the database.

134
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.700
Then there is a button payment which will check price.

135
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.480
For the check price.

136
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.830
We will initialize the connection.

137
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.570
So you will not get selected and select from hotel rooms.

138
00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:03.980
So this will select from this will select the details of the hotel where from where the choice will

139
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.530
match.

140
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:11.810
Execute that query and inside the cost it will add the cost per day, full charges and AC charges respectively.

141
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:18.830
Then there is person and person in today's a string AC price streak full price that all data will be

142
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.100
fetched from the respective fields of data.

143
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.050
Then a full percent or days is close to zero.

144
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.420
Then we will be calculating the total with these conditions.

145
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.700
After that, we will set the.

146
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.850
Bound for that button, everything adding that button and there is a button book.

147
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:45.020
When button will be pressed, we will update the book to book hotel values by this query and executing

148
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.850
the query with Execute Update Query.

149
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.400
After that, there is a hotel booked successfully.

150
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.500
Then there is a new button we have added setting bounds for it.

151
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.380
Background color for color for it.

152
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.130
Added that button to our content pane.

153
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.850
Then there's the button exit, which will set the visibility of the current window as false.

154
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:08.390
Then there is a button exit, set bound background color, foreground and exit button and get content

155
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:08.660
pane.

156
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.410
Set the background color of that window as white.

157
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.410
This is all.

158
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.640
How about these three classes?

159
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.500
Book Package, View Package and book hotel.

160
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.890
Let's have a look at the output of these classes.

161
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.050
Let me run this class.

162
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.100
This is how the book package will look like.

163
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.900
You can select package total person.

164
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.910
And when we will click on check price.

165
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.660
He will show you the price.

166
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.680
Google Plus zero.

167
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.980
So if I write seven persons for the silver.

168
00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:58.370
And click.

169
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.570
It will calculate the price similarly.

170
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.390
Then I will be clicking on back.

171
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.680
Then let's have a look at the package output.

172
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.470
That's how the package detail will look.

173
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.510
There is no username.

174
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.750
That's why the package details have not been shown here.

175
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.950
Then there is a book.

176
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.830
Hotel.

177
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.420
Let me run this one also.

178
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.020
This is how the book hotel will look like.

179
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.010
You can select things from here.

180
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.610
As there is not we have not used added the user.

181
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.330
So that's why it is not showing the complete details here.

182
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.720
We will be adding these all the details in our output video of the live run of this project.

183
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.070
And the last.

184
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.670
That will be the last video.
