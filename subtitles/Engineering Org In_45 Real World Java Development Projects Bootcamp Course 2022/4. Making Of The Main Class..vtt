00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.650
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.130
So in the last part, we have created our main class, which is going to be responsible for testing

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.960
and running of our application.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.590
Okay.

5
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.180
So here we created this timeline or Java file, and inside this timeline or Java file, we have created

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:24.500
a class, extended it to J frame and also added a main function which is going to like responsible for

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.930
running this timeline function or we can call it for the timeline of class.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.000
Now again, we like introduced a constructor timeline which is containing the layout and the look of

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.240
the frame, how this frame is going to look, the exit and close button, the title and everything is

10
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.960
consistent inside this constructor and also making the frame resizable and visible, setting the boolean

11
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.050
variables to prove our case.

12
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.790
Also, we have created a base class which is extended to G panel.

13
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.700
Then what is this base is actually doing?

14
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.840
So we used card layout what actually a card layout is.

15
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.300
So a card layout is basically a class in Java which man manages the components in a manner that at the

16
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.610
time only one component is visible.

17
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.240
So how do we have so many components the home, the schedule, the timeline, the home page and the

18
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.410
end?

19
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.670
So basically they are present in a same application, but at the time only one page is visible.

20
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.340
Or we can say that only one card is visible.

21
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.340
So this card layout is enabling the font, like enabling the project to make only one page visible at

22
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.610
a specific time.

23
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:52.820
So yes, we have used this card layout for aligning this home help schedule, timeline and end page

24
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.010
in a project and making them visible one by one whenever they are called.

25
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.160
So now our next concern is to create a home class, or this home class is going to handle this frame

26
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.710
where you can see this part is like going to be covered inside the home class.

27
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.810
We are going to create a home Java file inside the ASIC folder only.

28
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.880
So yes, hitting on the right like right click and then you file creating a home Java file inside this

29
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.600
RC folder.

30
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.050
And here it is created a public class home.

31
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.560
So here you can see that we are having a home.

32
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.070
So as far we have created the home, the red underline from the home has disappeared.

33
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.890
Now we will creating the home class.

34
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:51.410
And so let us first extended the ACG panel again as we are going to have a dedicated panel for the home.

35
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.780
Okay.

36
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.940
So the import for the panel is made from the sewing library.

37
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.750
Now, inside the home class, we are going to like declare some of the objects such as base.

38
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.760
So we were having a base we created inside the main class.

39
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.910
So we are like declaring that base here also in order to access it in this file.

40
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.750
Also there is an intro in the home page.

41
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.920
We have already seen the central part had this intro part.

42
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.040
It is present as the center of the page and also what are the left things?

43
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.870
So these are two buttons we are having here, a start button and the help page button.

44
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.540
So let us create a buttons.

45
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.590
Four and call it as buttons.

46
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.660
So, yes, these are for the two buttons.

47
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.670
Now let us set the layout for the what we say the home.

48
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.010
So set layout and we are going to set the layout as.

49
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.060
Border layout like new border layout.

50
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.940
That is going to be a border layout.

51
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.540
Kind of like look given to this.

52
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.020
Pretty.

53
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.690
The homepage panel.

54
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:19.160
And the next concern is to set the like add the buttons and the intro part to the panel.

55
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.620
So here we are having.

56
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.840
These two buttons and these intro.

57
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.530
So we have to add this intro to the center of the layout and these buttons to the bottom of the page.

58
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.770
So, so looking at the layout here we are having this intro and the buttons.

59
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.650
So the buttons are presented the south of the page and the entrance present at the center of the page.

60
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.530
So here we have added the buttons and the intro according to the body layout.

61
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.640
So south for the buttons and center for the intro.

62
00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:01.930
Now there are several inputs made in order to like use all of these packages inside our program.

63
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.890
So we have imported a lot of things from the AWG package, the card layout, the graphics, the grid

64
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.800
layout and the image has here is a major padding and available buttons.

65
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.340
So we are having buttons of course, action event and action is not for these making these two buttons

66
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.110
like a functioning.

67
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.060
So we have to add action listeners to these two buttons in order to make them functional.

68
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.230
Now we have already created this whole class.

69
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.910
Now moving forward, we have to create a paint paint component or we can call it as a paint component

70
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.720
function.

71
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.300
So public void paint component and this paint component is going to be okay.

72
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.310
So let me create it first.

73
00:05:51.340 --> 00:06:02.290
Paint component graphics g we're calling the graphics g support paint component.

74
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.720
And passing.

75
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.340
Okay, so here it is.

76
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.490
Okay.

77
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.800
So here you can see that I have created a function paint component.

78
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.730
So what is this method actually doing?

79
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:22.740
So this method is needed to draw something on the panel other than the drawing that the background color.

80
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.460
So suppose there is a background color of a like a gray grayish background color and we have drawn this

81
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.160
background image to this homepage.

82
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.570
So for this we are like importing this paint component method.

83
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:43.740
This method is already existing in the panel class so that we need to use the super declaration to add

84
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.300
something to this method.

85
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.060
So we have used this super declaration to add this graphics g to the frame.

86
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.880
So yes, this was about this paint component.

87
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.830
Now the next part, which we are going to create is going to be the intro.

88
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:05.160
So we are going to create a class for the intro inside this form, that Java file.

89
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.320
So let us create the class for the intro.

90
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:20.690
The class intro, which we have already declared about and extending it to Japan and again.

91
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.310
Okay.

92
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:31.820
So our inside this class intro, we are again going to have a base and a G panel, which is going to

93
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:38.110
be a blank panel, basically where we have to write the content which is present.

94
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:45.860
So blank panel, yes, the suggestions are already having them and the text panel.

95
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:54.050
So we are going to write some of the text and also are going to attach an image in the background.

96
00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:02.320
And after creating this intro constructor first in order to assign anything to it and again passing

97
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.800
the base B as the argument.

98
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.390
Now inside it, we are going to set a layout first.

99
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.050
So setting the layout as you create the layout.

100
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.840
So initially we were having a Baudelaire.

101
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.060
Now in this we are having a great layout.

102
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.400
We are going to divide grids for the heading, for the description and for the background.

103
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.680
So this grid layout is going to be like two is to one.

104
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.590
We can say that two is to one kind of frame.

105
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.720
So passing two, comma one.

106
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:36.830
Yes.

107
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.390
So we have set a layout for this intro.

108
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.060
Now the base.

109
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:53.910
Again setting it as B, so whenever we need it, we will call it as B and a text panel.

110
00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:02.930
Which is going to like set a new display text method, display text.

111
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.530
And a bracket.

112
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:07.890
Okay.

113
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.980
So this is capital T.

114
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.090
And.

115
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:21.140
Inside this text panel, we will be writing some text and for the image.

116
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:29.780
We are importing some toolkits, so we have imported our image in order to display here.

117
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.050
This is a image I have already downloaded here inside this folder.

118
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.940
I have created a images folder and inside the images I have downloaded this image.

119
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.870
You can see this is the full image which is appearing here.

120
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.950
And I have set a layout for this image to look like this.

121
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:58.100
Here you can see the weight is like more and the height is less compared to this.

122
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.080
So this is due to the layout which we have set for it.

123
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:10.860
So now coming here, the method to attach any image is to use this dot get image method inside a bracket.

124
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:18.600
We have to pass the path of the image, like where the image is located and the name and its extension

125
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.380
in which format is stored.

126
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.160
So this image is basically importing the image inside the program.

127
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:32.060
Now, this is again G panel for the image we have created that this is the size I was talking about.

128
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:38.250
This is the layout of the image which is appearing here, the the distance from the x axis, y axis.

129
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:43.670
And these two are the or the height and the width of this image which is appearing here.

130
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.870
And we have again use this super method which we have already talked about here.

131
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.470
Whenever we want to invoke this brand component, we have to use this super keyword we can call it,

132
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.170
and the graphics we have already created.

133
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.150
So how this graphic should appear is done with the help of G dot and draw image.

134
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:11.970
So this G is going to import the graphics which we have already imported from the JWT library and this

135
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:19.080
image is basically a component from the graphics plus inside the AWP package, which will draw the image

136
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.020
according to the layout, whatever we have set for it.

137
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:27.960
Now again, adding the text panel and image on to the frame we have.

138
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:34.020
We have to use that keyword every time in order to add anything to the frame so that we have created

139
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.100
the intro class.

140
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:42.990
The next class, which we are going to create is this are the split text again extending it to J panel.

141
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.020
So this class is for displaying the text here.

142
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.470
You can see there are some of the text appearing in the frame.

143
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:56.850
Then this display text is containing the text which has to appear inside the home page or home class,

144
00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.930
whatever we call it.

145
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.450
So we are having a J label for the title and the subtitle and the description.

146
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.660
So this is the title Task Planner.

147
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.950
This is the subtitle Task Management Made Easy and this is the description.

148
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:18.240
So all of all three of them we have declared as a label or and again, so there are three different

149
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.640
fonts for all three of them and you can see there are three different sizes for all three of them.

150
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:31.170
So creating this display text constructor inside the display text class, we have to set a layout.

151
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:38.370
So there is a three by one layout and you can see that three by one layout or again a grid layout.

152
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.400
We have created this great layout for the image and this.

153
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.980
So here you can see this is two by one.

154
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:49.050
This complete thing is one, this image is one and this is two by one grid layout.

155
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:54.450
But for this text part, we are having 3 to 1 grid layout.

156
00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:02.460
So these are basically the types of layout according to which our panels are appearing inside the frame.

157
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.000
Okay.

158
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.010
So here we have added a title, a subtitle and the description.

159
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.610
So basically we can take them as three parts.

160
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.200
This is the first part.

161
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.050
This is the second part and this is the third part.

162
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:24.730
So these three parts are responsible for this one, two and three fourths, second and third.

163
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:32.830
So, yes, we have added some random description for this this subtitle and this main title.

164
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.050
So I see now what's left.

165
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.880
We have created this title.

166
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.300
We have added the image, now the buttons are left.

167
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.700
So coming to the buttons, we have to create a dedicated class for the buttons also.

168
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:52.040
And extending it to panel is similar to all of them, but we have to implement the buttons.

169
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.250
So as action listener as there are some actions attached to or two of the buttons.

170
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:03.130
So again like using this base J buttons for beginning and J button perhaps.

171
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:10.480
So we are using that these buttons, components of the swing library for these two buttons and setting

172
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.940
the layout in the similar manner we have set it for the above once one is to do grid layout.

173
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:22.210
Okay, so these two buttons are showing the text which is a padding on the button, and this part is

174
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.390
for adding action not to these two buttons.

175
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.920
So what actually these two buttons are doing what action is actually attached to them.

176
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.930
So these are the two actions.

177
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:38.470
So suppose we have created this action, perform function what these buttons are asking for.

178
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:47.310
So if we hit the start button, then that should navigate us to the set schedule java class.

179
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:53.350
If we hit the start now button, we should be navigated to this part and if we hit the help button,

180
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:58.030
then we should be shown the contents of this help page.

181
00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:04.450
So yes, these are the two action results attached to the two of the buttons, and I think this was

182
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.450
all about the Java file.

183
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:13.990
We have created our home function, extended it to J panel and added all the components which is present

184
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.490
inside this frame.

185
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:21.250
Now in the next part we will be creating this schedule class and again, then help class.

186
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.600
So see you in the next part.
