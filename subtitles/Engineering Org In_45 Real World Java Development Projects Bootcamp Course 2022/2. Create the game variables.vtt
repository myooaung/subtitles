1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:09.480
And here I will create my project with the Java template and I will name it as adventure.

2
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.010
I will make it public.

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.690
Just create.

4
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.310
So here I got my adventure game.

5
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.470
Now, the next thing here I got, my class will rename this class and name it as game.

6
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.560
Cluster, Gemma.

7
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.870
Okay.

8
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.900
So here.

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.340
I got my class.

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.540
No.

11
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.390
The first thing we are going to do, we are going to create two objects.

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.270
Now objects are a new concept.

13
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.410
So the first thing we need to do for our game is being able to handle user input.

14
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:58.450
So let's go ahead and make a command here and here I will write system object.

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.420
Just put the scanner in the will to use scanner.

16
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.280
Just give the barometer to.

17
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.170
Mr. Norton.

18
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.960
Here we are.

19
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.150
Firstly, our game is being able to handle user input.

20
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.730
So what I'm going to go ahead.

21
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.760
Let's say the system object and we are going to create two objects here.

22
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.270
The first one will be.

23
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.740
Name it as.

24
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.490
The first one is going to be something called the scanner I have created and we will create objects

25
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.550
in Java is very similar to the way we create variables.

26
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.020
So here I will declare the type of variable or the object we want and then we give it a name and I'm

27
00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.720
called and I have a name ID in a format and then we will go ahead and see is equal and we can set this

28
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.700
equal to the new scanner.

29
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.560
Then I'm going to go ahead.

30
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.710
I'm going to go ahead and open in closed brackets here and then semicolon.

31
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.390
So we have not actually looked at this at all.

32
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.260
You are going to notice this is a highlighted and so in right here.

33
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.890
Right.

34
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.310
It's because it cannot find this class.

35
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.540
It's not defined anywhere in the packages we have already got.

36
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.310
What we need to do is we need to do something called importing.

37
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.870
The scanner comes with the Java development kit.

38
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.890
This is a built in class that Java has for us.

39
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.680
So if we go ahead and here I will make it to import.

40
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.110
Okay.

41
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.920
Just simply go here and here.

42
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.580
I will.

43
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.270
Right.

44
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.470
And for cha cha cha cha dot dot scanner.

45
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.060
Or I will say all.

46
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.760
Okay.

47
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.550
Import duties.

48
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.190
Okay.

49
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:34.670
So now the next thing which we have to do here, I have add an import for Java or Java dot dot scanner

50
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.960
or the all.

51
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.850
If you're not going use the same idea, you don't need to press or you can manually type this here.

52
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.510
So now to go first of all and write the system got in.

53
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.470
Now this has a syntax looks quite confusing.

54
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:05.210
If you remember from we use system dot dot print line, obviously the old is for output and we can print

55
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.010
stuff out with that.

56
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.980
But the system dot n is actually for input.

57
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.340
So if we put this inside the scanner object.

58
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.370
We are going to put this aside, the private here, here.

59
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:27.520
It's basically we are seeing youth input from the system in this is cannot object and we can use this

60
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.960
in and we can use some of the methods it has to help us take input from the user.

61
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.500
Now, it doesn't really matter if we don't understand the concept of the object fully, but we are going

62
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.730
to use this for input and it's not super important how it actually works, it's how the sort of object

63
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.840
behind it works.

64
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.060
So here we are going to go ahead and make another object here.

65
00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.960
And here I will write the random or.

66
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.040
Equal to new random

67
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.050
random are equal to new random.

68
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:19.020
And here I have created my random object and we are going to make a random object called R here.

69
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.660
Simply make it to the uppercase R and we don't put anything in the brackets this time here.

70
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.350
So what the random is, it's a random number generator.

71
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:39.870
And we are going to be using that for the part of our game and we can go ahead and hit the enter again.

72
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.370
And I will manually just import this object here.

73
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.470
So here I will write import java duty.

74
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.630
Not random.

75
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.220
It's not okay.

76
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.270
It's not necessary because I've already put the star here.

77
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.410
So it really imposed all classes.

78
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.110
But still, I have used this.

79
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:17.750
So here I have done with the input java audio tool at random and again I have done it manually.

80
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:25.010
So we have these two objects here and these are not super important to know how these works.

81
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:35.270
We can use this variable here to get this in, variable here to get the input from user and here I'll

82
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.710
be showing how to do and we can use this or an object here to get random numbers.

83
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.660
So what we will do.

84
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.300
Here.

85
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:53.250
Now, the next thing, firstly, we got over two system objects now, so we can get user input and we

86
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.500
can make random numbers.

87
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.430
So let's go ahead game variables.

88
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.510
So the next thing which we do here, I will make the game variables.

89
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.840
So now we are going to be making our dungeon.

90
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.100
We are going to need a hero in a dungeon.

91
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:23.510
And there is going to be enemies and it's going to be a randomly generated combat and we will hit them

92
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.680
for some damage.

93
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.640
Now, he will ask for some damage and we will basically keep on going until our characters dead.

94
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.290
There will be some other factors, too, like we will use health potions to bring our health back up

95
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.600
and other things like that.

96
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.150
So for the game variable, let's go ahead and declare what enemies are going to win this someone.

97
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.940
So to win this one, first of all, let's go ahead and make a string array.

98
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:02.750
And this string array is going to hold the names of all the enemies that we are going to make.

99
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.680
So here I will write a string.

100
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.140
Firstly, I will be clear.

101
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.040
Okay.

102
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.910
Sorry.

103
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.020
Here.

104
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.470
I will make a string of enemies.

105
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.340
And here I will write.

106
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.400
Our first enemy will be a skeleton here.

107
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.530
So.

108
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.770
The next enemy I do have is a zombie.

109
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.790
And the next one I have the warrior.

110
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.560
Another one, which I have is the assassin.

111
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.800
I don't know what I have done here.

112
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.590
I have appropriately called these enemies.

113
00:08:54.590 --> 00:09:02.090
And then if we remember the way we do it is we can put equals and landless by brackets, and now we

114
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.030
do a comma separated list of enemies.

115
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.250
So I'm going to go ahead here.

116
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:13.280
And I have write the skeleton and the next one I have the zombie here.

117
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.670
And the next one is we have the warrior.

118
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.490
And the last one which I have is the assassin.

119
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.820
So you can put more if you want.

120
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:30.440
The way we do the program is that you can add as many of these as you like because it's going to randomly

121
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.500
cycle through all of them and pick one.

122
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.690
So now that we have some enemies, set up the name of the enemies.

123
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:45.650
So let's go ahead and make some few new variables for these enemies.

124
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.250
Right?

125
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:56.040
So we are going to go ahead and see in the max and it will name some max enemy health.

126
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.070
Okay, so here I will.

127
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.950
Right, Max.

128
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.300
Enemy health.

129
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:09.770
Now, every time we go an attack or going to combat with an enemy, it's going to randomly generate

130
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.180
the amount of health.
