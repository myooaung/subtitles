1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,200
Here is our classes.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,060
That is a first class as a payment detail class.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,850
So this class is defined inside the package airline and we have imported the necessary package, our

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,060
AWG and Java Auditability event to handle events on this window and Java as well to connect database

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,070
to our program.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,240
And Java starts to provide more efficient graphical features.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:37,490
The highlighted packages provided by the library address two examples to model the table from the database

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,540
into this window.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,230
Public class payment details is extending the frame and we have defined the text field.

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,120
One text field variable.

11
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:55,370
Table instance, j label instance and another J labels are flight code capacity class, code, class,

12
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,150
name and label.

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:03,470
So now after that, inside the main function, we have initialized the object of the current class and.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,980
Then inside the non parameterized constructor of payment details we have called the Initialize method.

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:18,720
So whenever the class object or object this class is called, it will first move to the constructor

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,010
and Insight's constructor.

17
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,110
It will find the Initialize method.

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,410
So let's check what is inside the initialize method that is of private void type initialize method.

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,370
First.

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,700
At first it is setting the title of the window payment details, and after that we have set the background

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,840
color as white.

22
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,910
And setting the size of the window at a 60 cross 46 layout as null.

23
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:53,110
Then we have defined the label could be an amber setting the font for that label which font family tahoma

24
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,490
plane and 17.

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,190
Setting the bound for that label and then adding that label to our frame.

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,130
After that we have defined respect to text field for that frame for that label and setting the bound

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,720
for that label and adding that.

28
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,900
Text filled to our frame.

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,780
After that, we have defined a new table setting bound for that table and adding that table to our frame.

30
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,810
After that, we have here creating the instance of the show that is a button setting font for the button,

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,660
background, color and foreground color of the button.

32
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,380
And after that we have set the bound for the button whose location is to end red comma 210 and sizes

33
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,160
150 cross 26 adding that button to our frame.

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,220
And after that we have defined the label sector which is containing the payment details for foreground

35
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,330
color as blue.

36
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:53,170
Its font family Tahoma type is plane size is 31 setting bound for it was location is 51, comma 17 and

37
00:02:53,170 --> 00:03:02,620
size is 300 cross 39 adding it to our adding it to our frame.

38
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:11,560
Then we have defined our number labeled P number, setting the font family, setting it bound and adding

39
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:20,210
that label to our J frame another label as paid amount setting the font for it, which is Tahoma font

40
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:30,760
type plain 13 setting the bound for the plain location is 183 comma to 98 and its size is 92 cross 14.

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:38,260
Adding that to our frame under label as paid date setting font for the that label adding it setting

42
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:46,570
the bound of that label whose location is 322 comma 294 and size is 101 cross 24 adding that to our

43
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:46,990
frame.

44
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,790
Then there is another label check number as this is a paid payment detail class.

45
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,820
So it will have the check number as well font for that setting the bound for that adding it to our.

46
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,860
Frame.

47
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,590
Then there is another label which containing nothing which way, because it will be storing the image

48
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,160
setting bound for it and adding it to our j frame.

49
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,510
Then there is a card number label also setting font for it, adding bound of it, and adding it to our

50
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,720
j frame.

51
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,650
After that, there is a phone number that is the last label.

52
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,040
Setting point for it, bound for it, adding it to frame, setting the visibility of the frame as to

53
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,840
there is only one button that is shown.

54
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,430
Adding action is not on that.

55
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,960
Implementing the action performed method inside the trip log via fetch the text from the text field.

56
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,700
The code of the from the text field is showing in the string code, creating the connection from the.

57
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:53,910
Creating connection by using our connection class and defining the A string, which is a single select

58
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,220
number paid amount paid cheque number, card number, phone number from payment via number is equals

59
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,970
to the code.

60
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:06,120
So results is close to zero to execute query and table will set the model of the table on the basis

61
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,080
of results set.

62
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,230
Now that cash block will handle the any exception if occurs, setting the size of the frame has 960

63
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,020
plus 5590 location has 400 plus 200 setting the visibility of the frame as true.

64
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,170
So this will be the payment detail class.

65
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,820
Let's have a look on cancelled or Java class.

66
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,230
That will be the last class.

67
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:37,490
So this class is also defined inside the package airline and we have imported the package of starting

68
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,530
to define to develop graphical user interface.

69
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:49,710
Similarly JWT as well a W to that dot event to handle event and actual is not on our buttons and Java

70
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,940
dot SQL to.

71
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,910
Interact with the database which we have created.

72
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,190
This is the cancel class which is extending the frame.

73
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,390
Text filled here.

74
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,560
There are five text filled text filled text relevant text to text, fill three and text four.

75
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,140
Inside the main function.

76
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,570
We have just created an instance of this cancel class.

77
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:19,150
Inside the cancel we have initialize inside the cancel non parameterized constructor.

78
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,040
We have called the initialize method.

79
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,840
So whenever this class will be called so in the control goes to the constructor.

80
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,030
Inside the constructor we found the calling of initialized method so it will move to the initialize

81
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,290
method.

82
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,220
So now let's see what is inside this initialize method.

83
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,720
So.

84
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,590
Title.

85
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,080
First of all, setting the title as cancellation.

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,790
Background color as white.

87
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,140
Setting the bound of the.

88
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,910
Window layout is null.

89
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,700
Then there is a label cancellation, setting the font for it and bound for it and adding that to a window.

90
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,280
Then there is an image icon cancel dot png.

91
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,670
Inside the icon here is.

92
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,420
Image cancelled or this is it.

93
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,310
And then there is a.

94
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,120
Label, which is storing that image and setting the bound for that label, adding that label to our.

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,380
Geoffrey.

96
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,190
More window.

97
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,550
Then there is the passenger number label for the passenger numbers, setting the font type and size

98
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:30,940
of the font bound for the passenger number label location 6100 and its size as 132 plus 26, adding

99
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,980
the passenger number to our frame.

100
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:41,950
Then there is another label as cancellation number setting the font for that cancellation number whose

101
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,220
font family is Tahoma.

102
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,230
Type is plane and size 17 cancellation number not set.

103
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:56,290
LB will set the location that is 6150 and size as 150 cross 27 adding that cancellation number label

104
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,280
to our frame.

105
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:05,230
Then there is a label cancellation date and setting the font for it, adding the cancellation date label

106
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,940
setting bound for it as well.

107
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,670
Location 60 cross 200 and size one equals 27 and adding that cancellation date to our frame, let's

108
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,570
remove this which is not in use anymore.

109
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,020
Another label as flight code setting font for font for it and bound off it and then adding it to our

110
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,500
frame.

111
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,660
Then there is a button, cancel button.

112
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:34,740
Which will handle which will send that data of that cancer window to our database.

113
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,900
So setting the font for it, background color, black, white, foreground color as white, bound for

114
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,840
the button and adding it to the frame.

115
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,330
Then there are respective text fields let's remove which is not in use anymore.

116
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,210
Text field setting down for it, adding that text field similarly for the text field one, text field

117
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,040
two and text field three.

118
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,230
Let's move to the action performed.

119
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,690
So there is only one button that is canceled or that sells.

120
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:15,270
So we have a perform a defined action perform method inside which first let me remove it.

121
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:25,350
Inside which we have stored the these packages, these string variables inside which we have stored

122
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:32,130
the necessary details inside the passenger number we have imported or retrieved from the text field.

123
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,620
Inside cancellation number from the text field, one inside cancel cell date from the text field two

124
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,460
and inside flight code the string from the text field for now.

125
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:51,200
Inside the Tribe blog, we have created the connection object and also define the query a string str.

126
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,880
That's the query.

127
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,820
That it is insert into cancellation values, passenger number, cancellation number, cancellation date

128
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,490
and flight details.

129
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,070
So these details will be inserted in our cancellation table, which we have created in our, I think,

130
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,470
second video that is of database and libraries.

131
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,940
C dot dot executable that this will update or insert these values into our database.

132
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:28,470
As we have passed the string string query to that dialog box will appear that ticket cancelled and a

133
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,880
string that visibility that will visibility of the current window set will be false.

134
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:40,740
Cache block will handle any exception if occurs setting the size of the frame as 60 cross 500 and visibility

135
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,950
as true location as 400, comma 200.

136
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,120
So let me show you a run of these two classes.

137
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,950
So let me run the payment detail class.

138
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,960
So if I run this class.

139
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,340
Or you can say Java file.

140
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,760
That's how it will appear.

141
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,260
This is.

142
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,280
I will.

143
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:00,610
Right.

144
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,380
Any number.

145
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:01,900
Let's suppose.

146
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,430
Two, three, four, five.

147
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,510
Two, two, three, four, five.

148
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,940
As there is no pin number, I think not detail in the detail of that number.

149
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,360
So that's why it is not showing here.

150
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:29,480
Let's close it and have a look on the canceled Java file as well.

151
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,020
Uh, I file.

152
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,760
That's how it will appear.

153
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,640
The window of.

154
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,330
Cancellation me the passenger number and a random number.

155
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,120
I'll be writing it.

156
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,160
And cancellation number and a number as well.

157
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,330
Cancellation date.

158
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,680
Let's suppose 21.

159
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,020
One, two, two, two, two, one.

160
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,060

161
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,430

162
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,250
Cancel that issuing ticket.

163
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,640
Cancel.

164
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,050
So this data, which I have just said, must be stored in our database as well.
