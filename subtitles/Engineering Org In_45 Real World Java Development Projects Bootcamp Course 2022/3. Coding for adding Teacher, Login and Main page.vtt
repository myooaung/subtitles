1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:08.680
So here we are on our NetBeans IDE and that's the login class we have opened already.

2
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.470
So this is the login class and here it is.

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.380
So the login class is defined inside the package university.

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.540
We have imported the necessary packages.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.510
Here.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.980
These are the packages.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.440
First is abstract mental toolkit package.

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.110
Second is Java Export Spring package.

9
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.810
And third is the event package of Abstract Window Toolkit, which help us to handle events on our buttons.

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.810
And the fourth one is a skill package which helps us to connect and retain or update information into

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.330
our database.

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.190
Then we have defined the class log in, which is extending the frame.

13
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.520
Implementing the action listener interface inside which we have a frame or instance f to label instance

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.450
a 1 to 1 text file, instance, one password, field instance, and two buttons.

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.760
After that we have defined the non parameter as constructor of this class, headed as the login, setting

16
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.820
the background color as white, its layout as null.

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.300
Then we have labeled the label as username, setting the bound for it whose location is 4020 and it

18
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.910
sizes and returns 30, adding the label to our frame.

19
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.860
And after that we have another label as password setting the bound for the password location is 40 comma

20
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.850
70 and it size 100 cross 30, adding that label to our frame.

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.550
Then there's the respective text field for the username whose location is 150 comma 20 and is whose

22
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.230
size is 150 plus 30.

23
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.650
And it's adding to that our frame.

24
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.200
Then we have the respective password field for that password field label whose location is 150, comma,

25
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.520
70 and sizes 150, cross 30, adding that to our frame.

26
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.950
After that we have defined the image icon which will add image.

27
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.050
This to our login page is scaling its instance and creating another image icon, adding the image icon

28
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.820
to our label, setting the bound for the label whose location is 50 comma 20 and.

29
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.210
Sizes one 5150 Then we have a button labelled as log in, setting the bound for the button whose location

30
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.220
is 4140 and its size is one 2130.

31
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.200
Setting the font for this font family serif font type bold and font size is 15.

32
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
Adding action to the button because button will handle any event.

33
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.590
Setting the background colour of the button, which is black for example, is white.

34
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.970
Adding that button to our friend.

35
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.760
The next button is cancel button, which shows bounce and location or when comma 4000 sizes 120 comma

36
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.770
30 setting the font for the button.

37
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.860
The font family is very font type is bold size is 15 background color black, white, white as foreground

38
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.100
color.

39
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.970
Adding that button to j frame and adding the action is not to that button.

40
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.930
Setting the whole window color as background, color as white, setting the visibility of the window

41
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.940
as to location 600 comma 300 size as 612 standard and location as 500 course 500 comma 300.

42
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.890
Defining the action performed.

43
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.820
Action performed.

44
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.250
Method of the action, an interface inside the tribe via first establish the connection by using our

45
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.130
Quan class inside a string view.

46
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.220
We have the details from the text field.

47
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.850
T1 and inside VF has let us tell from the password field to created a query which is select as from

48
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.160
log in where username is close to you and password is goes to V.

49
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.540
So this will validate the password.

50
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.160
So results it will execute the query by using the connection statements, text execute query and set

51
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.700
execute query.

52
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.970
We have passed the string Q inside which we have had our query if asked next.

53
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.570
So if the query will match and it will iterate over the next row.

54
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.380
So we will call the new project class, which will be the main window for our this project.

55
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.900
It will appear after successful login and said the visibility of the current window as well.

56
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.310
If the login details are not met then we will show a dialog box as invalid.

57
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.560
Login catch block will end the exception and inside main block we have defined the login object.

58
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.220
Now we will move to our project project class.

59
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.580
After the successful login we will be having our project class.

60
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.250
So it is defined inside the package university.

61
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.830
We have imported the same, same package.

62
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.760
A WTW dividend swing.

63
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.200
We have defined the class which is extending frame and implementing acceleration inside the Non Parameters

64
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.890
constructor.

65
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.590
We have had a data university management system its size nine 1920 1030.

66
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.160
Added the image by using a label icon 11.

67
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.080
Adding that label to our DJ frame.

68
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.440
Then we have a menu bar that is.

69
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.480
Menubar and inside there is a one menu master.

70
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.760
And inside the master we have two menu items that is new faculty and new student admission.

71
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.480
So for RM one, we have set its font and added the image in WM.

72
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.600
One background color is white and for the key stroke adding event for the key stroke as well.

73
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.140
After that, similarly we have done for the MX two as well adding image and adding key stroke here and

74
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.820
set mean as be.

75
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.220
Adding action Lesnar to those fields.

76
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.740
And then we have another menu, which is a detail whose menu item is told in detail, and each detail

77
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.840
by foreground colour is red.

78
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:15.550
And then we have set the font, added the image anatomic C key stroke method which will help us to handle

79
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.000
the event on this menu item and background colour as white.

80
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.220
So this is the another menu item.

81
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.610
This is about the detail menu item.

82
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.820
Then this blog will set the font for the.

83
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.600
A detailed menu item image in the menu item monotonic as.

84
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.730
D And this will handle the event and the background color as white.

85
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.340
Then we have added action listener on our E menu items under U2.

86
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.840
Then we have designed another.

87
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.230
Menu that is at attendance inside which we have two attendance sorry.

88
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.800
Menu items.

89
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.010
Student attendance and attendance and attendance.

90
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.840
Not set foreground colour as blue.

91
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.770
This was similarly said the font image metronomic keystroke for the action movement background colour

92
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.410
as white and adding it to our menu.

93
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.570
Attendance similarly, the attendance to that is 40 children.

94
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.640
Attendance setting font for it, adding the image as an keystroke for handling event and background

95
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.670
color is color white and adding that to our attendance menu.

96
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.080
Similarly, we have added action listener to those menu items.

97
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.140
After that, we have another menu attendance detail whose menu items are student attendance detail and

98
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.210
teacher attendance detail for one color as red.

99
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.630
Then we have added for the event image anatomic or keystroke for handling event background color white

100
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.640
and adding to adding it to our attendance detail menu item.

101
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.840
And then we have set for the second one that is teacher attendance detail, its image, its make, its

102
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.190
crystal for handling event, its background color and its attendance details.

103
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.530
Adding it to the menu element.

104
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.660
Then we have add an extension to both those.

105
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.630
Menu items.

106
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.490
After that we will have a menu examination inside which we are being examined in detail in Denmark's

107
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.420
background colour.

108
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.270
Foreground colours.

109
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.450
Blue setting font for the.

110
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:23.180
Seven Menu item setting font image melanoma keystroke background color white and adding it to the menu.

111
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:32.780
After that we have C to set font image metonymy as and keystroke color white and adding it to the Zeta.

112
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.520
Adding it to the exam menu detail in situ and adding action is not to see one NC two.

113
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.790
And then we have many report updates.

114
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:48.910
Similarly, we have done the same thing for the R one and R two, adding zealousness to both.

115
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.250
After that, there is a menu fee.

116
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.590
Which have two menu items fee structure, strength fee for one color blue.

117
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.750
Similarly, for the S1 and S2, we have added Excelsior.

118
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.310
Then we have menu utility instead, which we have three things.

119
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.290
Notepad calculator.

120
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.100
Web browser.

121
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:12.350
Similarly, we have did the same thing for the UIT 1.2.3 Adding a listener to all these.

122
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:20.450
Then there is an exit menu inside of the exit item, adding the image and keystroke and the background

123
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.160
color, then adding a listener to that.

124
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:29.870
After that we have added our menu elements and master that is the master.

125
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.490
Inside the Master menu details we have added menu item one and two to inside user.

126
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:40.640
You want you to report one or two fee as one as to utility UT 12.3 and exit x.

127
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.450
Then we have added master to our main menu.

128
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.840
These are all inside the menu and setting the menu bar.

129
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.410
And we.

130
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.510
After that, we have set the font layout is flow and visibility as follows.

131
00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:00.870
Now inside action performed if the we have initialize the command inside the string message.

132
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.470
If masses equals new dimension, we will call new statement.

133
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.480
If it is equal difficulty, we call our teacher.

134
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.410
If it's a student, we call a student real class.

135
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.190
If teacher details we call teacher detail.

136
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.500
If update is trend, then we update the student class and if update teacher we will call update teacher.

137
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.790
If masses equals fee structure, then we will call the fee structure class.

138
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.090
If student fee then we will open the student fee from notepad.

139
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.590
Then we will run the notepad calculator, then we will then run the calculator, then web browser.

140
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.000
Then we will run the web browser.

141
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.640
If exit, then we will close the program.

142
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.570
If a student returns, we will call the student finance class.

143
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.810
Similarly, for the teacher attendance class and.

144
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.690
So then attendance teacher attendance examination details and remarks.

145
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.930
Inside the main function, we have created the object of the project.

146
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.160
After that, we have a teacher class which is defined inside the package.

147
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.530
University imported the necessary packages.

148
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.020
Then there is a definition which is implementing action listener, a frame label.

149
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:05.090
These are the labels, text field buttons and combo box.

150
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.550
So first random is here we have defined the random long first.

151
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.830
This is initializing the long first and calculating the random number.

152
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:20.130
After that we have defined the teacher constructor frame its background color layout as null.

153
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.720
Then we have defined the label setting bound for it label image, adding image to it, adding that image

154
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.300
to the label under the label as new teacher detail.

155
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.900
Similarly doing the same thing bound font background color adding it to our frame.

156
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:36.690
Then there is another label as name adding bound font and adding to adding it to our label and frame

157
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.300
respective text field setting bound for it.

158
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.490
Another label.

159
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.220
Father's Name respective text field.

160
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.480
Another level age.

161
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.630
Respect to text field.

162
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:56.860
Similarly, another label date of birth respective text will address its respective text field phone,

163
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.980
respective text field email ID and its respective text field.

164
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.550
After that, we are having a label class 10th marks.

165
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.000
Sorry.

166
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:17.890
We have here this class 10th max is expected to field class 12 months respective test field and.

167
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.670
Then we have our high number respect for text field education.

168
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.270
Then we have a string to choose from the courses.

169
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.350
This will be added into the combo box and that has department.

170
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.440
Then a string branch to select the department.

171
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.820
Employer ID text field submit button.

172
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.930
That is a button.

173
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.700
They are added into a label.

174
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.740
Then the button cancel setting bound and for example a background colour for it.

175
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.430
Adding action listener to both of the buttons, setting the visibility of the true size, location and

176
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.420
background color.

177
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.400
Then we have fetched all the records from the respective text field and combo box to the respective

178
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.060
strings.

179
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:03.720
Then if the source of the event is from B, then we have the connection created the query to insert

180
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.670

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.520
It showed the dialog box inside cache block.

182
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.980

183
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.120
this current window as false, adding new teacher and setting the visibility as true.

184
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.190
