1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,750
Here is the teacher attendance details dot java file which is defined inside the package university

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:14,040
imported necessary package java dot SQL Java dot swing java AWG Java dot dot event.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,960
We have defined the class teacher attendance detail which is extending the frame implementing Excel.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,820
There is a one table instance given one button stands B one and a string area of a string array named

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,230
as edge, which is totalling blue ID date time, first up and second off.

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,810
Then any string two dimensional area labeled as B which is of 15 class four.

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,810
So integer ie is close to zero and is close to zero.

8
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,740
Inside the non parameter constructor headed as well.

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,470
Teacher details set the size of the frame as attended.

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,430
Comma 300.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,510
Setting the location.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:57,950
As for four 5150 inside the tri block, we have created a very that is select aspect from attendance

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,400
feature.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,420
So this will.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,590
This is the query to.

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,930
Fetch all the records from the attendance teacher table.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,320
So we have after that we have initialize the connection with our icon class with the help of icon class

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,170
that is seven.

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:21,050
Then by using the result is set statement instance we have executed.

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:29,450
Our query is stored in a string queue and after that we have iterated over the results or record of

21
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,220
the attendance teacher.

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:40,670
By then we have stored into our two dimensionality with the every row in respect to.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,970
In this phase of this two dimensional array, first employed date, first and second of attendance.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:56,970
After every operation we will updating or incrementing the rows and initializing the column again to

25
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,480
zero.

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,680
Then we have created the table with the help of one by passing the two dimensional array in the column

27
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,100
area.

28
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,670
Inside the cache block will handle any exception.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,050
If of course, then there is a be one button print adding the location for that button, the scroll

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,680
panel to that table and adding it to our panel.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,150
Frame.

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,700
Then there is a B1 ad actually adding the listener to that.

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,310
But in print and inside void action performed, which is taking x element as argument instead of try

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,600
block.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,960
We have called print, so when we click on print it will call the print method and that will open any

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,110
new dialog box for the printing of that page.

37
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,960
Now each exception e if any exception occurs, then it will catch that inside the void main method we

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,530
have.

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,880
Digit attendance details.

40
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,770
Call it, and setting visibility as true.

41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,760
Let's move to our next class.

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,710
That is a master class.

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,960
It is also defined inside the package university.

44
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:15,010
And then we have imported the necessary packages like AWP, AWP event, Java X dot swing and Java dot

45
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,760
SQL.

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,180
After that, we have defined the class Max, which is extending the frame.

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,980
Then there is a text area t one and J panel B1.

48
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,300
Then there is a non parameterized constructor of marks.

49
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,000
So this is not in use, I think.

50
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,440
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,490
Marks.

52
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,580
String str.

53
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,800
Marks as.

54
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,290
So we are calling.

55
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,960
Yes.

56
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,670
So non constructor doesn't have anything then.

57
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,590
We have defined the.

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,670
Parameterized constructor by passing a string str, setting the size for the window which is of border

59
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:08,340
layout, and then again a panel and a text area scroll panel for that, adding the font for that.

60
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,050
Adding the panel and the scroll panel to the window, location of the window and inside the parameter

61
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,310
constructor we have called a method mark by passing the STR.

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,360
Now here is the method mark defined.

63
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,630
Let's see what is doing inside the try block.

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,560
Initialize the connection now to 1.6 text.

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,780
So it is setting the text in the text free text area actually result of examination and subject.

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,810
Then there is a result set query in which we have executing the query select extract from subject where

67
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,220
rule number is equal to s.

68
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,380
So this will mention all the subjects from the subject table where row number will be.

69
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
A particular rule number.

70
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,480
So for a particular rule number.

71
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,430
Some list of subjects will be mentioned.

72
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,710
So for the RS, one point next.

73
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,170
So for the next record in the table, it will append all the subject list.

74
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,350
After that, there is an execution query which is saying that select extract from marks for roll number

75
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,610
from the Marks table.

76
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,280
It will fetch the marks for the same roll number.

77
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,860
And inside the AIF block we have appended all the marks of the.

78
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:32,340
Particular roll number student and then in the catch block we will handle any exception if occurs.

79
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,550
And inside the main method we will call the new max class and set the visibility as true.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,890
Now we have the examination details class.

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,020
Which is also defined inside the package university and importing the necessary package.

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:06:01,970
Our eight dot asterisk Java Exports Industry, Java Zinc Border Java SQL Server or JWT Event and Java.

83
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,320
And this is not.

84
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,800
Brought to an end, don't ask, don't tell.

85
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,900
So this class is provided by this library.

86
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,550
This will be help us to model the designing of the table in Orlando.

87
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:27,720
So this is a public class examination detail and it is extending frame and implementing the action list

88
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,110
now.

89
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,750
And then there is a private panel content paint table, table and text field search.

90
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,750
Another, there are three buttons B1, B2 and B three.

91
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,310
Then we have defined a method book.

92
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,860
Let me have a look at first.

93
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,750
First, let's have a look on this public examination detail.

94
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,400
That is a non parameter as constructor of it.

95
00:06:50,820 --> 00:07:00,810
Set the bound for the window and adding the panel background colour for it, border for it, adding

96
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,570
it to our frame and setting the layout for it.

97
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,310
Then we have created a scroll panel setting the bound for it, adding it to our frame.

98
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,510
Then there is a table adding mouse listener.

99
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,470
So this will also.

100
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Take handling of event of mouse click as well for the mouse click.

101
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,390
We have passed the mouse argument and in the row table get selected row.

102
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
So set table model.

103
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,520
So it will model the table on the basis of the mouse click then setting the background color for round

104
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,510
color and font for it and scroll panel set point view of the table.

105
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,840
So a scroll panel will help us to scroll over the table.

106
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,390
Be one point new button result x.

107
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,890
Setting the border with the help of color and line butter for one color font.

108
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:58,560
Bound and adding it to our frame or panel, setting the label check result font for it for one color

109
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,550
and bound for it, adding it to our panel.

110
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:10,620
Then there is a search which is a text field, background color, border, foreground color font bound

111
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,930
for it, adding it to our.

112
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,380
Panel.

113
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:22,030
Then we have searched outside columns, so it will have ten columns setting the column for that label.

114
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:31,360
Another level is back on which we have added mouse action is now past the mouse event and set the visibility

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,340
of the current window as follows.

116
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,830
So this is the label which will also handle the event of mouse clicks.

117
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:47,860
Now foreground colour coloured grey font bound adding to that frame.

118
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:55,150
Now another panel named as panel setting the border for it with the examination details title border.

119
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,470
And adding it to the frame.

120
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,080
Panel looks at background color white.

121
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,760
Now calling book.

122
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,840
Now we have called books.

123
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,730
So let's have a look on the book.

124
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,620
Uh.

125
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,610
There is a method book.

126
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:19,950
So I think irrespective of the book, this should be called this is examination detail.

127
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,150
So I'll be calling it as.

128
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,910
Still.

129
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,000
And changing the book here to.

130
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:30,950
It's.

131
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,320
To.

132
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,390
Now initialize the connection select from student.

133
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,630
It will create a prepared statement by using the string as Q will execute that query.

134
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,780
Tabletop set model by using.

135
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,630
Execute of the query, prepare the statement SD and develop a set model will set the model for the table.

136
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,640
Close the set as a result, set instance and the statement instance.

137
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,800
Then close the connection cas the exception if any, occurs.

138
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,550
So after the calling of the stop, then set size, setting the size for the window and set action.

139
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,340
Perform a will if can stabilize the connection from the world connection class.

140
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,440
If the source is from one button, then we will.

141
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:24,540
Call the new max and search dot get text set visibility to so we will call the parameter constructor

142
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,420
class of the max class and set the current window as false cast exception and inside the static void

143
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,100
main string areas, we will call new examination details and set those built as true.

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,750
So these are the three classes which we have talked about in this video.

145
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,100
Let's have a look on this execution of these classes.

146
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,050
I'll be starting from the log in again, so we'll have a better understanding how the program is interrelated.

147
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,190
Hardiman.

148
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,080
And when.

149
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,310
Logging in.

150
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,130
This will be the result of project class.

151
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,370
Teacher attendance details.

152
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,320
Teacher attendance details.

153
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,280
These are the teachers.

154
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,820
We have not added any details, so that's why it is not showing anything here.

155
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,230
I'll be.

156
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,430
Displaying it.

157
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,870
Examination details.
