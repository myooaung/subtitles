1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:09,470
So in the previous video we have talked about the total money and part getting it and updating it.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,180
Now we will discuss about the total money spent.

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:21,020
Like if a school will pay to the teachers, we have to return it by a function.

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,080
Total money spent.

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,130
So let's write it.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,260
So the total money spent is returned through this function.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,730
Returns total money spent by the school?

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,450
Yes.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,650
So this returns the total money spent by the school for paying the salary of teachers or anything like

10
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,130
so.

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:01:00,440
Now, suppose if our school earns 20,000 and the salary of the teacher is 700.

12
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:09,320
So if the school pays 700 to the teacher, what will be the fund left with the school?

13
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,060
So it would be like 2000 -700.

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,900
And this will equals to 1300 bucks.

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:28,160
So this part does the calculation for that only public static void update total money spent.

16
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:34,730
So this updates the money spent.

17
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,040
Yes.

18
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,890
So.

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,390
Explaining this.

20
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,800
Subtraction part.

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:50,330
Like suppose initially the total money earned by the spent by the school was zero.

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,040
So the total money earned would be like.

23
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,130
Oh, here it is.

24
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,190
Spent.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,420
So yes, I suppose initially the total money spent was zero.

26
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,280
So it was written.

27
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,990
Suppose that the total money spent is zero zero is equal to.

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,160
Zero.

29
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,640
-700.

30
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:32,560
Or we can assume that in the beginning the school has spent nothing.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:41,890
But when the school has earned a fund of 2000 bucks, school has now 2000 to spend.

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,040
So it would be like 2000 minus the argument past.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,180
There is money spent.

34
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,700
Suppose we have spent 700.

35
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,230
So the output for this variable will be 1300.

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,180
This is like.

37
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,670
Subtracting the money spent and what is left with the school.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
So, yes.

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,970
It would become 1300.

40
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,970
The variable will be updated with a value of 1300.

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,900
Yes.

42
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:25,810
So in this way we can construct this class of school with our teacher student.

43
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,500
Total money earned and total money spent throughout.

44
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,400
Now we have successfully completed this school class.

45
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Moving forward towards the main class.

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:47,240
This is the main part responsible for running our school funds management system.

47
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,180
So let's begin with this.

48
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,340
So this main class is responsible for testing and running this Java program.

49
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:03,100
So initializing it as a main function, passing a string argument.

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,830
Let us declare a teacher object or let us create a teacher.

51
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,560
Let her call Samantha.

52
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,260
Yes.

53
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,080
And it is a new teacher.

54
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,360
We are adding the teacher to the dataset.

55
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,860
Yes.

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,910
And.

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,080
Yes.

58
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,210
As far as I did not pass anything to this teacher object.

59
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,750
It is asking me for an ID string name and the salary.

60
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,160
Yes.

61
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,410
So get the.

62
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:47,940
As far you declare a teacher object, it will ask you for these variables until you do not declare it.

63
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,180
They will keep asking for it and showing an error.

64
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,720
So let us give her ID one.

65
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,040
Name her as Samantha.

66
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,720
And set a salary of, I think about 5000.

67
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,580
Yes, fine.

68
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,550
Now, let us add a new teacher to the list.

69
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,970
I will copy that data from here and paste it.

70
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,360
Sorry.

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,630
Bested her two times.

72
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,760
I'm going to add two more teachers.

73
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,620
So let's name those seven second teachers.

74
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,080
Like Mahler?

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,380
Yes.

76
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,630
So the second teacher is Mahler.

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,790
Her idea is to.

78
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,060
The string of name asks and the salary.

79
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,180
Suppose she gets 9000.

80
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,280
She is an experienced teacher.

81
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,410
The third one is one.

82
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,250
So they've.

83
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,340
Yes.

84
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:08,150
So the third picture is possibly currently it is three, as we haven't called it anywhere in the program.

85
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,180
Then we will call this.

86
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,520
The color will automatically change.

87
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,010
So name the teacher.

88
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,100
Set the ID and.

89
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,500
The expected salary for the third one is about 6000.

90
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,480
So now in the seminary, we are going to add a few students to this main class.

91
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,280
Suppose student one Name her someone.

92
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,510
Yes.

93
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,290
So we have declared the object.

94
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,900
Student Name that object.

95
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,450
Suppose the student is new.

96
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,490
So new student.

97
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,640
And in a similar way it is asking for ID name and the fees to be paid.

98
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,090
So yes, the ID for the mana is suppose one.

99
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,120
Name is.

100
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,610
Someone nozzle

101
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,320
inside a string, inverted comma, I mean, and the grade.

102
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,140
Suppose she scored 40 out of 100.

103
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,500
She may improve it later.

104
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:43,610
And why not let me copy the student variable two times, same as the teacher and name the second student.

105
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,400
Four.

106
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,630
Should we name her?

107
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,440
Suppose she is rather?

108
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,090
Yes.

109
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,230
The string to her name and the.

110
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,380
Suppose she scored 70 or 200.

111
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,130
And the third one is.

112
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,230
Jonah?

113
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,560
Yes.

114
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,600
So I forgot to change it forever.

115
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,610
It is to die before you die is three.

116
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,210
String to her name.

117
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,020
And.

118
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,320
Rates for June could be what?

119
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,390
50.

120
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,080
We can say that, yes.

121
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:38,290
So we have successfully created three new teachers and three new students.

122
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,390
Now where to store them?

123
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,760
A question may arise in your mind.

124
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,110
So go to the previous part and.

125
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:55,840
Remember when we talked about adding like we talked about at least remember.

126
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,740
Yes.

127
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,730
So had the use of ArrayList arises.

128
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,240
The significance of our list is felt here.

129
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:13,850
Now creating a list or teacher as we want to add teachers.

130
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,570
Right.

131
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,770
So, yes.

132
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,170
We created a list named Teacher List.

133
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,070
You name it, teacher list.

134
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,690
You can name it whatever you want to name it.

135
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,520
So, yes, now.

136
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,910
No analyst is created

137
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,280
list.

138
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,200
Yes.

139
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,220
So you can see that the ArrayList is imported automatically.

140
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,990
Yes.

141
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,070
So that list for teacher is created now.

142
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,670
We will add teachers to this list.

143
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:16,090
Now that sin taxes as teacher list dot and like we were adding numbers in their demo dot java file 515

144
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,230
and so on.

145
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:28,030
So we will add teachers in the same way, add some money to the list, add Mahler to the list and add

146
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,740
to the list and Mala.

147
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,300
Marla.

148
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,160
And the third one.

149
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,220
Feature list, third and verse.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,810
Yes.

151
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:56,330
So the teachers are successfully added to the list, or at least you can say it now in a similar way,

152
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,760
we will add students to the list.

153
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:08,270
So after successfully adding students and teachers to the list, now here we have to create a school

154
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,490
where the teachers and students will consist.

155
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,750
So let us name the school as ABC.

156
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:21,230
And this school contains teacher list and student list, which we made earlier.

157
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,910
Now we have to check whether the.

158
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,890
Function is running properly or not.

159
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:37,930
So let us add this out, that the school has learned what what the school has earned in the beginning.

160
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:49,360
So I want to run and expecting a zero output as nobody had paid the fees or nobody is credited with

161
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,320
the salary.

162
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,500
So on running.

163
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:53,980
Yes.

164
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,880
So the school has earned rupees.

165
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,320
Zero.

166
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,950
Perfect.

167
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,940
So yes.

168
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,870
In the beginning, the money earned by the school is zero.

169
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,940
So let us add something to the fund box.

170
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,530
It's like the Mona dot.

171
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,670
Base fees.

172
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
And it is what?

173
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,980
Peacekeeping.

174
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,690
Suppose he paid 60,000.

175
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,280
So, yes.

176
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:40,300
So firstly we have to create the spaces in the student Java, like if the student pays the fees.

177
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,210
What changes are there?

178
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:49,110
So yes, when a student pays fees, we have created a function for it.

179
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:59,100
This updates like let me specify this update the fees of student.

180
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:06,600
Suppose the total fees for the year is 30,000 and student pays 20,000 in the beginning.

181
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:12,390
So the amount left to be paid is 30,000, -20,000.

182
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,880
So yes, we have created this pay fees function here.

183
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:23,100
Now, getting back to this, I hope now this.

184
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,340
Yes.

185
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,330
So now after running this show on running this function.

186
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:41,560
We should receive an output of the fees paid by the mana, which will be the fees earned by the school.

187
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,320
So yes, perfect.

188
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,450
School has earned rupees.

189
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,650
60,000.

190
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:55,870
A student named Tamanna has paid the fees and it is added to the total money earned by the school.

191
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,760
So, yes, that's all for this.

192
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:07,940
In the next video, we will talk about adding more teachers and more funds to the school.
