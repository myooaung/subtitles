1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.750
It's all we have done.

2
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.950
Now we have to check that part and simply run.

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.090
So I don't think.

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.530
Remove this.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.970
Simply saved is on our programming.

6
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:29.920
No.

7
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.410
Here we have the New York lost.

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.930
It's not showing the message.

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.690
So I think something is wrong.

10
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.040
Can we go here?

11
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.230
You can.

12
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.940
Okay.

13
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.130
What can we do?

14
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.210
The chain label

15
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:19.410
to label message and not set next to the.

16
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.100
Keep blank here.

17
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.020
What we will do.

18
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.640
We will remove this condition here.

19
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.000
This one.

20
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.290
One.

21
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.930
You simply don't.

22
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.930
Copy this.

23
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.690
As soon.

24
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.260
Okay.

25
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.100
Here is this.

26
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.870
If you we have to remove that and no simply run our finding an.

27
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.980
And check it if it's showing.

28
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.050
So you have lost.

29
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.420
European.

30
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.120
Living things, not working.

31
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.840
Maybe what we will do.

32
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.650
We can do one more thing here.

33
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.830
Go to the election.

34
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.880
And check it.

35
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.730
Okay.

36
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.680
So we need this election.

37
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.870
But don't.

38
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.130
Okay.

39
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:41.890
So write and or call this matter and action and then save this program and run this again.

40
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.230
And simply we will click your last play again.

41
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.410
Okay.

42
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.660
So now we can.

43
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.200
What?

44
00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:59.990
What application?

45
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.580
One more thing.

46
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.960
What can we do?

47
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:25.140
So change it to the enable labels, make it to the counter so that it will run perfectly, maybe shrink

48
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.710
that.

49
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.290
No.

50
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.950
Okay.

51
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.130
Who?

52
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.450
Hmm.

53
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.170
Okay.

54
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.120
So the program is running good.

55
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.260
Is it interacting with the user?

56
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.880
Randy Clicking on the styles you have lost and again.

57
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.870
So again, if some.

58
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.420
Okay.

59
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.140
Again, here.

60
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.660
If you go right to.

61
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.150
You lost.
