00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.430
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.630
I hope you all are doing well.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.150
And let's start this day with a new project in Java.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.890
The title of this project is School Payment System.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.670
I hope you can see it on your screen.

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
This is the output that the program outputs.

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.540
All we can say that this is the result of this project we are going to build today.

8
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:41.360
So let us begin with the specifications of this project and then start explaining the project what actually

9
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.590
the project does.

10
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.590
So coming to the project specifications head, it is listed that this project manages everything about

11
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.370
school funds or you can see that school's money.

12
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.510
Basically, it is a money management system for a school.

13
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.320
Yes.

14
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.030
Like in our school, we have to pay the salary to the teachers, collect the fees from the students,

15
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.670
and there are many other expenses.

16
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.390
So.

17
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:21.380
So in the management system, the main aim is to gather all the funds and then distribute it to the

18
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.440
required ones in a very managed way.

19
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.030
The aim of this project is to keep track of the student total fees and what fees is already paid.

20
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.130
Who are not, who are not, who have not paid the fees like this.

21
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.060
Also we have to keep the track that which teacher has paid his or her salary?

22
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.140
Which teacher is left to be paid his or her salary?

23
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.770
So take it at a wide angle.

24
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.280
You have a school, you have teachers, you have students, and you have other employees.

25
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:10.070
Also in this project, we are going to consider our school as our main body and the expenses only as

26
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.420
the teacher's salary.

27
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.320
Of course, this is not the only expense as school bears, but in this project we are discussing the

28
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.730
basic concept.

29
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:29.180
So we will keep it simple by the expense of the school as the teacher's salary and the earning as the

30
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.590
fees paid by the students.

31
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.080
Yes.

32
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.180
So let's start the learning, the concept behind this project.

33
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.810
Before making any project, you must wonder what are the consequences of learning this project?

34
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.490
What are the significant features of Java or any other project you are going to build?

35
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.600
What are the significant features of that language?

36
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.740
We are going to learn by making this project and you are doing no wrong as we want to make any project

37
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.460
just for the sake of learning the concept of language and making the project is the best way.

38
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:20.360
I think it is the it is the main way to learn the concept of any language we are going to make projects

39
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.800
in.

40
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.630
So, yes, let us take a dig into what this project actually teaches us.

41
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.130
So the first one is object oriented programming in Java.

42
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.520
Second one is building Java apps.

43
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.150
Third one is core Java tutorial.

44
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.850
So yes, this project is a tutorial which we are going to teach you core Java concepts.

45
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.700
The fourth one is Java School Funds Management System.

46
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.600
As I earlier told you, we are going to manage the funds of a school.

47
00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.350
So yes, in Java we are going to learn a school fund management system project and the main feature

48
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:08.270
of Java we are going to learn in this project is classes and objects in Java with example as the first

49
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.050
feature is object oriented programming in Java.

50
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.190
So that is no object oriented programming without classes, an object.

51
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.770
We have classes, objects and methods that makes the programming of the project very, very convenient.

52
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.340
So let's take a look at what actually object oriented programming in Java is and what are its other

53
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.970
features.

54
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:44.430
So this is the official site of WTC schools and you can learn very good concepts on this site.

55
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.750
So I am open about Java ops and we are going to take a look at what Java ops is.

56
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.960
So yes, OPS stands for object oriented programming in earlier.

57
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.550
We have procedural oriented programming, which was the.

58
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.320
Conventional way of programming.

59
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.540
So let's differentiate between procedural programming and object oriented programming in a quick way.

60
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.900
So in project programming, procedural programming, we have to write prosody or third method, but

61
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.050
in object programming, we have to create objects that contains both data and methods.

62
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:33.430
And the main difference between procedure programming and object oriented programming is that real world

63
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.330
data handling in object oriented programming, the real world data is handled.

64
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.870
But in procedural programming, there is nothing about real world data handling.

65
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.470
Yes.

66
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.580
And the features of object oriented programming or procedural oriented programming are listed here.

67
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.180
We know that UPS is faster and easier to execute and the structure of the code is very defined and very

68
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.260
clear in object oriented programming, in ops.

69
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.440
There is a there are many features like inheritance, data handling, data binding.

70
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:21.860
And with the help of inheritance, we can really create a class with the help of inheritance without

71
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.400
writing it again and again.

72
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.050
So, yes, this is called as drive.

73
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.430
Don't repeat yourself.

74
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.570
We do not have to repeat all readymade classes in our program again and again.

75
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.830
We just have to call that class.

76
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.630
And here it is.

77
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.630
Everything will be applied at just one click.

78
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.330
Yes.

79
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:52.560
Let us take a look at the core concepts of object oriented programming we are going to learn in this

80
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.130
project.

81
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.520
So we have classes and we have objects.

82
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.470
Let's take our real world example of what class and objects are.

83
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.550
Class.

84
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.830
Suppose a fruit is a class.

85
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:13.020
We all know about fruit and the type of foods we eat like we have apples, bananas, mangoes, guavas,

86
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.940
etc. so they can consider fruit as a class and object.

87
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.430
Add some as a member of the class.

88
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.910
Yes.

89
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.290
So object is a member of the class and it is a real world.

90
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.350
Object is a real world entity.

91
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.920
We can define the object as it is a member of class and it is a real world entity.

92
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.200
So coming back to the project part in this project we have three Java classes.

93
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.400
We already learned about what classes are.

94
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:53.320
And in this program, in this project, we will have three Java classes.

95
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:59.770
They will be schooled at Java, teachers dot Java and students taught Java.

96
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.850
So yes.

97
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:07.390
In the execution part, I can explain you what this program is doing.

98
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.940
So we have created a school.

99
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.550
Suppose that the school.

100
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.650
Answer Yes.

101
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.500
One lakh â‚¹10,000 per year.

102
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.880
So yes.

103
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:24.030
And schools should spend for the salary of teachers.

104
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.830
They can.

105
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:36.070
So those schools will give salary to the teachers, receive the fees from the students, and the whole

106
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.980
year fund will be distributed in such way.

107
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.820
Suppose that each student has to pay for your one lakh rupees to the school.

108
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.480
Yes.

109
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.030
So this is the fee structure of the school.

110
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.500
You students have to pay one lakh rupees per year to the school.

111
00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:00.610
So from the one lakh rupees from each student, the school has to pay to the teachers.

112
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:09.640
So we will learn how, with the help of Java, we will distribute the salaries and the students fees

113
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.050
and receive what?

114
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.680
The money?

115
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.440
What the.

116
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.870
What is the fund left in the school at the end?

117
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:23.920
So let's start the project with the coding execution part in the next review.

118
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.940
Thank you.
