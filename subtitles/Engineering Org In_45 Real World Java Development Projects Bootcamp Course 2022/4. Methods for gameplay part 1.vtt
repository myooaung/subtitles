1
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.540
So in previous things.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.400
So I created two simple logic things, which is basically if you win, win a game and if you lose a

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.360
game, I create it.

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.260
If you haven't bought it, please just watch that part.

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:23.360
And now after this, I need to mention basically keystroke things, which is very simple, which is

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.120
I'm going to create some key events.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.900
Let me mention as public or public void again, because I'm not returning anything.

8
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.890
And let me mention as key press events, which is the key pressed.

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.160
With.

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.390
He went so is giving me treatment so in previous cases.

11
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.470
Well, we do need to widescreen monitor.

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.560
Okay.

13
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.140
Now there is just nothing.

14
00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.430
Okay.

15
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.800
So in previous things, as you can see, I created one thing which is basically public void paint,

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.930
painting that part for the graphics purpose.

17
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.980
Now I need to mention, even for the main mechanism of pedal moving, player moving and everything,

18
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.900
so it will hold all the.

19
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.540
Key mechanisms build.

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.380
Or first condition if.

21
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.640
E dot get key you can check your get key for each key have mentioned key codes, which is basically

22
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370
a right to left or something like that.

23
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.070
So these things and again key event I need to mention here the.

24
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.600
Event.

25
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.620
And last you can check here everything key.

26
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.580
Location key.

27
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.180
So now what I need to mention is basically key week, not 1 to 3.

28
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.460
I need to mention key we care, right?

29
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.410
This is for writing purpose and you can check your everything now.

30
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.770
I will type this because it will take too much part key event.

31
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.380
Not VK.

32
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.190
And once I am giving this right, you can check here.

33
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.150
Right.

34
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.630
So it is not right parenthesis or anything.

35
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.700
If I press write key, it should be moving through the right key.

36
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.250
So what I need to mention is just basically moving that paddle or player.

37
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:36.170
If this is done now I need to mention constraint to that paddle into to end not moving to the highest

38
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.650
part.

39
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.150
So again, x coordinates greater than or is equal to.

40
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.320
600.

41
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.710
If it's greater than equal to 600 watt, it should be mentioned as Blair X, which is basically x coordinate.

42
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.550
So the 6000, which is basically not going away from that.

43
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.060
Ends.

44
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.530
As I'm mentioning.

45
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.920
Right.

46
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.810
It should be going to the right.

47
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.750
So I need to mention move right in here.

48
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.530
So just let's move our existing.

49
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.890
So I will later create that right and everything.

50
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.870
So what is the right thing?

51
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.520
I will create it later.

52
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.990
So this will be the user defined methods, which is I'm going to create it later part.

53
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.520
Similarly, I need to mention all the things four left.

54
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.640
So I will copy this and let me paste.

55
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.200
And now I'm going to change a few parts, which is basically here if you assume that we left only.

56
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.740
No.

57
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.090
At the end it's player X and it should not be greater than or equal to.

58
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.790
It should strictly less than ten.

59
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.690
So why it not goes to that part?

60
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.790
So it should be ten.

61
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.310
If it's less than or equal to ten.

62
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.070
Set it to ten again.

63
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.830
Else move left.

64
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.810
Not move it.

65
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.810
Move left.

66
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.630
It should be moved to the left.

67
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.110
So this is again user defined method, which I will create later.

68
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.090
Now another thing I need to mention is very basic thing.

69
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.340
And we are closely looking this part and everything.

70
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.200
Now enter entering is basic.

71
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.210
So let me again copy this.

72
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.870
Which is.

73
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.990
Do you think and if I'm user prices enter.

74
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.040
Enter which is basically simple slash and you can check your user press enter.

75
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.350
If.

76
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.120
Play which is players you can check your that's a boolean function and as a starting point instead of

77
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.690
two.

78
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.300
Now I need to mention that starting I mentioned as follows Now I'm making it true.

79
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.590
And now I'm.

80
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.240
We think that if users enters a.

81
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.500
For that purpose.

82
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.290
If users enter enter key just.

83
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.470
Or places in Turkey.

84
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.050
I need to mention bold position X.

85
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.260
Then.

86
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:28.790
Now I'm mentioning that at at random positions and I made a mistake.

87
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:37.880
Ball position why again I'm putting it's random position 350 So for the toughness of the game starting

88
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.130
only then ball is direction.

89
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.840
It should be moved downwards, not upward.

90
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.200
So this direction should be minus one.

91
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.640
It should not be goes downward.

92
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.120
So.

93
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.160
And Bold valediction I am mentioning as minus two.

94
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.690
Now.

95
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:04.060
Blair as you can assume, Blair X should be at 310.

96
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.840
That's enough.

97
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.990
Score.

98
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:14.470
The starting score should be zero, always total because you can choose as much as you want.

99
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.440
I'm mentioning as 21 only.

100
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.340
So 21 will be higher score and it will create them on the map.

101
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.610
So that will I'm going to generate later.

102
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.060
But.

103
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.980
To avoid any anomalies.

104
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:34.420
I mentioned earlier this part generator and I guess 3 to 7 is enough.

105
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.130
So I will create that letter and I will tell you what is this?

106
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.330
And this will do.

107
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.710
But now.

108
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.600
Only these things are not enough.

109
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.540
I need to mention one thing here is repaint.

110
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.060
So I will tell you what is the repainting here?

111
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.360
Okay.

112
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.060
So let me show you what my ID is.

113
00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:02.050
Giving the paint is basically creating a rectangle or creating a void in Java 8wt again.

114
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:08.200
So it's just like the recreation of that void again the paint.

115
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:16.810
And this is my, this is my this look and this is my ball position exclude.

116
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:26.940
So now I need to mention move right things, move live things, action, perform things.

117
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:33.510
Because action event, which is basically the bouncing part and some more things like collisions and

118
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.800
everything I need to mention.

119
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.880
So.

120
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:43.590
The game plays are only tough job encoding, otherwise creating good and everything is very easy.

121
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:49.770
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create left and these things.

122
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.790
But before that I need to mention public void.

123
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.570
He released my third year.

124
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.450
And let me tell you why I'm creating.

125
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.440
It's earlier.

126
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.210
Because if.

127
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.770
He went.

128
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.630
E again if I haven't created this earlier.

129
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.290
There may be chances.

130
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.680
Our player will not move that part.

131
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.000
We will not move.

132
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.970
Let me mention again also one important thing.

133
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.750
Key event.

134
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.360
E.

135
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.400
So I'm mentioning these methods earlier.

136
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:39.270
And after this, now I'm going to create public.

137
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.370
Void.

138
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.730
More outrage.

139
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:51.710
You write, I already created you write and let me go with this move.

140
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.020
Right?

141
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.450
Play is equal to two because it's a game only.

142
00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.190
To.

143
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.140
And X.

144
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.060
Position always goes to as at 20.

145
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.880
By 2020 positions it will be moved.

146
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.650
Similarly, I need to mention for why.

147
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:22.930
But with a little bit difference as I'm adding here, I'm again putting this left.

148
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.960
As I'm heading in the right position, which is basically plus.

149
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.350
But for the left condition, I need to mention as minus.

150
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.340
So these things are done.

151
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:44.520
Now, what I need to mention, which is basically actions time starting, time ending, all these things

152
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.530
I need to mention, which is again when another method, public void.

153
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.900
Public void.

154
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.880
Action performed.

155
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.710
Action.

156
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:02.830
Event.

157
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.760
So it is basically depends on action, not on key pressing.

158
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.130
They were the first timer I mentioned already.

159
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.290
It should be start at a starting position.

160
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.860
Start.

161
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.100
After this.

162
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.480
If a player is going to play.

163
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.520
So if play.

164
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.240
Which is always false at the starting, but it will create a new rectangle for me.

165
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.040
So new.

166
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:36.560
So action performed is basically creating a main layout of your energy.

167
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.880
So.

168
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.080
I already created inside parts of that jigger, that ball and everything.

169
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.060
But what about the templates?

170
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:51.210
So I need to create one template, so I'm going to include that in everything rectangle.

171
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.760
With pole position.

172
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.420
X.

173
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.040
From my ball position.

174
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:02.770
Why?

175
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.340
Now I guess 20 by 20 is enough rectangle for me.

176
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.860
With some intersecting methods.

177
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.100
Again, it's very complex and intersects.

178
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.310
With another new rectangle.

179
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.770
So it's just like overlaying on two rectangles with.

180
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.300
Blair.

181
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.420
It's because there should be a player also at the starting.

182
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.000
Otherwise, it will be no use of game 30.

183
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.000
And I guess it is how it is mentioned and everything is mentioned.

184
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.670
And very skewing data.

185
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.030
No, not.

186
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.800
Join me for this bunch.

187
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.280
So.

188
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.750
So I'm not under the rectangle.

189
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.930
Now I need to mention the ball y direction.

190
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.890
Is equal to minus of ball by direction.

191
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:17.240
Which is basically very similar like it should be coincident at the starting point and ball x direction.

192
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.380
The starting, it should be minus two.

193
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.610
ElseIf I need to create another thing because I need to create random things here.

194
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.290
So I will create different, different parts.

195
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:38.320
I'm going with three parts here, so I'll see if I'm going to create here another method I'll see,

196
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.820
which is another condition I need to mention.

197
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:49.930
Similar things I need to I'm going to create that ball positioning, ball position Y and everything

198
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:50.410
here.

199
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.270
So let me do one thing here.

200
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.850
Let me copy this part.

201
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.480
Because I don't want to again and again use such things.

202
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.910
Let me mention.

203
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.200
So what are the different things series or player X?

204
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.890
As I mentioning, as 550.

205
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.930
It should be 550.

206
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.680
There is no errors.

207
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.010
But let me do one thing.

208
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.170
It's basically here.

209
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.640
Let me mention it's 30.

210
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.370
With 40.

211
00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.370
This is enough.

212
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.760
And.

213
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.040
Four in height, dizziness.

214
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.020
So I created this similar thing.

215
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.380
Or let me do one thing here.

216
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:43.890
Let me go with first 70 part 25, 50 and 40, which is basically little bit but part.

217
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.680
Of anything and.

218
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:53.120
In this again, the similar thing, but I will change a little bit here.

219
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.600
Bold direction is going to become bold.

220
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:59.990
It's direction.

221
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.610
Let's one so.

222
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.670
It will move a little bit upward.

223
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.030
Now I am again copying this.

224
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.770
And this time is something new, which is basically.

225
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.950
With 30.

226
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.740
You should be what I should be it only I'm not going to change the height of Blair, which is basically

227
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.770
height of pedal.

228
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.140
Ball position, and this time it's one single condition only.

229
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.610
So this is basically our game logic.

230
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.890
Now I need to mention the collision with our ball.

231
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.390
So.

232
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.030
Collision with the ball I need to mention, then.

233
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.440
Well, let me check what I created already.

234
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:50.880
Ideas?

235
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.330
No, actually, you want to basically also.

236
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.420
In this section event, I created e only t.

237
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:07.810
So I will create one thing here, which is basically our ball code collision in the next part.

238
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:14.560
In that thing, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create one method which is going to collide on

239
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.470
that ball or collide on that platform.

240
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.250
It will bounce.

241
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.170
So I will create such thing in next momentum.

242
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.770
Hope you can understand.

243
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:24.850
Thank you.
