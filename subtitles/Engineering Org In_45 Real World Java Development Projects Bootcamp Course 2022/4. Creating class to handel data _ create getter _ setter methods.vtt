00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:09.840
If you carefully go through this my first tutorial, I told you how we created my client.

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.820
So my client is just going to fetch the data.

3
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.440
And if you are, this is very important part for the fetching data.

4
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.460
It's very small code as you can see and I'm using do post and do great method.

5
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.970
As you can see, these are the override methods and you can check here in inferred annotations available

6
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.380
everything you can check here.

7
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.730
So this is related to male client part and why I created two methods here do it is just going to create

8
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.620
a connection and getting the data.

9
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.930
It's my dependency between undo post is to handle everything and request and response.

10
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.200
So now what I'm going to do, I'm going to tell you what is the same type part here.

11
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.020
So hope you can see this.

12
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.600
So SMTP is basically simple mail transfer protocol in the world of Internet.

13
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.240
If you have seen there are a lot of many protocols for chatting, then normal wave surfing.

14
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.940
Also, if you're looking that http on when you are also there is http and http.

15
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.230
So these are also protocols while doing or providing information on the network.

16
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.200
So these are related to the networking protocols.

17
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.950
But let me go to the deep into this a little bit.

18
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.570
So what is the protocol?

19
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.290
Just like a standard thing.

20
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.890
If you have seen there are a lot of applications only available on the Internet.

21
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.040
Like nowadays you can call to an Internet also, which is basically VoIP or is through Internet protocol.

22
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.630
Also there is voice also, but for that purpose you cannot use one single stream for that.

23
00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:00.570
So to maintain the what we can say logic behind this, then maintain the ethics of internet and everything.

24
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.770
Protocols are made.

25
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.420
So protocol is nothing.

26
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.430
But there are a set of rules, there are a set of layers, there are like header files, everything

27
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.300
are mentioned already in the protocols.

28
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.680
So I'm not going to go into the TV part of this.

29
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.950
I'm going with our context, also with project context.

30
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.940
So every email application available, no.

31
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.340
On the Internet, you just simply.

32
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.660
So there are SMP servers available on the Internet.

33
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.370
Also, a SMTP server is basically just transferring the mail, simple mail transfer protocol.

34
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.040
So these are servers which is providing the SMTP function over the Internet.

35
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.110
So Gmail is we are going we can use for that purpose, which are some SMTP ports and a SMTP address.

36
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.180
Similarly you can use any other is empty between three services is also available.

37
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.050
You can use that.

38
00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.030
So it's a program used to sending message from one computer user based email to another address.

39
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.370
So if you know the email address or specified, you can go to that part also.

40
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.630
But remember, while sending email, it's not like sending one email service to another email service.

41
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.690
You can send email from Gmail service to Yahoo mail also, or you can check for Outlook mail to Gmail.

42
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.490
Also you can send from anywhere.

43
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.140
Similarly, for that purpose, we need one email or SMP server so it provides mail exchange between

44
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.470
users from same or different computers, which also supports.

45
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.440
So sometimes you can see you can send your own mail.

46
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.270
So there's nothing more complicated in that part.

47
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.730
So you can send single message, you can send text, voice, video, graphics.

48
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.810
Yet I'm considering only text only because we are going to create application for video, voice and

49
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.230
graphics.

50
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.750
Also, we need to handle that files and everything.

51
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.100
So it's moving to more complex part for that purpose.

52
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.520
So instead of this, I'm mostly focused on text because we can handle strings easily in Java.

53
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.030
It can also message on the outside of the internet.

54
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.970
Also, if now consider your internet as a LAN portal local area network, you are instead of putting

55
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.240
on local radio network, you can send to other people also.

56
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.090
So this is just short mo thing here.

57
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.120
User a user.

58
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.890
We both are using mailing systems.

59
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.670
So user a user mailing system empty is just email client and it will go to the internet.

60
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.000
This mail gateway it will use and it will go to the another system.

61
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.950
So how this SMTP works actually.

62
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:44.940
So this is all the things build this which is in the rectangular part of the SMTP so you can see so

63
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.990
in SMTP works on the host and port method of the host is basically address and everything.

64
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.860
It's going to work.

65
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.150
So what is our application is going to work here is very simple JSP page or web view.

66
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.130
Our server is going to publish our Web view, our Java program.

67
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.190
What is going to do is it is going to.

68
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.430
Well that JSP page is also it will asks for that text also.

69
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.550
So let me do one thing.

70
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.870
You can put this as this also.

71
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.750
This is also correcting your.

72
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.980
Like it is going to go through this and it is going to do as zero.

73
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.010
So now let me tell you this.

74
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.540
What is this?

75
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.560
So you cannot see like this.

76
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.160
Also, it is going through the server, only it will handle the text field.

77
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.070
This Java programming is going to a SMTP server which is going to find the send mail to give a node

78
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.900
you can use authentication.

79
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.620
Fields also required the username and password to connect that SMTP.

80
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.720
I'm using your gmail service.

81
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.700
So this is it about SMTP.

82
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.410
We are going to perform here.

83
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.370
So if you understood this, let us move with our email application part.

84
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.320
So we already created this.

85
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.900
So I need to create an email message here.

86
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.220
So let me copy this thing.

87
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.300
Make me copy this e-mail message.

88
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.790
And what I'm going to do is the email or mail package only.

89
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.920
I'm going to create a new class.

90
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.960
So you can see here new.

91
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.850
Let me create one.

92
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.100
I already copied this part.

93
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.690
Let me paste this email message.

94
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:45.140
Plus hit enter the default class we'll create for you so you can cook.

95
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.850
So we created this, but we haven't mentioned anything here.

96
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.800
So as you can.

97
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.990
As soon as you created this, it is now showing you but we haven't created said to this all things are

98
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.920
here.

99
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.100
So let me go with this.

100
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.280
So what I needed is your private string.

101
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.210
I needed some packages.

102
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.080
Also, I needed.

103
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.170
So I needed more things here.

104
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.800
So.

105
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:25.870
Let me add one by one to address private schooling.

106
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.630
It's my first requirement to message.

107
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.640
And let me do one thing.

108
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.010
Let me set the model.

109
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.170
And let me do one thing.

110
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.490
Small because I hear the kids.

111
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.400
Then what I needed is from my address, also

112
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.490
from Addis.

113
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.690
So I'm going to mention here from Addis, but.

114
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.480
Or like for handling any purpose I need this from anyhow.

115
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.920
I'm going to put this as you know.

116
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:11.870
So why I'm mentioning earlier, if I'm not mentioning it, will assume as not null by default.

117
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:17.300
So there may be some error cases or anything you can do then.

118
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.340
CC address, BCC address you can add here or I'm going to add it.

119
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:22.940
So.

120
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.260
CC and CC address.

121
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.460
So let me do it first.

122
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.360
I'm not.

123
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:52.710
Focusing on this part because doing a carbon copy in which this things let me control this just for

124
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.190
the opening of the line.

125
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.030
We can use that shortcut.

126
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:06.060
So these for string CC and these are this important thing is for message and everything here.

127
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.490
Remember, for this purpose I need all the things here which is basically.

128
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.690
Subject.

129
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.020
And message.

130
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.920
But again, it's private string.

131
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.840
Subject is important not.

132
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.650
And similarly for.

133
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.530
Message.

134
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.870
So now we are done with this.

135
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:38.630
So but now we need to check whether the type messages is HTML.

136
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:44.660
If you are putting HTML or text, if you are using HTML, it will show the HTML page.

137
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.860
As you know.

138
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.140
So I need to do this.

139
00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:00.660
So we could kill x html slash h html mail.

140
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.190
So for that purpose, I need to specify three things.

141
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.690
So let me just copy these things because I don't want to focus on this.

142
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.090
Okay?

143
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.230
So we are done with this, but we are remaining with some.

144
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.640
So let me do tell you, I'm using static here because these are the statistics here.

145
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.250
Even if the message and everything.

146
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.620
So these are very important things here.

147
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:36.980
So let me add some methods here, which is basically string gate to string to.

148
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.170
So if.

149
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.420
Let me check whether it's.

150
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.820
So.

151
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.290
You can check whether they're adding nice metals.

152
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.880
Now they are added.

153
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.860
So let me tell you how the things are added here.

154
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.470
Otherwise, you may get confused here.

155
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.830
So let me tell you how I added some things.

156
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.820
These get to everything.

157
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.530
So let me just.

158
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:26.090
And what they did so well.

159
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.360
I don't want to focus on gate and set methods.

160
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.130
What you can do in your area, press or insert or your shortcut key on your keyboard.

161
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.190
For me it's all ten insert.

162
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:47.240
You will get generate operator here go to get trend setter and thirds press control and choose for these

163
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.870
things and it will specify for these things all upper nodes these things hit enter.

164
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.930
Now you got all the things here.

165
00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.890
Now what are you going to do?

166
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.680
You can change this according to your purpose.

167
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.100
And what is you are going to use here?

168
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.250
You can change it.

169
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.480
So these are the great CC from methods you can check.

170
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.790
So you can change it according to your part.

171
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.880
It's not compulsory, but if you want to change, you can change it.

172
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.410
Here.

173
00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:29.150
So we are mentioned this, but we are remaining with set message type.

174
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:37.640
Said message and everything get message type also then email utilities meaning let me tell you what

175
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.640
is in that thing in the later part.

176
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.740
So let us go through this.

177
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.120
What is going to do here?

178
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.650
Basically email message.

179
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:54.230
So if you look at this part, this is set, subject set and it is going to put here.

180
00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:04.400
But what is going to work here like get to get to is for getting that to is for putting in this to similarly

181
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:11.530
get from this and from to do this get cc to get cc set cc similarly.

182
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.910
So these are some important I'm putting here.

183
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:20.270
And what I don't want to put this again and again so it will take care of me.

184
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:25.130
I'd put that part for me instead of typing it again and again.

185
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.280
So now we are done with this part.

186
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.330
So.

187
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.260
This is the e mail.

188
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.390
So what is going to handle this?

189
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.590
Handling the data.

190
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.000
Email message is going to handle our data as this email client.

191
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.860
Mail client is going to fetch data.

192
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.930
Email message is going to handle the data.

193
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:50.020
And it's going to create some methods to handle it later as our email application is going to use here.

194
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.470
So I can refer to the name as mail service.

195
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.010
Or let me check here what is in my name.

196
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.600
It's basically email utility.

197
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.450
So email utility is going to work here as sending service for my application.

198
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.890
So in further videos, what I'm going to create, I'm going to create email utility.

199
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:15.070
So once email utility done, we can perform the email action or we can say we can send an email election

200
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.280
after that, but I'm going to handle some emails.

201
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:25.690
So handling email is like fetching the emails is quite a tough job in Java because sometimes there may

202
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.280
be media files or anything.

203
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.070
So for that purpose we need to file handling and everything matter.

204
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:37.600
But sending message is very easy and it's very helpful while sending, but because for the fetching

205
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.380
the data it's very easy or you can see easy job but while sending there may be handshaking errors or

206
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:50.740
anything so we will check that and we are going we will create one email utility class which is going

207
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.710
to have some said email function also.

208
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:59.290
So this is just to handle data and that's it.

209
00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.690
We are going to perform here.

210
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:01.860
Thank you.

211
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.250
Hope you understand this.
