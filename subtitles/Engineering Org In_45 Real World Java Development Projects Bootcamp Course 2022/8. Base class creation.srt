1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,010
So here this is back to class.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,940
This class is a base class for other actors in the game.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:13,660
It simply encapsulates the basic functionality of an object in this game here.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:20,740
So firstly, what we will do here, I will write here.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:33,460
Firstly, we will start with the the private final int and the space variable here to zero.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,460
Okay.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,680
Now next thing which we need is the private in x coordinate variable.

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,030
Next thing is a private and y coordinate variable

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,190
thing, which you need as a private image image to store the images.

10
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,220
So now we need our class constructor also here.

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,660
So I will write public actor.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,760
Sorry, we need the actor.

13
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,720
Okay.

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,120
Okay.

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,090
So now here, I need public actor.

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:30,270
Here in X, comma and Y here and now under this I will send this to x equal to x.

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,080
This Y is equal to y.

18
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,710
Now next thing is for public image.

19
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,170
Got image.

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,450
Here, it will return in.

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,280
So that part is done.

22
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,920
Now we have to set we get a remission or we have to set the image also.

23
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,170
So here I will write public white set image.

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,430
Take the parameter of the image image print on and I will write.

25
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,060
Image is equal to IMG here.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:33,590
We will say the part of our images, in our words, to the public, int x and return x here.

27
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,210
Next thing, what we need is the public.

28
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,230
Okay, we have to take the public into y

29
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,200
take it with the return y here.

30
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,840
Now we need to.

31
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,760
We need the sector for the x and y coordinates also.

32
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:09,650
So here I will write public void state x if the parameter with the index here and simply write stored

33
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:17,110
x is equal to x here need same thing for the y.

34
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,030
Want to say to y.

35
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,060
Give the parameter to the y here.

36
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:34,240
So this y is equal to y here and now we have to complete our body of this matter which we have created.

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,820
So firstly, change the argument with the actor.

38
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,320
Actor here.

39
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,960
See, change this to this one.

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,390
So maybe some of the others will be gone from here.

41
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,900
He.

42
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,840
Here it goes.

43
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:19,800
So here firstly we will take to create the we have created all these the left, right and the top and

44
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,250
the bottom collision marker it because it will check if the actor collides with another actor.

45
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:34,650
It means the wall or the baggage or the one here to the left or to the right or to the top, to the

46
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,310
bottom.

47
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,560
So simply, we have to write only one line here what it will be.

48
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:56,250
We have to return in x minus space variable, which will be equal to astronaut x and.

49
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:05,130
Need the y is equal to actor, nor do I hear.

50
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,340
And the same goes with here also.

51
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,290
Okay.

52
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,040
Move this.

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,160
Here.

54
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,000
What should we write in the write coalition?

55
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:40,240
Here it will end up with this piece so written we need X and up to the space variable which will be

56
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:54,700
equal to astronaut X and y, which will be equal to astronaut Y here.

57
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,550
I'm done here.

58
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,140
Same goes with the top two.

59
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:10,660
Intersect with the y minus space variable which will equal to the actor.

60
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:24,680
First take astronaut y and here it will be x with the

61
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:36,950
third x here and now we need to check for the bottom one also.

62
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:51,290
So here I will write X, Y and z up with the space variable which really equal or not.

63
00:06:51,530 --> 00:07:04,940
So note y and x here will be equal to after dot x here.

64
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:15,740
And so all these matter check if the actor collide with another wall baggage or this one to the left

65
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,370
or to the right or to the top or to the bottom here.

66
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:28,600
Now the next thing which we have to do is to create the world class here.

67
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:35,260
And I will create the world class it will inherit from the actor class.
