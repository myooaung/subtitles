1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.880
So here is the customer detail on Java file.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.990
First we have imported package, electricity package.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.490
Inside the package electricity.

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.170
This Java file will be stored imported the necessary package, AWP and swing and SQL package for database

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.890
connections.

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.300
And then we have defined the class which is extending frame implement section listener.

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:34.080
There is an instance of table one, but for button B1 and there's a string x which is stored as array

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.900
of a string x initialized as customer name, meter number, address, city, state, email and phone.

9
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.200
And there is another two dimensional string and array initialized s 40 cross 60 and there are two integer

10
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.930
variables is equal to zero and JS equals two zero.

11
00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.150
Then there is a customer details constructor headed as customer details.

12
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:08.640
Size of the window is initialized, its location is initialized and then there is inside the tri catch

13
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.940
block.

14
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.030
We have initiated the connection with the database by using our icon class, which we have created previously

15
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.430
in the string as when we have passed.

16
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.720
Select a string form customer.

17
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.170
This will bring out all the details of the customer.

18
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.030
That's the query for the MySQL to bring details of customer from the customer table, from our database

19
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.740
and the results that we have executed.

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.860
The query which we have written in the string as one.

21
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.530
And inside the while we have looped over these rows of the customer details and installed the details

22
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.570
of customer in our two dimensional array VI which we have created here.

23
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.210
So here in the first line, why I as I is equals to zero and is goes to zero say izy00.

24
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.400
We will take a will take the name of the first customer in the database.

25
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.570
Similarly, zero one will take the meter number of that customer address, city, state, email and

26
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.110
phone.

27
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.930
After that first row we will increase the ISE so that the pointer moves to the second row of the array

28
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.670
and change the column to the zero so that the column again move back to the zero.

29
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.330
Similarly, it will iterate all over the values of the customer table in the database and retrieve the

30
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.960
data from there and install the number variety after that.

31
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.080
While we have to even initialize the table variable as a new table past the two dimensional array as

32
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.420
the table and x as the number of columns which is string array.

33
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.100
X contains the column names.

34
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.850
This will create a table in the catch block.

35
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.130
We have handled the exception.

36
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.130
If any kind of exceptions occur, then there is a button which is named print button.

37
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:07.410
We have added the button to the south side of the window and added a scroll panel as well with respect

38
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.820
to the table D one instance and added that to the frame.

39
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.170
And perform the action on that button as well because buttons will be performing events implemented

40
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.860
here.

41
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.790
Define the action, perform an event, write even print.

42
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.750
If P print is as there is only one button of print.

43
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.900
So definitely the event will be performed on that button only.

44
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.540
So the event will be performed.

45
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.440
It will call TX one dot print.

46
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.350
Otherwise we have end the exception and inside the main function we have called the customer details

47
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.910
and setting is visibility of the window.

48
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.600
As now we will move to the deposit details java file.

49
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.520
So we have defined it inside the package.

50
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.830
Electricity importing the necessary files.

51
00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.110
And then we have glass deposit details extending frame implement additional table instance to one button

52
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.720
we when we do a label element L2 Choice seven C to a string x similarly for the meter number of month

53
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.220
units total and status and array by string area by which is 40 class eight is equal to zero and just

54
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.910
close to zero the mostly same like a customer details.

55
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.310
A number of columns are different here and inside the deposit details constructor headed as deposit

56
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.370
details, setting the size, setting the location for the window and its layout as null content and

57
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.050
setting the background color as white.

58
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.490
11 New J label that is a label name is short by meter number and setting the bound for the label, adding

59
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.080
that bound to the table, adding that bound to the window.

60
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.040
Then there is creating the instance of a choice and then label shot by month, setting the bound for

61
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.710
the label, adding that label again, creating the choice.

62
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.260
Second choice.

63
00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.350
And then the table instance table will create the table, by the way, which is a two dimensional array

64
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.930
and x taking as the number of columns inside the we have initialize the connection connection using

65
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.830
the common class.

66
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.770
Selected all the details from the build.

67
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.900
Bill table from our database.

68
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.770
Inside the results that are as variable, we have executed the query, which we have written in the

69
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.590
one a string, and we have set the model of the table.

70
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:34.340
Using this db utils results set to table model method bypassing the results set into this method and

71
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:42.380
as a string SDR to is retrieving data from the customer table from our database, executing the SDR

72
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:50.210
to query by using execute query while orders dot next so it will trade over the customers and add Aristotle

73
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.380
string meta and in the segment choice.

74
00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.130
So when will be this our choice new choice to see inside save and we will add that get a string meter

75
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.700
so we will adding that meta number in the same choice.

76
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.720
Now there is a catch block which will handle the exception.

77
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.000
After that we have setting the bound for the exception.

78
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.090
Adding the C1 to the word block and.

79
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.480
Now here is Seattle.

80
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.310
Seattle's bond has been set here and added the month name in this choice we have and we are writing

81
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.030
the months January, February, March, April, May, June.

82
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.040
Similarly, all the months.

83
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.260
Then we have added the see to to the frame.

84
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.900
Then there is a button named search.

85
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.640
Setting the bounds for the button action listener profiles.

86
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.840
It will perform any event.

87
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.710
Then it will.

88
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.300
It should perform any action.

89
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.080
Adding the button.

90
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:52.170
Similarly, the button print setting the bound, adding the action listener and letting the button scroll

91
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.620
panel.

92
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.380
We have created the scroll panel as well.

93
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:04.940
So as Peter said, 100 bound are sitting here and I read the spy scroll panel to the table.

94
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.950
Jeffrey Then the action performed.

95
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.280
If it is equals to be one, then select a strike from below.

96
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.880
We have a slice, a string, get selected item month selected item from seven selected and from C to

97
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.930
the select item.

98
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.980
Made a number from Simmons, Tatum and Mitchell to meet a number from Z to get rhythm.

99
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.780
Then we will have try and initialize the connection, execute the query and SDB and setting the table

100
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.390
model again, catching the exception if any occurs else.

101
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:36.720
If the B two button is print, then t one print will be called and catch the exception.

102
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.890
If an exception occurs.

103
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.730
In the main function, we have deposited details and setting the visibility of the current window as

104
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.210
true.

105
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.590
Then we will move to the meter info.

106
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.770
Before moving to the meeting for.

107
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.340
We will talk about material for next video.

108
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.270
So in this video, we have talked about the customer details and deposit details.

109
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.020
So let's talk about now meeting for a defined inside the package electricity.

110
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:20.760
Similarly we have called all the necessary packages in this and inside to refer there are labels from

111
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:27.990
11 and 12 to 10 and 11 choice are five choices and buttons are two buttons and they are meter info string

112
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:33.030
meter as past as the argument in this constructor setting its location and its size.

113
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:40.230
And then it's a panel setting the panel setting its layout and its background color title me first is

114
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.800
a meter in for setting the bound for the title, font for the title and ending the title.

115
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:49.680
Then we have the label meter number setting the band for the meter number, initializing that label

116
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.170
again as the meter, setting the bound for that, adding that 11 and 11 to the panel.

117
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.330
L2 is the meter location setting the bounds for the meter location?

118
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.570
Initializing the choice choice are outside or inside.

119
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.720
Two types of meters.

120
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.350
Setting the bound for the choice and adding.

121
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.140
A two and similar to the panel.

122
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:15.470
And then third is the meta type setting the bound for the setting, the bound for the L three initializing

123
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.190
the choice as well.

124
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.380
Three types of meters, either electric meters, solar meter, smart meter, adding the settings bound

125
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.350
for the choice, adding that label and choice to the panel.

126
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.220
Then there is a level five, which is a phase code setting the bound for the phase code.

127
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.870
Now, choice for the Phase Code is these are the choices 0112230 and nine nine.

128
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.450
Setting the bounds for the choice.

129
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.160
Adding the label five and choice three to the panel label for as many type.

130
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:47.680
And said Bond for setting the bond for the label Fool.

131
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.430
And the C4 is a new choice and adding the choice will be normal on two types of meter, either normal

132
00:09:54.430 --> 00:10:01.300
or industrial build type, then set the bond for the symbol, adding the label L4 and C4.

133
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.320
In the.

134
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:04.660
Panel.

135
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.830
Lasix is a new label label that is is.

136
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.010
Setting the tone for the label next level.

137
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:18.530
It's the 30 days, sending the bound for it, adding that label L six and L nine to the panel.

138
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:26.240
Then there is a label seven, which is a note setting the bound for it, and that is 111 zero.

139
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.660
That is, by default is calculated for 30 days.

140
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:36.200
So it will just just this label will print that the default is for 30 days only, setting the bound

141
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.450
for it, adding both panels, adding the both labels into the panel.

142
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.900
Then there's a button, submit button and the cancel button.

143
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.820
Setting the background and foreground color for the buttons and adding those buttons to the panel.

144
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.560
Setting the layout as border layout.

145
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.740
And for the panel, it's.

146
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.590
Alignment will be center.

147
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.350
Then there is an image adding to that label and added that image to.

148
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:13.940
Window at vets west side and the setting the content background color of is adds white adding action

149
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:19.610
listener in the both the buttons payment in be to now when action performed is if the button action

150
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:25.550
performed by be one button, then it will retrieve the meter number meter location.

151
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:33.130
Meter, location, meter type, face code, build type and a string base.

152
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.360
At 30, it will execute the query insight into meter info values.

153
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.840
It will insert in the meter info table of our database.

154
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:45.510
The values will be which we have just fetched from the choices and the text fields.

155
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.990
Then we will initialize the connection, initiate and then execute the query.

156
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.430
Show that the meter info is added successfully by a dialog box and set the visibility of this window

157
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.360
as false.

158
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.750
After that, if any error occur, then will be handled by the catch block and else if the button two

159
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:08.050
is pressed or event occurs at button two, then the visibility of this window will be set it as false.

160
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.180
Now public static void main.

161
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.990
Inside the function new meter info we have setting the visibility as well.

162
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.990
So this is all about the meter info function.

163
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:28.470
