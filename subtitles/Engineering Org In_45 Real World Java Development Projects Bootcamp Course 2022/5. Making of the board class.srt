00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,310
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:11,270
So as far I can see that we have successfully created the flame and inside which we have called to function

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,260
load images and initiate volume.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:25,550
So after these two functions, now we have to create a new function called public void locate.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:35,090
So we have to locate the apple and we have to set some positions for that so that the coordinates of

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,660
the apple are dedicated for this project.

7
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:48,380
So initializing this function and inside this function, we are going to initialize an integer variable

8
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,470
which is going to be in.

9
00:00:52,370 --> 00:01:00,230
A random mathematical expression and which is called using math, not random.

10
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:09,620
So we have called the random function and outside which we have to give this asterisk and called random

11
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,500
position.

12
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,420
So we have to set a random position for the apple.

13
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,750
It is not fixed in every start.

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,260
Like if we start the game again and then close it and then starting the position of the Apple changes

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,070
every time.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:33,310
So this is created for the X coordinate and similarly we have to create this for the Y coordinate.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,240
So Apple X is R and the dot size.

18
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:47,230
So the dot size are multiplied by the dot size.

19
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:56,990
So we have this in our suggestion and we have to create a similar thing for the Y coordinate also.

20
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,900
So Apple has a specific X coordinate and a specific Y coordinate.

21
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:13,010
So we have successfully created the position of the apple with the help of this locate apple variable.

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:21,550
So we have entire and we have to not to declare this or again, it is already declared.

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,300
So, yes, that it is gone.

24
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:29,690
So let me give a quick idea about what this metadata random is doing.

25
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:38,420
So commenting it down to explain the random function calls our number between zero and one.

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,380
Any random number between zero and one, it could be like 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.6.

27
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,870
So the number is going to be between zero and one.

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,620
So suppose the number that is called randomly is 0.6.

29
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,500
So we have to set it like 0.6 to the dot size.

30
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,450
Let us take it to 20.

31
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:10,760
So the X coordinate is going to be 0.6 into 20 and which will yield it as.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,630
And then that bill passed here in this and again, 12 into 20 is going to be 12 into ten is going to

33
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,680
be 120.

34
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,540
So 120 is inside the frame of the game.

35
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,760
We have 300 in the X side and 300 in the Y y side.

36
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:42,940
So we have to set this random function in this manner that the snakes, it goes outside the 301, either

37
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,520
in Y or X, the game is over.

38
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,600
So we have successfully created the locator.

39
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:55,660
Now let us call this locator inside the is in game.

40
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,640
So calling this locate Apple.

41
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,360
The award function is to be called here.

42
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,390
We have called it now after creating the locate apple function.

43
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,980
Now we have to check the apple.

44
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,380
Check that the apple is eaten by the snake or not.

45
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,000
And if the snake ate the apple, we have to increase the size.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,640
And if not, then we have to do nothing.

47
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:32,240
So similarly, creating a void function for checking the Apple.

48
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,270
Public void.

49
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,470
Jack.

50
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,040
Apple.

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,160
Similarly using camel case for the function name.

52
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:53,210
And yes, so we have created a chapel function inside which we are going to call a conditional operator

53
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,960
if.

54
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:06,420
If the coordinate of X is zero and which is equal to Apple, Apple's x coordinate then.

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,420
I Polacks.

56
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,760
And similarly for the VI one.

57
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,270
So if the Y coordinate is.

58
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,650
Same.

59
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,270
We have to copy this.

60
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:32,700
The whole part inside the bracket and attaching it with her and operator.

61
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,240
Replacing the X with Y.

62
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:46,400
So if the X and y coordinate are same as the snakes, x and y coordinate, then we have to increase

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
the size of the snake.

64
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,680
And if the coordinates become same, we have to increase the dot by one.

65
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,210
This denotes.

66
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,740
Let me comment this out.

67
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,350
Like this denotes.

68
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:13,910
After this, I am going to add dots is going to be dots plus one dot size is increased by one like initially

69
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:21,800
the dot size is three and after the snakes eat the apple, the dot sign increases by one, after which

70
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:28,280
we have to call again a locate apple like if the dot size is increased by one.

71
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,770
We have again drawn the apple.

72
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,170
So the apple appears again after checking the apple is eaten by the snake.

73
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,730
So we have successfully created the apple section like we have created a locate apple and check whether

74
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,460
the apple is eaten by the snake or not.

75
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,100
Now we have to set a timer, like if the snake is started, moved.

76
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,680
So if the snake has started moving.

77
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,490
So if the snake hits the wall, then the game is over.

78
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,670
So there is a fixed time like the snake is not moving for the rest of our lives.

79
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,330
There is a time of like 4 seconds, 5 seconds or something like that.

80
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,410
So we have to set a timer.

81
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,350
Until then, if we do not perform any keyboard action, then the game will be automatically over.

82
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,940
Like the snake will hit the wall and the game will be over.

83
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,410
So the timer is like this.

84
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,650
The timer we have called new timer.

85
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,870
And inside this we have passed operator like 140 milliseconds of time.

86
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:41,430
You can set any time you wish to and calling this operator and then calling this timer when the game's

87
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,000
done.

88
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,200
We have to declare the timer inside the board class.

89
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:54,490
And for implementing that timer, we have to implement the action listener to this board class.

90
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:59,320
And this action listener is under the AWP event.

91
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,370
So we have covered the timer thing.

92
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,580
Now the next thing we are going to cover, which so the board is showing some error.

93
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,380
The type board must implement the inherited abstract method action listener.

94
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,300
So we have to inherit this method, so for which we have to call our override function.

95
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:29,830
Like if you know the basis of Java, our abstract method cannot be called without the override function.

96
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,400
So after this.

97
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,990
If ingame we have to check Apple so we will create our in-game function first.

98
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,330
Like I'm randomly adding this.

99
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,880
We didn't see this.

100
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,130
So I hope that, yes.

101
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,320
So the border is removed.

102
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,440
We have added an abstract class for this border matter and now we will move forward.

103
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:07,550
So after covering all the apple and the timer thing, now we will switch to drawing the graphics inside

104
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,420
the frame.

105
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:18,050
So creating a function called public void draw graphics g.

106
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:36,480
So importing this as an argument graphics and if condition says in-game like if in-game is true, if

107
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,720
we do not write anything, just a variable inside.

108
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,930
If then that says that if.

109
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,460
Now India is showing errors.

110
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:55,560
So let me first import this variable, the boolean variable, private boolean endgame.

111
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,540
So endgame here denotes that if the game is on.

112
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,680
So if the game is on is true, then we are going to draw the graphics.

113
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,510
If endgame this denotes that if Endgame is true.

114
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:17,330
So inside this, if I am going to add some conditions as we if the endgame is true, we have to draw

115
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:25,730
image and inside the argument section we are going to set it as apple.

116
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,740
So.

117
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,280
And in the x y we are going to write it as Apple X and Apple one.

118
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,650
Apple X.

119
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,700
Apple Y.

120
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:48,540
And in the observer side, we are going to add this that discovered.

121
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,230
Yes, so that if endgame is true, then this is going to be the case.

122
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,670
And if this is going to be the case, then we have to add a for loop for the dots.

123
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:13,910
So the graphic will be like the for loop says that if the snake finds the door then increase the size

124
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:23,840
of the snake legs, move the snake forward and make it to reach the dot for make it to grab the dot

125
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,160
and eat it.

126
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:32,930
So if that is zero g draw image head, we have to draw a head and attaching with the head.

127
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,430
We have to draw a dot.

128
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,160
So if head then zero L's a dot.

129
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:47,360
If the z is zero, we have to add the head and as it is going to be simply the dot.

130
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,830
So this is how the graphics are going to be like.

131
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,800
If the snake finds the dot, the size will increase or otherwise the head will remain the same.

132
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:06,110
We have to do this by using that toolkit function, by getting the default toolkit, and this toolkit

133
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,420
is with the mercy of AWP.

134
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,280
So tanking AWP for giving such amazing toolkit.

135
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:21,710
So this is going to be the graphics of the game if the game is true, like in game is true if this is

136
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:27,440
true in or we can say that if one so if one then this is going to be happen.

137
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,550
And if zero like if false, then the game is going to be over.

138
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,470
So we have to create a function for game over also.

139
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:45,050
Now in order to create the game of our function, we have to recall that what are the conditions that

140
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,340
makes the game to be?

141
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,740
So the game could be over if the snake hits the obstacles.

142
00:12:51,740 --> 00:13:00,320
And the obstacles are that four sides of the wall like of the frame and the snake head sells itself.

143
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,170
So there are these possibilities which which will make the game to be over.

144
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:14,150
So inside this game of our function, we are going to add that things and then see what happens.

145
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,760
So let me show you that.

146
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,540
What this game, our function is responsible for.

147
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,430
Like which window is it is being responsible for?

148
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:32,240
So that game over is responsible for this thing like this window will open if that the function which

149
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
we are making now will be called.

150
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:42,380
So that is a game over font written in the middle of the frame and everything is black outside.

151
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,880
So let us try to write inside this.

152
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:55,640
Like firstly, we have to write a string message which is going to display a frame like a game over

153
