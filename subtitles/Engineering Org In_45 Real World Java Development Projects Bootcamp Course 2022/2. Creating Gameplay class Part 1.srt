1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:09,240
In previous things, what we created, we created one gameplay class with exchangeable panel and which

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,750
is going to use some key listener and action action listener.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,430
So we will create that part.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,640
But and we are assuming we are, we will create one map functions later.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,680
So now this is done.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,970
But within this game gameplay there is should be key listener also.

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,540
So key listener is basically the keyboard listener you can say.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,390
And let me mention this only directly.

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:44,670
So this will be used for direct reference of add key listener, then set focus focus level for

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,660
focusing the boolean part and which is always true.

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,230
If we want to focus our lives for like that should be fixed.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,260
These are not keys changing part.

13
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:08,850
So let me mention this then said focus traveller wanting travel keys travel please for traveling the

14
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,830
teams and enable not these.

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,810
I need to mention this enabled.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,510
And let me mention as false, because at the start of game, I don't want to create that part.

17
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,860
And in this let me mention timer is equal to.

18
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,400
New.

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:29,990
Would.

20
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,670
Billy.

21
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,060
On Mondays.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,510
So this will incorporate Andy and.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,370
Ingenious download.

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,750
Not.

25
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,520
Start.

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,000
So.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,510
And let me mention this is not in this timer.

28
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:00,980
This is this should be in x dot swing dot timer part.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,530
Always.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,850
So now you can check.

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,260
It's not.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,980
Remember, in Java, there are two things kinds of timer timing.

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,830
One is for util purpose, which is console purpose.

34
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,310
Another is for you purpose, which is Java.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:26,110
So before that, I'm using I'm using Java Util because Java directly took that part, but now I'm using

36
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,430
this.

37
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,960
So this will remove all the parts.

38
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,110
Now I need to create one paint method to create any paint things here.

39
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,980
So let me mention one method.

40
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,100
Public void paint with one parameter graphics.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,210
Which is AWG method graphics.

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,750
G.

43
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:58,300
And inside this let me create method part and I forgot to close the parenthesis.

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,690
So now let us mention these things.

45
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,090
So background.

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,970
Let me create first background.

47
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,110
G dot set color.

48
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,790
I'm going to set color here.

49
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,700
Now, you can remember always color, but I'm using your black directly.

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,690
Color or black.

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,930
So that's a blue thing.

52
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,020
And you can mention like this also black.

53
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,730
For the giving the color.

54
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:36,510
Then G thought I need to create, feel, reflect and react things so I am going to feel which is basically

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,500
rectangular thing.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,850
One comma.

57
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,260
One comma.

58
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,720
Six nine.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,370
Two.

60
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,450
Come on, let me mention height for you.

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,730
Nine.

62
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:48,990
Two.

63
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,800
So this is the thing which is blackout thing.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,160
Which is.

65
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,070
I'm going to create then.

66
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,290
Drawing.

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:03:59,990
Matt.

68
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,490
Matt also thinks I'm going to create a map draw, draw, I'm going to create.

69
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,880
And that's a function with another thing.

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,070
So we will create that later.

71
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,150
But.

72
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,000
Which is basically graphics 2D, which is a W thing, graphics 2D with G.

73
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,890
And that's it.

74
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,160
We will create my little pod.

75
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:31,280
So that map things, my paintings get map and set map things we are going to create later then borders.

76
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
Let us mention border dot set color.

77
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,980
And for the border.

78
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,360
Or let us.

79
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,940
Let me mention colored art.

80
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:42,720
Yellow.

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,120
So there are default things you can use or you can use hexadecimal codes for your purpose also.

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,190
That's all what I'm using here.

83
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,550
My reaction is again simple zero zero comma 3592.

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,430
So these are the border things I'm going to do and.

85
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,460
Let me copy this part again and again.

86
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,480
And let me mention what I'm going to do is I'm just going to change some parts for lower and higher

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,780
parts.

88
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,340
So let me say.

89
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,500
So this will be the side part.

90
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,020
692 while deploying this you will understand what these these things I'm going to mention zero then

91
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,070
three and five.

92
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,970
And so this is the purpose part.

93
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:38,320
But these things are acting as the lower borders of my circle, which is avoiding to get that ball out

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,090
of that function.

95
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,820
Now.

96
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,570
Let me mention scores for scoring purposes here.

97
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,770
G dot set color again.

98
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,740
Let me mention here.

99
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,330
Wait.

100
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,970
Let us check whether that is right or not.

101
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,700
So you can check your like there are different colors also.

102
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,280
So let me mention here white as it is.

103
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,370
Then let me mention dot set font because font is very important here.

104
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:17,700
Font in this point I'm mentioning serif, which is very common for and it's system enabled.

105
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,870
So no need to.

106
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,580
Work with this font.

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,770
Dot bold.

108
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,770
And let me mention this.

109
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,940
This 25.

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,350
And let me mention one thing here.

111
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,470
I created these things, but I forgot to create a new font method.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,970
So.

113
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,780
Okay.

114
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,660
So this will now act as a fun thing.

115
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,040
And I need to mention one thing.

116
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,630
I forgot one thing, drawstring, which is just not deploying anything.

117
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,080
So.

118
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,510
Instead of graphics 2d animation.

119
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,360
Drawstrings directly at.

120
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,360
With two, 3 to 4 things.

121
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,500
So these things.

122
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:15,430
Interior part plus course I'm going to mention your score and let me mention for you.

123
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,250
Mine become a third of their assets.

124
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,800
So this will act as a store scores.

125
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,920
Now let us create two or three things here.

126
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,820
One is paddle and another is ball.

127
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,720
Because I created models and everything, but I haven't created any paddle or ball things.

128
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,670
So we will create that.

129
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,980
For paddle paddle design.

130
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm going to great now.

131
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,460
Paddle is basically that basic or.

132
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,810
Stage four jumping the ball purpose so that sit.

133
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,490
CALLER And for this, I'm going to set colorize.

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,290
Color dot green so you can check your different things.

135
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,670
So.

136
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,410
GREENE I'm going to mention.

137
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,010
GREENE.

138
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,440
And God.

139
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,400
Again.

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:18,440
Rick Stengel, I need to mention now, what is these things player x which is default things, which

141
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:27,950
is our player that paddle I'm going to move so that's a player and now the ball design and need to mention.

142
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,380
So now again I'm going to mention.

143
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,590
Your local only football and get dot.

144
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,810
Now that's a rectangle.

145
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,840
Now, I need to mention one thing here.

146
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,160
So I mention one thing, then position.

147
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,720
I need to mention ball position.

148
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,620
X comma.

149
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,760
Ball position.

150
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,580
Position.

151
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,130
Why?

152
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,390
Omar 20 over 20.

153
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,530
So that's a height and width, height and width of these things.

154
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,520
And then we will create two or three things later, which is when you win a game, the total breaks

155
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,410
and the basic logic behind this, we will see in our next part.

156
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,850
Hope you understand.

157
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,200
Thank you for this.
