00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.890
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.920
So till the last part, we have organized everything inside the frame.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.210
We have decided panels for the show pane and the display panel.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.780
And also we have added buttons to the footer.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.010
We have added a text field which is going to contain the part of the folder which is opened right now.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.080
We have talked about this counter which is going to count the number of folders.

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.050
We have added our icon also to this elements counter and we have talked about the three hierarchy thing.

8
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:44.820
So till the last part, we have discussed that how we are going to add all the buttons to the footer

9
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.310
panel, how this three expansion listener is working, and how they are adding and removing children.

10
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.640
Accordingly, we are adding a new file folder.

11
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.420
So yes, this was all about the three expansion thing.

12
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.290
We have added a three scroll scroll pane which is going to like scroll through that three this.

13
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.940
So this is the tree structure in the show panel and we can also scroll through the tree and its roots

14
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.480
and children's and everything now coming to the action lesson and part.

15
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.570
So we have like covered all the hierarchy and the tree structure.

16
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.850
Now after adding the buttons to the footer, we have to attach action, not also whether it is the return

17
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.360
button in the header or the save rename and new file and new folder button in the footer.

18
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.610
So this is the action list for the return button which will like navigate us to the previous window

19
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.720
which was open.

20
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.460
So return button that action add listener.

21
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.750
So add action is not is the name of the function.

22
00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.860
We have passed a new action listener as the argument and in order to implement this action listener

23
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:10.350
to this file browser class head, we have implemented we we have to use this override keyword as we

24
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.510
are all like implementing this action listener to our already existing class.

25
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.900
So this is the rule to use this override keyword.

26
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.630
Okay.

27
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.310
So inside this we have like a public void action performed function and we have passed the argument

28
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.630
inside this function.

29
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.790
So it is basically checking that if current folder is not equal to null and it means that we have to

30
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.110
make both of the things true in order to like make this if statement like working.

31
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.570
So yes, if we want to this statement to come in action, then both of these statements should be true.

32
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.290
The current folder should like not equal to null.

33
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.760
And we are we should not be inside any of the folder so that we can press on the return button and we

34
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.420
will be back to the parent of that folder.

35
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.500
So suppose if we open this pain folder and then we click the return button, then we will come back

36
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.050
to the parent folder, which is the painful.

37
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.460
So this is how this return button is working.

38
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.440
And if this is statement is not taking place, then the selected folder should store our value null.

39
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.970
So this is all working on the selected folder thing.

40
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.670
If a folder is selected then the return button will work, otherwise it won't move.

41
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.590
So this is how the return button is like taking an action.

42
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.130
Now the next thing we are going to take like action listener.

43
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.230
The next thing we are going to add action is for the rename file button.

44
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.690
So here we have the rename file button.

45
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.740
So we will be adding action listener for the rename file button.

46
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.390
So creating a.

47
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.240
New action is not okay.

48
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:13.240
So let us start creating action if not for the add folder button as it is the main concern of this project.

49
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:21.010
We want to create a folder in order to make files inside it and rename the files inside it.

50
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:28.000
So yes, so we can call it as the one of the most important buttons we have added to the folder.

51
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.320
So add folder button and action listener.

52
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.890
So here it is.

53
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.210
And inside that action listener, we have to add argument as action listener, new action listener we

54
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.140
can call it.

55
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.700
And yes, this is how this method is created.

56
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.480
Now, inside this, we will be.

57
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.880
So we have to add a brace.

58
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.720
And inside this again override key.

59
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.260
So similarly public void as we have created for the return button.

60
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.270
Public void action performed.

61
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.470
So this is the public void action performed function we have created which is similar to this return

62
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.000
button action listener.

63
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.540
This is the add folder button action listener and in this similar way we have created action performed

64
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.990
function which is going to like the option pane will appear on the screen asking for a name for the

65
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.680
like folder which we want to create like this.

66
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.150
So head.

67
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.260
You can see that this option pane is a pairing asking for enter the name of the new folder.

68
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:49.770
So this is done with the help of this g option paint component of the swing library input dialog when

69
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.440
shown.

70
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:59.590
So inside the frame there will be a question like asking for the name for the folder, and if the name

71
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:07.690
of the folder is not null, then we have to like add that folder to our current three hierarchy.

72
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.370
So we have to open that newly created folder.

73
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.270
We have created the folder in the working of the application part.

74
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.130
So suppose we are creating a folder inside this file browser folder.

75
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:28.960
Then that new folder will be created once we enter the name and hit on this okay button and the new

76
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.400
folder will start padding inside the file browser directory.

77
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.300
So yes, this is how a new folder is created.

78
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.660
And if this if statement is like a working, then this thing will happen.

79
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:52.630
Otherwise, if the loop does like the function does not enter inside this f like statement, the name

80
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.160
of the folder is null.

81
00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:04.300
Then we have to like save selected folder to not like the selected folder object is set to null if the

82
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.290
input field is not entered with any name now in this similar way.

83
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.270
Okay, so I'm going going to copy the same part of the code for the ad file.

84
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.800
Things are going to be similar in the case of add file also.

85
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.180
So inside that file we have to add the add file button.

86
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.640
Adoption business, new action listener again override function.

87
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.600
And inside this same arguments are going to be passed.

88
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.550
So yes, in the next part.

89
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.510
Okay.

90
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:44.500
So we have to update the option pane, which is appearing in the form of import dialog to enter the

91
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.380
name of the new file dot.

92
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:54.640
So the heading will contain this that enter the name of the file and automatically the text will be

93
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.770
attached to the file ahead.

94
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.900
You can see that the new file is created in the form of MC directories.

95
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:10.270
So in the folders we were creating directories, but in the file we are creating a file inside the folder

96
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:17.950
which is inside which we are working and our name of the file will be created with dot text.

97
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.460
So basically it is a string concatenation method.

98
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:28.930
The name of the file will be concatenated with this dot txt and the file will be named to ABC.

99
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.900
Suppose if the name is set to ABC.

100
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:32.470
Okay.

101
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:41.140
So that slight difference between the add folder and the file button is if we are creating a file then

102
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.590
okay.

103
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.740
So same thing will be checked that the name should not be null.

104
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.240
Then only inside this if statement the operation will take place.

105
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.920
So yes, current folder.

106
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.680
So we have to set a path for that file.

107
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:59.800
So if we are writing a file inside this application, then there should be a path.

108
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.960
So suppose it is in the right file browser and then name of that file supports file.

109
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:11.560
So that path should appear on the right frame.

110
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.710
Suppose we are writing anything inside that file.

111
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:21.850
So yes, we have checked that text editor thing inside the working of the application or the path was

112
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.630
appearing here.

113
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:30.670
So this was all about the add file button, how this action is not it is attached to that add file button

114
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.510
and inside the if statement these things are done.

115
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:40.720
And in the statement we are checking that the selected folder is null or not.

116
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:47.110
So if it is null, then we will be creating the new file in this manner and otherwise it is.

117
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:54.940
If it is already containing some folders or files, then we have to change the current folder variable

118
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.320
to the selected folder.

119
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.060
We have to update the folder.

120
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.510
With the newly created file.

121
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.660
So, yes, this is how our ad file button was working.

122
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.880
Now, the next button in the series is daddy name file button.

123
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:16.050
Here you can see that we have covered this new folder, this new file.

124
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:23.280
Now we are here with the new folder like rename button how action should be attached to this rename

125
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:23.910
button.

126
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:31.500
We have tried renaming a folder or a file already like we have tried to rename the file.

127
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.840
TXT We have encountered this in the working of the application part.

128
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:45.570
We renamed the file to a j like check file dot txt and the rename was working perfectly fine.

129
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.730
There are two ways to rename.

130
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:55.500
We can rename the just now created files and folder and we can also rename the already existing files

131
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.690
and folders in our system.

132
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:05.250
So that rename function should be written in such a manner that it should like rename all of the existing

133
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.230
file or the newly created files.

134
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.150
So this is how it is done.

135
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.080
Public void action performed in the similar way for all the above buttons.

136
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:21.270
Okay, so inside this we have to like a set of option pane which will ask for enter the new name and

137
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.490
if a name file is not null.

138
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:31.020
So if we have entered a valid name to that like whatever file folder we want to rename and it should

139
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.930
not null, then we can rename that folder or file whatever it is.

140
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.260
So suppose if it is a folder then how it is done.

141
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.760
So selected folder should like updated to the new name.

142
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.100
The path should get that.

143
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.170
What is the parent of this folder?

144
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.220
And then the new name of the file should be added to that path.

145
00:11:53.220 --> 00:12:01.350
And if the file is directly so, if this is true the file we want to update the file, then what should

146
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.890
be the renaming like be done in the form of.

147
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:13.460
So I if I want to rename a file so only the name part of that specific file should be renamed and dot

148
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.360
txt will remain the same.

149
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.810
We have already tried to rename the file like test dot txt in our working part.

150
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:29.550
We tried to rename it as a check file so that was like remaining unaffected.

151
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.220
Only the name of the file was changing.

152
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.420
So yes.

153
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.430
And also the name should be updated in the like tree hierarchy.

154
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:46.110
Suppose if we want to rename this folder, then that should also update in this like tree cell renderer.

155
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.840
So this hierarchy should also update.

156
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:55.650
Okay, so this was all about the rename file button and coming to the save file button.

157
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.070
So this is simply saving the file.

158
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.630
Suppose we are like writing something inside a file.

159
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.720
So basically we are talking about text editor.

160
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:15.630
We tried to edit some text inside our application window only and on hitting the save button, the like

161
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.800
edited text is saved in the form of a text file.

162
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.840
So the save button.

163
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:28.860
In the similar way we have added action perform function arguments as passed and if that file exist.

164
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:34.410
So suppose the file which we are changing is existing right now, not deleted.

165
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.520
Then we will try.

166
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.450
And so the exception is also there.

167
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:44.820
We have to catch that exception that some text is written in the text area.

168
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:51.660
So suppose a text file is opened in this frame, that display panel, we can say that and we have written

169
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.890
some text to it.

170
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:59.700
Basically it should not be null and then we will hit on this same button, then that file will be saved

171
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.680
with the modified text we have like just now changed it to.

172
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:11.310
And this try block should catch all the text or text on the text area and save that file in that updated

173
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.670
manner.

174
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:20.100
Otherwise, if there is any kind of input output exception we have entered like the text area is null

175
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:28.140
or any kind of input output exception, then this catch block will catch that exception and show error

176
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:35.460
whenever we hit on the save button and things won't be saved as there is some kind of exception.

177
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:43.440
So this was all about all the four buttons we have created this four buttons added them to the panel,

178
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.520
the footer panel.

179
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.700
We have also attached actions list to all four of them save, rename, new file and new folder.

180
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.150
And now coming to this school.

181
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.590
So what is this?

182
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.660
There is a scroll bar here.

183
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.920
We are expanding this.

184
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:06.590
We have already encountered this, that on expanding this, these two panels like change their size

185
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.200
in a relative manner.

186
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:14.420
So if we increase this, this part is decreasing and this is how this is working.

187
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:23.180
So basically application means to show a specific information, whether it be the data or the image

188
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.730
of the selected location.

189
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:33.590
So we have a vertical scrollbar also on scrolling the vertical scroller or whether the horizontal one

190
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.120
there are two splits.

191
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.850
So on scrolling this the data, so suppose it is now currently containing all of them.

192
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:49.610
If we scroll, expand this and see then all the data from the show pane will be displayed on the viewport.

193
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:54.740
So this is how we are like covering this affected scroll thing.

194
00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:01.400
This certificate scroll thing is all about the scroller head working, whether it is the horizontal

195
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.440
split or the vertical split.

196
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:11.120
So yes, this we have added add closeness to the frame and all the keys are working in that.
