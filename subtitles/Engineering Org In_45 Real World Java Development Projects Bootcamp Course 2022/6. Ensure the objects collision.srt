1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:08,920
So now the jetpack coalition pilot can collide with a wall or with a common object or with another baggage.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,310
The baggage can be moved only if it collides with a circle and does not collide with another package

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,030
or a wall.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:23,760
So when the packages move, it will be time to check if the level is completed or not.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,530
So we will check it by calling our matter which we have created is completed method.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,810
So here I will write some switch cases here.

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,810
So take switch to the variable type here.

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,940
Under this.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,860
Start with the left coalition here.

10
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,650
Or for loop first hand I will take for.

11
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,290
Canada's first have to start.

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,620
Okay.

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,260
So we will start with the equal to zero here and I should be less than two.

14
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,610
Back start.

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:33,470
Price and I should be plus, plus and no need to take the package back to

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,360
my start site.

17
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,000
We need to get you the next.

18
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,900
It will check if so-called dirt is left.

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,860
Okay.

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,090
New snapped coalition.

21
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,710
You're not collusion on the parameter to the bag here.

22
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,050
I know this.

23
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:30,970
No dual use, so I need to give another for loop with the eight variable in the g equal to zero and

24
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:39,520
J should be less than with the back start size here and G will be incremented.

25
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,540
Now what can we do?

26
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:50,650
We will take back each item and just say two bags.

27
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,480
Now get.

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,260
G next here now we will take.

29
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,110
And if condition.

30
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,670
Okay.

31
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:10,990
So here I will write if back is left coalition.

32
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:20,510
So get the parameter to the item here and just simply return true here.

33
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:29,630
And top of this need to check one condition.

34
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,430
Give the back and type not.

35
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,290
Okay here I will kill the left coalition.

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,260
Left coalition here.

37
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,530
Just simply return.

38
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,190
True.

39
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,540
What does this look?

40
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,090
Okay, we have the.

41
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,270
We have got to back.

42
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,960
Okay.

43
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,240
Just simply we have to remove this first.

44
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,800
We?

45
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:37,970
Before that, we have to check with another coalition if back door equals item or not.

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,890
Under that, we will define this.

47
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,850
We?

48
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,950
Now, I'll start here.

49
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,030
Just.

50
00:04:51,400 --> 00:05:03,010
Simply caught this beast here and it simply goes, okay, now we have to move our back.

51
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,060
Simply, we will right back.

52
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,500
Move with the minus space variable we need.

53
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,690
We need the space variable here, comma zero.

54
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,730
And we will call the completed matter here.

55
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,670
Okay.

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,250
So what else?

57
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,400
After that, we will return.

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,210
True?

59
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,220
No, we have to return.

60
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,060
False.

61
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,220
No.

62
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,950
Same thing which we have to do.

63
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,860
We will do with the case.

64
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,310
Right.

65
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,310
Collision.

66
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,750
So here I will try to write Coalition.

67
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,720
Same condition is here.

68
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,730
We need to check for the four.

69
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,640
And I is equal to zero.

70
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:11,220
I should be less than two back start size and I should be plus plus out of which we will take the baggage

71
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:25,710
bag is equal to bag store get I index and next we will check if so-called not is right coalition.

72
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,790
Here.

73
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,870
You get the argument of bank here for what it will do.

74
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:47,310
It will create an inter for loop here because a baggage can collide with a wall or of an object or another

75
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,860
object also means the baggage.

76
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:56,340
So the baggage can move only if it collides with the one and it does not collide with another baggage

77
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,090
on a wall.

78
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,600
So here, what we can do,

79
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,990
we will write.

80
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,480
We have the right collision here.

81
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,240
Okay.

82
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,960
We have derived what we have done in the previous year.

83
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,170
Okay.

84
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,950
So,

85
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,170
okay, so cool.

86
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,400
Do try it.

87
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:30,770
Okay.

88
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:39,550
So we need to take and in the loop here with the chart variable which will be equal to zero and g should

89
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,140
be less than two backs.

90
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,510
Not size here.

91
00:07:44,910 --> 00:08:02,030
My exercise and simply C++ on which we will take the package item is equal to bag start get at index.

92
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,530
Now here we will take if is not the bad dot equals.

93
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,320
Yeah.

94
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:21,300
I don't want it simply it will check with the bag is right collected or not.

95
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,190
So here I will write if.

96
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,480
Back.

97
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,690
Lord is right.

98
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,180
Coalition here.

99
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,160
Give the parameter with the item

100
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,430
and simply return true?

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,680
No.

102
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,500
Here.

103
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,320
After that it will check for the calculation also.

104
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:03,510
So go with the moral coalition and give the argument with the bad and simply the right coalition.

105
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,850
And a notice it will return.

106
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,580
True?

107
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,910
No.

108
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,270
We have to move our bag also.

109
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,570
So here I will give the space.

110
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,370
Comma zero here.

111
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,180
And.

112
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:31,720
Also we have to check the level is completed by calling the is completed material.

113
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,330
Who is completed matter.

114
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,260
Okay.

115
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,480
So we have done.

116
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,810
And after that, we have to return.

117
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,800
False.

118
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,260
Same thing.

119
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,830
Here it goes with the top and the bottom coalition to.

120
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,990
So next thing which we have to do is we have to complete our is completed matter.

121
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,390
And these are the top and the bottom.
