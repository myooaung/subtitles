1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,500
What I'm on here.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,570
We can work till five Canadian dollar to the euro and we go down to 3.45 here.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:17,160
So what we have done and the last thing and it's still fluid here, we have automatic string to the

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,470
floor and it's going to be total convert.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,120
So we have this here, the total convert.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,410
Okay.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,290
So the result is split time.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:33,810
That's the set text that's trailing time and that it's going to see current trade that day and that

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,330
we are going to do match and find that group one, the first group of the result.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,920
That's basically it.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,840
We have the whole application here.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:52,080
This is the result and we can here we have done this thing and after thing what we have done, we can

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,660
import export our project also.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,870
So here I have done this export.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,040
So here we have caught our attention.

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,070
This is John here.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,640
The school.

18
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,190
Okay.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,230
Not good here.

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,270
We got our converter API.

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,740
We.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,850
Here we are to our class.
