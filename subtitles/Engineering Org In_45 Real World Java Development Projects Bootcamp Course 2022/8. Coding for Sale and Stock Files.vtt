00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.940
So in this video, we will talk about the two files, last two files of this project.

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.160
Those are sealed on Java and show stock Java files so sealed on Java file will be used to restore the

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.210
OR fetch the information of any sale of the product.

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.290
And while show a stock about Java file will be used to show the stocks which are there in our database.

5
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.450
So the first file or Java file is stored.

6
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.250
Define inside the package store.

7
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.920
And we have imported the necessary packages here.

8
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.110
Import Java x when j panel j table j radio button action not and ArrayList.

9
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.480
Then we have imported Java Swing Combo Box G Label Text Field swing j table.

10
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.590
Default Table model.

11
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.980
After that, we have defined our class public sale extending panel inside the class we have initialized

12
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.460
the.

13
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.020
Sale variable of vegetable type.

14
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.390
Then there is a text field variable of date type.

15
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.150
After that, there is a combo box or.

16
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.860
Name this combo.

17
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.550
Com.

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.170
And there is a string comma and then there is a static default table model that is DTM which will help

19
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.610
us to model our table.

20
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.510
And then we have a ArrayList of a string type named as print.

21
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.200
After that, we have defined the.

22
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.350
Non parameter as constructor of the class.

23
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.720
Set the layout of the frame.

24
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.910
After that, inside is string named as other area.

25
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.500
We have defined date, product, company and sale.

26
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.750
After that, we have defined the.

27
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.830
Before the table model object to header comma zero pass that header.

28
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.710
So that will create the header for the default table model.

29
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.350
After that we have initialize the sale instance by passing new table, a new table and data table model

30
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.830
in that argument.

31
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.470
Then we have set the bound for that table at that table to our frame.

32
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.280
After that, we have defined a scroll panel over the table so that if there are multiple records in

33
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.800
that table, so that can be scrollable vertically.

34
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.670
So that why we have defined here a scroll scroll pane which will help us to scroll over those records.

35
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:48.110
Then we have set the bound for those that panel 244 comma 69 is its position and 494 cross 379 that

36
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.920
will be its size.

37
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.570
Adding that panel to our.

38
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.650
Frame the scroll panel to our frame.

39
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.590
After that, we have defined the radio button.

40
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.540
DS That is a daily sale.

41
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.220
So there is will be the radio button to check for the sale.

42
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.890
Either the sale you want to show daily sales or you want to check for the monthly sale.

43
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.870
So for that we have a radio buttons here.

44
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.040
First is daily sale.

45
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.560
For that we have set the font, its font, family font type and font size.

46
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.860
After that, we have set us bound X and y locations like 62 comma.

47
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.090
69 will be its location and its size will be 109 across 23.

48
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.680
Then we have added that little button to our frame and distorts that selected as true.

49
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.430
So the initial selection or the default selection will be of daily.

50
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.120
You can either change it to the monthly cell as well.

51
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.370
After that, we have defined another radio button as monthly cell, said the font for it font, family

52
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.900
font size and font type.

53
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.730
Then we have set bound for that.

54
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.540
A radio button.

55
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.370
So its position will be 62, one, one, two and its size will be 144 cross 23, then adding that radio

56
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.490
button to a frame.

57
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.290
After that, we have defined a label labeled as date and then we have defined the font for that label.

58
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.990
And the font family is the home font type is plain and font size is 18 setting its bounds, its location

59
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.670
will be 62, 178.

60
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.630
And it's.

61
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.660
Size will be 75.

62
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.680
Cross 14.

63
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.540
Adding that label to our frame or panel.

64
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.240
Then we have defined a date which is a text field setting bound for it with location 62, comma one,

65
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.580
nine nine and sizes 86, cross 20.

66
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.710
Adding that date to our panel or frame after that, we have defined the label for the format of the

67
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.230
date, setting it bounds and adding that to our frame.

68
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.240
After that, we have defined the button load.

69
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.150
This button load will add the or load the.

70
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.340
Table.

71
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.160
So this is the button over which we have defined the action listener and we have performed.

72
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.760
The action performed.

73
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.370
We have defined the action performed method inside which we have passed the action event object.

74
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.470
After that, we have installed the date from the date label inside our date variable and the company

75
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.070
from the selected item inside our comp variable.

76
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.010
Then if the DZ is selected, so if the start is selected, it will be true.

77
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.480
Then we will call daily sales.

78
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.350
So if the daily sale is selected, then we will call daily sale method.

79
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.190
Either if monthly set is selected, then we will call the monthly sell method.

80
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.310
After that, we have set the bound for that button and added that button to our frame.

81
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.590
Then we have defined a J label LBL company named as company set its font and then we have set bound

82
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.620
for it so its size and location can be decided.

83
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.210
Added that label to our frame.

84
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.980
After that, we have defined the box named as comp setting its bound so that its location and size can

85
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.700
be decided.

86
00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.160
Adding that to our panel or frame after that we have added item or that comp box.

87
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.650
First is all, second is General Matt and Rux, and fourth is NCE or electric.

88
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.000
These are will be the types of companies after that over there's all those.

89
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.510
GMs.

90
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.690
So GMs is.

91
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.600
Yes, as is the radio, but a monthly sale.

92
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.860
So for the monthly sales event we have defined the action perform the event which is taking an action

93
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.230
event named as RG RG zero.

94
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.930
So we have defined the start selected false.

95
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:39.030
So if monthly or monthly selected will be monthly sale will be selected, then daily sale visibility

96
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.920
should set to false and.

97
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.160
If Daily Sale is selected.

98
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.710
So monthly cell selectivity should be.

99
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.340
Also, these are the two listeners for the daily sale and monthly sale.

100
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:57.030
After that, we have defined the daily sale method which is taking argument and com inside which we

101
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.580
have defined ArrayList of a string as one and as one is storing the DB to get sale.

102
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:08.790
So as one ArrayList will restore the information which will be returned by the method of the sale of

103
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.010
our DB class, which is taking argument of a string and a string company.

104
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.080
After that we have defined for string x one, x two and three.

105
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.160
Now in data table model we have set row count to zero.

106
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.680
After that, end size will be taking as one size, so the size of the array list will be divided by

107
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.060
four because.

108
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.620
There will be four columns, so the records must be divided by four so that we can understand the number

109
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.310
of columns.

110
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:40.060
And for that number of rows, we have iterated over this slope from zero to less than size of that.

111
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.980
And after that in x1x2x3x4, we have stored the respective.

112
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:55.140
Values of from the SE one is string value which will is storing the returned values from the get sale

113
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.700
so that in x1x23x4 all the values will be stored after that.

114
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:05.340
In the data table model we will add row with the new object array and the object array will contains

115
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:11.310
the elements x one, x, two, x three and x four, which we have just fetched from our DB or get sell

116
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.390
method after that if public static for void monthly sale.

117
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:21.360
So we will be selecting a date by date or split slash so that it will be split display split the date

118
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.670
on the basis of the slash space character.

119
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.730
And then we have defined the string over the dates, one, two, three, four that will contain dates

120
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.880
till 31.

121
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.670
Then there's is a list of a string, a string entity.

122
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.950
Then we have set the count to zero.

123
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.200
After that we have iterated from 1 to 31 or.

124
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.510
And set the entity and date to date zero one and two one.

125
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.680
So date zero and one.

126
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.910
So zero will be a containing day and one will be containing month.

127
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.790
And after that we have added sex doctrine.

128
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.990
So as to trim.

129
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.530
Well, trim these values.

130
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.780
So for one, it will have zero one.

131
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.130
So if there is any space to trim will be removed.

132
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.920
Those spaces after that as one will store the get sale from end to end.

133
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.830
Com so as when will be storing the return values from this method.

134
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.380
After that there is a similarly for strings again.

135
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:23.220
So dividing the size of s one by four so that we can count the number of those and install the data

136
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.780
on this respective values.

137
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.460
After that, we have added the data table model, added the row over the new object area for x1x2,

138
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.090
xx3 and x four.

139
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.020
So this is all about the sale or java file.

140
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.190
And now.

141
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.120
Let's check the show Stalked Java file.

142
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.190
So this file is also stored inside the package store.

143
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.640
We have imported the necessary packages here.

144
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:53.510
After that, we have defined the source top class, which is extending panel, having a table as a stock

145
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.630
table and a common box named as company in the default table.

146
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.540
Model as model.

147
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.030
Then we have defined the.

148
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.580
Non parameterized constructor, setting the layout as null.

149
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.090
After that we have set the boundaries and red command red entered sizes eight 4619.

150
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:13.180
Then we have defined the label labeled as available stock setting its bound and font.

151
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.190
After that, we have added that label to our.

152
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.310
Three more panel, then we have to find another.

153
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:26.710
Before table model object and then we have defined the table and pass that default table model into

154
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.180
that table named as a stock table setting bound for the stock table and adding that stock table to our

155
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:31.700
frame.

156
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.280
After that, we have added.

157
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:41.480
Column for the for our model table product ID, product detail, company and quantity.

158
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.970
These will be the columns to show stock.

159
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.440
After that, we have added a scroll panel for our table.

160
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.230
Then we inside the company combo box, we initialize the company its background color and set the bound

161
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.460
for that company combo box.

162
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.800
Added that company combo box in our framework panel.

163
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.810
After that, we have defined the items of that company all general manager index and as an electric.

164
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.370
These will be the types of the company.

165
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.780
Then we have defined the action item is not for the company and if the item is changed change then we

166
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.840
will update the table by calling update table method.

167
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.970
After that, we have defined the label labeled as company and setting its bounds and adding that to

168
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:17.630
our frame.

169
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.910
Then this is of no use.

170
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.080
Now let me remove it.

171
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.130
Yes.

172
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.670
After that button refresh, this will be used for the refresh.

173
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.370
So adding action listener to is and it will also update the table by using the update table method,

174
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.950
setting the bound for that button and adding that button to our table.

175
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.410
And at last we can update we will update table again.

176
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.630
Now here is the update table.

177
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:45.760
What is the update table method is doing that it is setting the count initially as zero.

178
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:50.770
After that there is a string ArrayList of a string name that is stock now a stock that is stored the.

179
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:59.860
Returning values of the method debate shows talk which is taking argument as comp or get selected items

180
00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:00.610
or string.

181
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:07.030
So this will be selected for the type of the company and converting it to a string and pass the argument

182
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.170
to the debate or to stock.

183
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:15.940
After that, we have iterated over the stock size of the value and then we have added those values or

184
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.630
whatever.

185
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.340
Table by add row method.

186
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.090
And these values will be added from the stock ArrayList.

187
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.460
So this is all about the.

188
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.430
These two glass glasses of our project.

189
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.370
So this is a stock choice stock dot java.

190
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:38.950
And previously we have learned about the sale or Java file and implementation and line by line explanation

191
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:39.490
of this.

192
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.510
So.

193
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.640
Our explanation of the files have been completed.

194
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.730
In next video we will be showing and having a look at the complete run live run of this project.

195
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.170
So that's all in this video.
