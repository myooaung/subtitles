1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:00,830
Okay.

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:07,660
So till the last part, we have covered everything about the actual listeners to the buttons save rename

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,120
new new folder on the back button.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,720
And also we have covered how this tree hierarchy is changing itself whenever there is update.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,450
So we were discussing about this scroll, so how this affects scrolling working.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:30,220
So suppose if we expand this so this like we can say that as a vertical split between these two panels

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:37,360
and this will show the information on the viewport, the names of the folders or these, and it will

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,540
be adjusted self accordingly.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,160
So we have like setting the size accordingly, the new dimensions.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,390
Whenever we scroll the show panel to the longer space, then it will readjust its size accordingly.

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,750
And we have set opaque to force as it is going to be a translucent window.

12
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,540
The background is currently visible.

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,210
We can see that the background is visible from these folders blocks.

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,220
It is basically a grid layout.

15
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,780
All the folders are containing inside this in the form of a grid layout.

16
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,660
And this is how the scroller was working.

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,970
Now coming to the attic listener.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,590
So we are adding carelessness to the application.

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:31,600
We are adding some of the shortcuts for like if we want to make that return button work, a keyboard

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
shortcut is attached.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,780
So here is the return button.

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,460
So suppose you want to do this with the help of keyboard and not with the mouse.

23
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,400
Then there are shortcuts for all of them.

24
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,600
So here you can see that for written button we are using the backspace.

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,560
Okay.

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:54,030
So for add folder button we are using control and we can press control and from the keyboard and now

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,540
we can create a new folder.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,560
Or similarly for renaming we can press controller and new of all new files.

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:08,530
A new folder will be created with the help of control and our renaming will take place with the help

30
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,370
of controller.

31
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:16,140
Similarly with the backspace or the back button will be enabled with Turkey listeners.

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,670
So we have added Krsna function in order to do so and frame validate is called here.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,050
So what this frame validate is.

34
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:32,260
So suppose we are taking like making actions with the help of carelessness.

35
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,590
So the frame should also be updated accordingly.

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,010
Suppose we are creating a new folder with the help of the keyboard.

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,230
Then the folder structure should also be updated in that manner.

38
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,500
So for that we are using this validate.

39
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,850
So whatever changes taking place should be validated to this hierarchy which is already present.

40
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,820
So the new folder which is being added or whether we are renaming any folder or file, then it should

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,940
be updated here in the tree hierarchy directory.

42
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,200
So to keeping all the things in mind, we are adding functions accordingly, whether it be the key listener

43
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,850
or the mouse motion listener.

44
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:22,000
And also we are setting this frame to set visible to true as by default it is false now coming to the

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,140
paint component.

46
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,470
So what this paint component is actually doing.

47
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:34,960
So this paint component is actually taking care of how things are going to be look on the frame.

48
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,860
So here you can see that we are having a background image for the display panel, a background image

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,660
for the show panel.

50
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,040
Also, the things are appearing in a non opaque manner.

51
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,190
The background is visible from behind the folders.

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,310
There are blocks.

53
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,920
Folders are like presented in the form of a blocks layout.

54
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,450
So this paint component is taking care of all the graphics which are on the frame.

55
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,160
So here we have to draw, draw, image, function.

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,400
So this is stored for this graphics.

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,240
This graphics is also an import we have made above header.

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,300
You can see that we have imported the graphics from the Java String Library.

59
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:32,320
So here you can see that here we have already imported the graphics and we are using it now.

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,290
So yes, we are using the graphics to set the background for both the panels.

61
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,990
This get the image is getting the image for the show panel.

62
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:51,790
And the second one, the background download page is setting the background for this display panel.

63
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:59,650
So there is some width and height for that background which we have set in the form of graphics and.

64
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,370
We are like repainting it whenever a new folder or file is added or deleted or renamed.

65
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,280
So this background should be repainted.

66
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,290
Repainted is basically updating whenever a change is taking place.

67
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:23,330
So it is a kind of like refreshing the graphics whenever a change is taking place.

68
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,520
So this was all about the paint component function.

69
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,280
Now coming to the open file.

70
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:36,020
So if we have created a file or if there is a already present file, then it should be open.

71
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,790
So how the file is opening, that should be a function for opening the file also.

72
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,370
So this public void open file is responsible for opening the file.

73
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,430
So if file exists.

74
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,110
So suppose we are trying to open a file which is already existing.

75
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,800
Then the show panel should like.

76
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,960
So here is the show panel.

77
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,000
We want to open a file.

78
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,100
Then it should open that file in the display panel side.

79
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:16,430
And if the file is not in the directory, then we can return the tab undetermined, which means that

80
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,680
we are trying to access a file which is not present in the directory.

81
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,960
So if the file type is not null, then that file should be opened here.

82
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:36,450
Whether it is an image in the dot jpg format, whether it is a text file or it is a PDF.

83
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,280
So we should open.

84
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,660
If the file path is not null, there is a valid path for the file which we want to open then.

85
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,140
Okay.

86
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:54,600
So suppose if the file tech file is containing a text file, then a text editor should open in the display

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,890
panel where we can read the file or right in the file.

88
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:07,560
Basically, we can work in the file as a text editor, so we will be creating a read file function also,

89
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,820
which will open that how the read file is going to look inside the frame.

90
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,020
Currently, we are concerned with opening the file only.

91
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,620
So yes, if the file is text, then we can open in the form of a like text editor.

92
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:29,670
If we try to open a pdf, then that pdf should open in the PDF view of the system.

93
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,180
Okay.

94
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,330
So the application is not containing any PDF reader till now.

95
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:41,730
We can also try to add a PDF reader also, but right now it will try to open the PDF in the PDF viewer

96
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,870
of your system.

97
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,800
Similarly, if there is an image which we are trying to open, then it will open the image in the form

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,540
of like display panel.

99
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,580
It will open the image in the form of a white background, and the image will appear on your display

100
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,600
panel side.

101
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:09,570
If that image is supported by this application, if the image is not supported by the system in which

102
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:17,670
you are trying to open, that, then unsupported image will appear on your screen, which will say that

103
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,240
the image you are trying to open is unsupported.

104
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,910
You must have encountered this earlier.

105
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:32,250
Also, if you try to open any corrupted, unsupportable file in your system, then I cannot pass on

106
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,420
your screen saying that this image is unsupported.

107
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,030
So try opening some other image or you can try to redownload the image.

108
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,020
So yes, this was how this open function was working.

109
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,460
Open file function.

110
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,160
It was opening the file in the.

111
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,700
Applications interface.

112
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:01,160
So this statement is taking into consideration that what if the image is not open?

113
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:09,740
So when any file will open in this display panel, then this footer, we can say that will appear below

114
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:18,410
the file, which is open and otherwise, if the statement will like work, then the list of files will

115
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,230
appear in this manner only, and no files will be open and this folder will be attached to it.

116
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,190
So this footer info label will remain the same.

117
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,140
Whether a file is open or not.

118
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,240
We will try to check how things are working when we will run the application.

119
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,070
Okay.

120
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,090
So yes, and the and show pane is basically filling the show pane.

121
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,200
So this is the show panel which is filled right now.

122
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,430
Whenever we try to open a file, it will expand this key.

123
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,820
Suppose we are opening a file from this file browser folder.

124
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,330
So this is how we are filling things inside our show panel here.

125
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:05,720
You can see that for the folders we are having a yellow colored icon for all the folders for the files.

126
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,120
Accordingly, we are having or like basically we can call it as icons.

127
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:17,380
So for the image we are having an image icon and for all the related files they are containing icons

128
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,780
respective to them.

129
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,330
So this is very simple.

130
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:26,590
Shopping is basically for filling the show pane, how the show pane should appear, how the icon should

131
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,360
be attached.

132
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,400
So here you can see that we are having image icon.

133
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:38,470
Suppose if we have an image file so that should contain our image icon which will open the image and

134
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,880
the icon will be in the form of our image only.

135
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,770
Similarly for the folders, the folders icons are appearing in the show panel.

136
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:55,240
So this field shopping is working for the show panel side only that how things should appear.

137
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,160
Basically it is a tree structure.

138
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,320
We have already discussed it and the look is decided in the field panel function, which we are talking

139
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,830
about.

140
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,320
Okay.

141
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,720
So this is about all the size and dimensions of how long they should be expanded to what should be their

142
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,580
height and width and everything.

143
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,000
And this is the dimension for the.

144
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,870
Suppose we made that choice then the dimensions are going to be different.

145
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,750
They should be like slightly shifted towards the right hand.

146
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:33,220
You can see that if we expand any folder then the channel should shift slightly towards the right.

147
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,820
So this is how the show pane is filling, how things are like, adjusting themselves accordingly that

148
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,670
they should appear in a hierarchical manner.

149
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:50,260
There is also a key attached to all the folder and the key is like moving in a diagonal manner whenever

150
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,350
we are traversing through that child of that group.

151
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,210
So that is all about the show panel feeling and now coming to the read file function.

152
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,090
So we have already covered like this, covered the open file function that what should happen when we

153
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,410
try to open a file.

154
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,220
Now suppose we are opening a text file then how it should appear on your display panel.

155
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:21,970
So once we open a text file then it should contain a feature that we can read and write in that text

156
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:29,800
editor we have already like worked how writing and reading work in that text editor So this is the function

157
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,210
for reading and writing.

158
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,910
So for reading, suppose initially it is containing empty text.

159
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:44,170
We can try writing something and with the help of buffer reader buffer, there is a component basically

160
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:51,430
from the String and NWT Library which enables us to read whatever, whatever is present inside the text

161
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,880
file.

162
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:00,520
So yes, if the display panel will support, we are having a 20 line of statement and this is a ten

163
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,380
line of it.

164
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:09,310
Only then it should automatically move it to the next line, the ten lines in ten words in a first row

165
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,800
and the second ten lines in the second row.

166
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:19,360
So basically this is adjusting the content in the text file according to the size of the display panel

167
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,820
and now click.

168
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,160
Okay, so if we close the reader, then we should exit and we'll come back to this folder structure

169
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,660
only.

170
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,920
So yes, this is how it is done, how the editing function is working.

171
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:40,570
We have discussed it and if there is any kind of exception is opening the file, the readable file.

172
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,420
Then our error occurred while reading the stream.

173
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,350
Should be a pair in the form of a string which are like different.

174
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:55,570
Like describe that the file which we are trying to read is like somewhere not able to be open in our

175
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,500
application.

176
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,280
Okay.

177
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,360
So this read file is going to return the number of lines.

178
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,380
It is non, non or non void function.

179
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,420
So something to return.

180
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,990
A function should return something if it is not void.

181
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,610
Okay.

182
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:18,940
So coming to the right file function, we can write something inside the file, we can modify the file

183
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,120
and if there is an empty file which we have just created, then also we can write something on the file

184
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,820
and save that file on hitting the save button.

185
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,790
So yes, this is how the right file function is work.

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,380
So after the reading and writing file function, we are here to creating children to the root.

187
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,460
So suppose we are in our folder which is empty.

188
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,150
So suppose we are in this folder and currently it is empty.

189
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,030
Then we have to create children's to this.

190
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,900
So basically we are creating this in a tree like structure.

191
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,450
So inside this print the subfolders will be created.

192
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,050
Suppose we are trying to create four folders.

193
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,450
Then this will take place with the help of this create children function, which is like we have past

194
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:12,170
default table three node as the argument and definitely they are going to create nodes to that three

195
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,660
three like structure of course.

196
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:22,670
So yes, on creating nodes, the subfolders, maybe they can be folders or they can be files, so they

197
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,470
will be created inside that root, which we have selected for.

198
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,680
So this Create Children is working in that manner.

199
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:38,570
So this for loop is working in a manner to attach new nodes to the already existing folders or files

200
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,950
inside the parent.

201
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,320
And the self statement is returning.

202
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:50,660
Suppose we do not want to add any child then this else block will take into working and no nodes will

203
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,520
be added to that default.

204
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,470
Multiple three node function.
