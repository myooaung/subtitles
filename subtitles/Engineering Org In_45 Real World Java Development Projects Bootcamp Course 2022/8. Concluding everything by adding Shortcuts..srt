1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:08,210
Now so that we have created actions performers for the print and exit button.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,720
Let me explain what this is actually doing.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:21,050
So suppose if your system has a printer attached, then this will try to print the text media and otherwise

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,600
this will catch an exception and show that it is an error.

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:32,330
The printer is not attached to the system, so try connecting a printer first and then try to print

6
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,480
your required text which you have typed for.

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:42,800
Similarly, on clicking on the exit button, there is a simple function system dot exit which takes

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,000
argument as null zero or false, whatever we call it.

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,430
So when we click exit, the system exits with the null exception.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:03,060
Similarly for copy and cart, select and paste, we have in-built functions like for cut.

11
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,550
We have text area shortcut for copy.

12
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,760
Similarly, we have to paste this part only.

13
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,430
Like for copy we have text area.

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,380
Don't copy for paste.

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,010
We have extra dot paste.

16
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,110
An.

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,270
Select all.

18
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:40,630
We have text area not selectable similarly so yes we have done this everything now coming to the about

19
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,010
part what is going to be performed on clicking the about button.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,290
So I'm clicking the about button.

21
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:56,890
A new about window will open which we have created here in the above Java class and the visibility of

22
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,840
this window should be set to true set visible.

23
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,450
Should be true.

24
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,620
Yes.

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,600
So here we are.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,560
Now, let us try and run this.

27
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,650
Notepad dot java, run Java.

28
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,740
And then wait.

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,320
Yes.

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,990
So let us type something.

31
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,840
Hello, everyone.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,760
We are here.

33
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,700
To learn core Java Soyuz.

34
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,890
Now let us try to click on the print button.

35
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,690
Perfect.

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,130
So I'm clinging clicking that print button.

37
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:51,090
A print window opens which asks that which printer you want to print it from and the format of this

38
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,600
print.

39
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,970
Similarly, it has many other options, also number of copies.

40
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:05,730
So the proper printing window is set with the help of this option.

41
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,000
Try and catch and get action.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Command equals ignored print.

43
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:23,760
Similarly on clicking the exit it will exit so the window is closed now running this again and try to

44
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,910
test the cut, copy and other windows buttons like hello.

45
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,790
Now let me try to select this and cut.

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,340
Yes, so it is cut.

47
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,920
Now let us try to paste it.

48
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,510
Hello is pasted.

49
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:52,590
Now select all of the text written here is selected with the help of this select button copy and then

50
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,570
try to paste it again, again and multiple times.

51
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,430
You wish it to be printed.

52
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:08,560
So we have created actual listeners for all the buttons here for the file, edit and help.

53
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:18,220
Now let us try to add some keyboard shortcuts with this button so that we can perform that task with

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,670
the help of keyboard itself while typing.

55
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:27,250
So there will be no need to click on the button, leaving your keyboard and coming to your mouse.

56
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,850
You can do everything with the help of your keyboard only.

57
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,390
So let's start adding the shortcuts.

58
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,710
Yes.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,430
So below this we are going to add the keyboard shortcuts attached with every button in the menu bar.

60
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,840
So for the new file, we are going to set it as set accelerator.

61
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,190
Set accelerator is used for the keyboard shortcuts.

62
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,980
It has an argument as keystroke.

63
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,300
After which call get keystroke.

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,740
Get Keystroke and the required characters.

65
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,620
So key events.

66
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,630
Key events.

67
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,800
And.

68
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,480
After key events.

69
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,590
We have to.

70
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,860
Collector's Dot Vicki her.

71
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,170
We can, as we want control end to be the shortcut of this.

72
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:49,960
So suppose we are writing it as key event dot dot mn and the modifier will be as the event.

73
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,290
Key event control down mask.

74
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,520
The event.

75
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,820
Donald Musk Yes.

76
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:11,890
So we have successfully created a shortcut key for the new file option.

77
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:21,010
Now, let me copy this for all the buttons like we have it earlier, it was one, two, three, four,

78
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,950
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 19.

79
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,460
So pasting it ten more times and replacing for each button.

80
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,550
Again.

81
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,180
Again.

82
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,270
And I think let us try to change open file.

83
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,900
Save file.

84
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,630
Print exit for the print button.

85
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,090
The shortcut will be different for exit button.

86
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,250
The shortcut is a different key from your keyboard shortcut.

87
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,180
Copy.

88
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,790
Based and select all.

89
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,930
So ignore the typos and select all.

90
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,160
Select all.

91
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:28,880
I think we have one more option about so about will also contain a shortcut attached with it.

92
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,820
Now think about some keys from your keyboard, like for opening the file.

93
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,260
It could be.

94
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,480
Or for saving.

95
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,910
It could be as control as for printing.

96
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,010
It could be paid for.

97
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,760
It could be W for exit.

98
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:00,020
Cut should be x and copy should be control c.

99
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,960
Page should be P.

100
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
For selecting all.

101
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,970
We use a.

102
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:16,730
And similarly for the about option, let us suppose we are using the J key on our keyboard.

103
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,720
So yes.

104
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,060
Now let us try to run this and see if we are okay.

105
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:23,900
Okay.

106
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,640
So if we are able to add.

107
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,140
No shortcuts.

108
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:29,860
Yes.

109
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,760
Perfect.

110
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,120
So we are able to add shortcuts with every key.

111
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:42,730
Like for new we have n0s print p exit w similarly for the edit options cut copy paste.

112
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,190
So let us try to check this.

113
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:53,440
Like if I am inputting hello and trying to cut this with the help of my keyboard print typing like it

114
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,450
does control x.

115
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,260
So it should be selected and cut.

116
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,770
So yes, I am able to cut it.

117
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,360
Now let me try to paste this with the help of my keyboard control.

118
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,400
Be so perfect.

119
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,670
The shortcuts are working perfectly fine.

120
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:21,150
Okay, so in the window of the notepad, we can see that there is a not so good double bottom lining.

121
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,650
So let us try to remove this with the help of some functions.

122
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,050
So search for the scroll area which we have created.

123
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,920
And try to add something which could vanish the double lining there.

124
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,450
So, yes.

125
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,150
At this place, I am going to add a scroll pen.

126
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,800
Yes.

127
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,590
Above this line, I'm going to add a scroll pane dot set border.

128
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,280
Said border and the border will be like border factory.

129
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:09,190
Don't create empty border as we do not want any border between the title and the menubar.

130
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,020
So create.

131
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,530
Empty border.

132
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,790
Selecting this.

133
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,990
Now let us try to run this and check if we are able to edit or not run Java.

134
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,580
And yes, the double border is managed.

135
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,360
So the application is almost ready.

136
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,400
One more modification.

137
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,350
I want to do this.

138
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,470
Suppose that we click on Control Open.

139
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,290
Our.

140
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:54,650
I suppose like when the file chooser option opens in the save and open button, this very old design

141
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,340
model of the file chooser opens.

142
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,630
So I want to give it a good look.

143
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,900
A modern file choose chooser should open.

144
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,280
So yes.

145
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,380
So the file chooser you should be involving to the user.

146
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:23,450
So I am going to add a UI manager dot set look and see said look and feel option inside which UI manager

147
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:33,950
again and get system look and feel class name get system look and feel class.

148
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,940
Yes.

149
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,970
So this will throw an exception when there is an error.

150
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,460
So throwing exception.

151
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,390
Yes.

152
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:53,750
So let us go and take a look that the file chooser is still the old one or it is updated running the

153
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,370
notepad java again.

154
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,910
And waiting for it to be executed.

155
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,910
Now let us try to type something.

156
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,640
Random tags and clicking and suppose say so often.

157
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,360
This is the modern trial style which opens and we want it in this way.

158
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,210
Only the old one was not so good and involving for the user.

159
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:33,150
So closing this now as far as I can say that we have covered almost everything in the notepad.

160
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:46,590
So giving this project a conclusion as we have created our about class app app named Notepad and after

161
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,460
which we have added actions to the buttons.

162
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:56,220
We have created menu bar inside the frame using the JWT library.

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:06,450
So overall, this project teaches us all the concepts about a simple Java UI application, and I hope

164
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:16,200
you all are going to make this project on your own and learn these concepts too, not only by viewing

165
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:24,360
this lecture, but making the project by your own is the best way to learn and practice the language

166
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,010
learning process.

167
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:33,900
So I hope you all have enjoyed this series of project and thanking you.

168
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,120
All for joining this.

169
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,040
Goodbye.
