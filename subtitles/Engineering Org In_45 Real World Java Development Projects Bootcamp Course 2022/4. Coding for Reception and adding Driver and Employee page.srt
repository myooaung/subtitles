1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,400
So here is our reception java file.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,660
So.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,520
Let's start explaining it.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,840
So package hotel, it is defined inside the package hotel inside which all the classes and Java files

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,890
have been defined.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,990
We imported the Java String package as SQL Package eight Event Package and Abstract Window Toolkit Package

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,060
to provide a graphical user interface for this window, we have defined the class reception, which

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,830
is extending the frame initialized panel named as content pane, which is a private instance variable

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,670
of this class.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,730
Inside the main method, we have initialized the object of the current class as new reception.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,160
Then we have defined a non parameterized constructor named as the same the class name reception setting

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
the bound for the frame.

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:08,380
Initializing the new panel setting, setting the content pane, setting the panel into the frame and

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,140
setting the layout of the panel as null.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,140
Then we will creating an image icon, then adding the image icon to the object of image.

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,470
Adding the image again into that another image icon object and adding that image icon into the.

17
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,330
Jailable.

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,030
Setting the tone for the label and adding that label to the frame.

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,310
Now here is the button object variable named as button.

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,430
New Customer Forum Label as new customer form.

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,610
Adding the action listener to the button.

22
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:53,390
Whenever action performed in this button, we will try to open the new customer class as this button

23
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,810
will be used to enter the details for the new customer.

24
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,810
So new customer class will be called in this setting, the visibility of the customer will be true and

25
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,890
current window as false catch block for handling the exception.

26
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,360
Then we have set the bond for the button.

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,690
Its background color as black, foreground color as white, and adding that button to the panel.

28
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,140
Now another button labelled as room, adding the action listener to the room.

29
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,810
Whenever any action performed on the button.

30
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,500
If the room button will be clicked, then we will call the Room Java class of our project so that the

31
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,340
room information can be visible, setting the visibility of the room class as true and current window

32
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,890
as false.

33
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,580
Catch block will handle the exception if any occurs.

34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,520
Setting the button for the button and the room button.

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,300
And.

36
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,150
Background color of the button foreground color of the button.

37
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,870
Adding the button to the content pane, there is another button labeled as all employ and for similarly

38
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:03,240
adding the action performed event where if to imply all employer info button is clicked, then the employer

39
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,290
class will be called and visibility of the employer class will be true and visibility of the current

40
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,130
class will be false.

41
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,290
Catch block will underline the exception if occurs, setting the bound for that all employer info button.

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,860
Background color of the button and foreground color of the button.

43
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,660
Adding the button to our panel.

44
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,640
Third button has the customer info.

45
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,900
Similarly, we have added.

46
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,740
The customer info class.

47
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,870
It's called the customer info.

48
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,990
Setting the visibility as true and setting the visibility of a current window as false.

49
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,900
Catch BLOCK will handle the exception setting the bound for that button.

50
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,940
Background color and foreground color of the button and adding that button to our panel.

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,090
Next button is managed in Photoshop.

52
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:51,550
Have a look on a number of manager and list of manager details of manager adding the action event onto

53
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,420
that manager.

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:59,860
And similarly we have setting the bound for it for run color and background color, adding that button

55
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,360
to the work content panel.

56
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:07,120
Then we are button for as checkout, similarly adding the action event bound of it, foreground color,

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,850
background color and adding that button to a panel.

58
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,700
Similarly for the update check, we will call the update class, set the bound for the button, adding

59
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,070
the background color and foreground color and adding the button to our content pane that is a panel

60
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,150
next button will be updated.

61
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,490
Room status will be whenever event performed on that button.

62
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,350
Then we will call update room class.

63
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,750
And set the bond for the button, set the background color and foreground color, adding that button

64
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,510
to a panel.

65
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,670
Similarly, for the pickup services, we will handle the event by calling the pickup class.

66
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,440
Set the bound.

67
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,530
For the pickup.

68
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,500
Button background color and for of outfits and adding that button to our panel.

69
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,410
Then we have search rooms and for the search room, they will do the same thing and adding the button.

70
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,350
Background color and foreground color, adding that content pane add button search room.

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,120
Then we have a number number seven, that is logout.

72
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:15,730
This will take us back to the login page as we have called login class here.

73
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,320
Whenever any event is performed in this button, setting the button for that button, adding the background

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,350
color and foreground color and content, adding that button to the label, setting the background color

75
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,130
of the complete window as white, and setting its visibility as true.

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,110
So this is our reception.

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,630
Plus, let's move to the ad driver's class.

78
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,890
Here it is, a driver's class.

79
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,520
It is defined also inside the package hotel importing the necessary packages.

80
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:48,030
Abstract Mental Toolkit Swing Swing Border Upside Toolkit Event as well, class and class.

81
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,430
Then we have defined the class which is extending frame and implementing action.

82
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:04,200
Listener panel is private instance variable content pane text fields 20 23334 Combo box combo box and

83
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,620
combo box one button be one and be two and choice of C one.

84
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,100
Inside the main function, we have declared a new object of the driver class and setting visibility

85
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,260
as to inside it.

86
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,240
We have defined the non parameter as constructor setting the bound for the constructor.

87
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,090
Sorry, setting the bound for the frame and the window new panel and sliding the new panel.

88
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,650
Setting that panel into the.

89
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,880
Content paint and setting its layout as well, adding an image to our frame and panel, setting the

90
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,100
bound for it and adding that to our frame.

91
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,130
Another label as ad driver setting the font for it, bound for it, and then adding it to our panel

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,390
and.

93
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:53,470
Another panel has labelled as name setting the colour for it for round colour and font type family and

94
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,800
size of the font setting the bound for it and content adding the label to the panel.

95
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,360
Next is the text field setting the bond for the text field and adding it to our panel set.

96
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:13,740
Next is labelled as age foreground colour for it, background font, setting the font for it and bounding

97
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,340
its position and adding it to our panel.

98
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,700
Next is the another test text field setting bound for it, adding it to our panel next to the vendor

99
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,200
setting foreground color.

100
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:32,260
Setting its font and its bound and adding it to a panel next to the combo box.

101
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,680
It will select ratio buttons like male or female.

102
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,630
So for the gender you either can select male or female setting bound for it, adding that combo box

103
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:46,270
to a comma panel, another which is a car company for one color, for eight font family, for it type

104
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,460
and size, setting the bound for it and then adding that to a panel next this text field.

105
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,650
Bound for it, adding that next to our panel.

106
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,020
Next is car brand for its fallen color, its font, family size and type.

107
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,850
It's bound and adding that to our panel next is text filled for the car brand setting the bound for

108
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,360
it adding it to our panel next is label.

109
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,830
Which is available, setting foreground for it, font type for it, and adding that bound adding it

110
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,260
to the content pane panel.

111
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,120
Next to the combo box one either yes or no setting down for it and availability.

112
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,930
Either you can select yes or no and adding that combo box one to our label.

113
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,680
Next location driver location will be written in this.

114
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,570
And similarly we have added foreground font bound and adding that to a panel.

115
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,190
And there is the text field for.

116
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,860
Location field.

117
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,180
Now we have added a button to add this will button handle the event for add action setting the button

118
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,080
for it, background color, foreground color and adding that button to our frame.

119
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,410
There is also more and more button that is a back button adding a listener to it, bound for it for

120
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,140
background color and foreground color.

121
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,330
Then we have added that button to our panel.

122
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,190
Adding panel background color as white.

123
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,330
Defining the action performed.

124
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,190
Method.

125
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,810
If the event sources from women, then we will stabilize the connection.

126
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,590
Take text text field as name and age.

127
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,940
Gender.

128
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
Company.

129
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,570
Brand availability and location from the respective fields which we have discussed about in the seminal

130
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,740
same class.

131
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,510
Create a query as SDR.

132
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,800
Insert into driver values.

133
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,850
Name a gender company brand and available and its location.

134
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,760
Execute the query using the.

135
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,840
Connection.

136
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,520
Not a statement or execute update.

137
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,710
Passing that string.

138
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,670
And.

139
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,450
Should I lockbox that driver I did successfully and set the visibility of the current window as false

140
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,730
if an exception will be handled by the catch block.

141
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,290
If the button if the event sources from button two, then this window will be closed.

142
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,840
And another exception if an accession occurs.

143
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,730
Let's move to the add employ Java class, which is defined inside the Package Hotel.

144
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,950
We have imported the necessary package.

145
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:21,670
Extended the frame and there are text fields one, two, three, four, five, six text fields and one

146
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,450
comma box.

147
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,220
Inside the non parameterized constructor we have added foreground color as blue background color as

148
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,130
white title as an employee details and default operation as hide on close.

149
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,470
Set size setting the size for the window layout as null.

150
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,790
There is a label passport number that is a name setting font for it, bound for it.

151
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:45,970
And adding that to our panel and another text field for the name setting, it's bound and adding that

152
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,960
to our panel.

153
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:54,760
Then there is a save button that is setting bound for it background and for one color for it adding

154
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,720
to the panel.

155
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:04,030
Similarly, we have a large label of edge text field of the respective age gender for the.

156
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,500
Imply and adding a radio button either can be male or female.

157
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,760
Hear the radio buttons of male or female and address.

158
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,180
Of them blow and a string.

159
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,160
Cause this is the combo box.

160
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:21,910
A string.

161
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,340
Cause either the employee can be a front desk clerk.

162
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:31,870
Porters, housekeeping, kitchen staff, room service waiter, waitress, manager, accountant or chef.

163
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,240
So this is for that label nationality that is equal to annual salary.

164
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,830
So this is for the salary, the text field perspective for the salary.

165
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,900
Phone number.

166
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,630
This is label for the phone number and its respective text field.

167
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,280
Then there is a hard it's respect to text field.

168
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,970
Then there is an email and it's respect to text field to add the email, write by email, setting the

169
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,780
visibility of the current window as true.

170
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,540
And then there's a.

171
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,960
Employee details.

172
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:13,000
Citing employee details and the image icon for the current label, adding that image to the frame.

173
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:23,350
Then next we have added action listener and action performed method in which we have fetched the respective

174
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,920
fields of the employ from text fields.

175
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,550
And if the new radio button is selected as male, then gender is male.

176
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,070
If a female is selected, then gender will be set as female.

177
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,950
Then we have checked for selected item from choice one and establish the connection with the database

178
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,450
inserting those values.

179
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,260
Into the table employee sharing the dialog box dialog box has employee added, catching the exception

180
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,540
and setting the size of the window visibility as true and location and inside main function we have

181
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,790
created the new employer.

182
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,530
Let's see how the reception page will going to look.

183
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,700
Run this file.

184
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,210
Let's.

185
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,040
So when we run this file, this kind of form will appear.

186
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,140
So inside this is the reception.

187
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,980
Now let's look at ad drivers.

188
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:18,240
So when we run add drivers, so it will look like this where we have it.

189
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,430
Name, age and record company carbon availability location.

190
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,450
So that's how a driver class will look at employer class will look like.

191
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,420
This.

192
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,610
So this is the added class where you can select.

193
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,020
This is the job.

194
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,880
Which type of job will he or she will do?

195
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,640
So this is the.

196
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,250
It is.
