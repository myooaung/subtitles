00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.150
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.820
So I hope that you all have went through the introduction and the working of the project part.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:18.670
Well, and in this part we are going to start the coding section of the game in our idea by creating

4
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.070
a new project from scratch.

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:29.770
So after visiting the introduction and working part, you all have a rough idea about what actually

6
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.040
we are going to make in this project.

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.440
What are the functionalities we are going to attach in the programme?

8
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.660
What are the like frame designs we are going to put up in the code?

9
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.200
So I hope everything is now like a roughly clear thing.

10
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:58.360
So now we will like put up things in our organized way to that rough thing, into an organized thing.

11
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.530
So let us start making this project from.

12
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.840
Visual Studio Code Welcome page.

13
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.040
So this is the welcome page of Visual Studio code.

14
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:17.600
And like installing this IDE and installing JDK part has been already covered previously.

15
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.340
So before starting this project, make sure that you all have already installed this compiler Visual

16
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.640
Studio code for writing the program and also the latest version of JDK to make sure that all the Java

17
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.560
functions like Java programming can be done without any errors.

18
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.590
So I'm hoping that all of you have already installed both of them.

19
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.660
So I am going to start this project by creating a new project, by selecting a location and then starting

20
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.340
the code creation.

21
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.100
Okay, so look at this file icon on welcome page.

22
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.350
We call this as Explorer.

23
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.780
And on clicking on this explorer, we will open up our options tab.

24
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.610
So let me increase the font size for better view.

25
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.490
So I hope that that everything is now clearly visible to the viewers.

26
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.370
Now, on this Explorer tab, we are going to select this create Java project option.

27
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.340
Yes, this blue button, we are going to click.

28
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:39.740
So on clicking this, we will be open up our input like text field and we have to select from these

29
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.380
options that what are the toolkits we are going to use in our project?

30
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:54.020
There are several toolkits like Maven, Springboard, Cox Micro Profile and so many other tools in Java

31
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.760
for making Java projects.

32
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.290
But in this project there is no requirement of any other toolkit.

33
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.350
So we will be choosing no build tool options from the like.

34
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.770
This Option Tabs.

35
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.470
So one clicking no build tool option work with source code directly without any build tools.

36
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.700
So we are going to write the source code directly.

37
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.410
Like I already told you, we are going to write the code from scratch, understanding each of the functionalities

38
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.410
and making methods, objects and everything like classes and everything from scratch.

39
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.780
So when selecting this no build tool options, we will open up the file like selection of the project

40
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.170
to select the project location thing and the file chooser your system will open.

41
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.000
And inside this file chooser you have to like select that.

42
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.890
What is the part of the folder you want to keep your project in?

43
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.140
So make sure that you select the project location very carefully.

44
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:14.090
So after that, if you wish to like reopen it, it did not get like messed up or like you forgot where

45
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.200
the location was.

46
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.480
So to make things like less complex, make sure that you select the project location wisely.

47
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:30.260
So I am choosing desktop for creating the folder of the project that we are going to move today.

48
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:40.640
So on clicking desktop and then selecting the project location input tab will again occur like a and

49
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.530
it will ask for a name like input or Java project name.

50
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:52.610
It is asking for and you have to choose a name for your project and that name could be anything of your

51
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.210
choice.

52
00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.800
So suppose like I am naming this game as not like you can name it anything.

53
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:15.410
I am naming it as noughts crosses and to keep things simple, I am not adding any and or any like punctuation

54
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.800
things.

55
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.280
I am simply keeping the folder name as noughts crosses and on hitting enter.

56
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.700
We will land up to a new project like folder will be automatically open.

57
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.900
So I am clicking enter and you will see what happens.

58
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.050
So I click that tab and this new window open.

59
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:48.560
So closing this we are here in our project window and there are several inbuilt files and folders inside

60
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.140
this noughts and crosses project.

61
00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:00.320
So Dot Nest and dot vs code are folders like in which folders which are already like in folders.

62
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:10.880
Whenever we create a Java project in Visual Studio code, also live in RC are the inbuilt folders of

63
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:20.060
our new Java project and the most important folder here which is already appearing is RC folder.

64
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:28.190
Every important file of this code, like all the functional part of this code, is going to be stored

65
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.710
inside this Z folder only.

66
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.650
So there are no important folder folders other than this SLC folder.

67
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:47.000
This ASIC folder is already creating our Java file and inside this file there are like already a classmate

68
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.170
and the class name is app and this thing is going to like execute when there is any of exceptions arise.

69
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.440
Then the application which we are going to make.

70
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:10.250
So suppose that there are some bugs in the applications and the like the compiler wants you to like

71
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.730
the compiler will how the compiler will let you know that.

72
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.040
Some exceptions in your code, like go and debug your code and then again try to run it.

73
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.500
So this is our special feature that we have in Java.

74
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:32.730
Like we have our exception and throwing function which will throw exception whenever there is a runtime

75
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.260
error in your program.

76
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:44.220
So now after covering this after Java file present in the sources folder, now we are going to create

77
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:53.520
our actual file which is going to be required to like made, which is actually responsible for the testing

78
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.710
and running of the application.

79
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.010
And let me choose a name for the file.

80
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:08.730
Like I would like put the name of the file or similar to the name of the folder which I have choose.

81
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:18.240
And the file name is going to be noughts and crosses, so there would not be any pronouns, punctuation

82
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.600
thing.

83
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:29.260
So I named the file as not closest dot java and on hitting enter we will land up to the window of like

84
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.780
that file.

85
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:37.350
So we have created a class, a public class called not process.

86
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:45.390
And inside this we are going to write the actual program which is required for the functioning of this

87
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.380
application.

88
00:08:46.380 --> 00:09:00.270
So in, in the initial steps for this project, we have to declare some of the variables like inside

89
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:00.960
class.

90
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.800
We have objects, we do not have variables.

91
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.480
We call them objects.

92
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.770
And objects are real world entities which we already know.

93
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:20.850
So inside this class we are going to initialize some of the objects required file making this project.

94
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:31.440
So in the beginning we are bothered about like creating the frame inside which the consistence of this

95
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.900
project are going to be placed.

96
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.400
So a private j frame.

97
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:48.710
Private jet frame and let us name the frame as simply frame.

98
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:57.390
So this is the object of the frame which we are going to like make.

99
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:06.460
And firstly, we have to import some of the libraries inside which J frame is consistent.

100
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:19.740
So for the importing frame, we are going to import Java X swing and inside swing we are going to like

101
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.750
call it g frame.

102
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:34.020
So let us write first this and then inside the j string we are going to import J frame P s.

103
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:41.730
So we have imported the frame inside our applications and you can see that there are no letters anymore,

104
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:48.900
after which we are also going to like initialize other variables required.

105
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:57.150
So private text field is the next object g text field.

106
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.980
Yes it is.

107
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:10.770
And that text field is going to be responsible for counting the score of x like we have to place x and

108
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:19.800
or and the second j text field is going to be responsible for counting the score.

109
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:31.080
So, oh, so replacing it with O'Hare and after which we have to like initialize two integer objects

110
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.900
for counting the scores of like x and all so private end.

111
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:50.110
But I didn't and x can't and we will initialize that count to zero in beginning as initially there are

112
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.970
no scores with any of the players so zero.

113
00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:04.450
And similarly for like we have to change the variable we can't put same name for two objects and in

114
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.390
the similar way for oh.

115
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:14.080
So we have successfully created integer objects for storing the scores.

116
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:21.430
Like initially the scores are zero and it will be updated in order we will write, we will like play

117
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:29.350
the game and we have a separate function for updating that score also after which we have to like initialize

118
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.250
a string.

119
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.250
It will be responsible for starting the game.

120
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:45.340
So initially the string is going to be so private string and the string is initially start of the game.

121
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:54.580
So at the start of the game we will call it start game and we will set it to X like we have already

122
00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:03.490
discussed about it that by default the starting player is going to take the symbol X for playing his

123
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.750
or her chance.

124
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:10.180
And we have to enclose this string inside double quotes.

125
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:18.790
And here we are, after which we have like nine blocks, three into three grid for each of the chances

126
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.870
to be played.

127
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:29.110
So we have to like declare we have nine blocks for each chance, so we have to declare nine integer

128
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:35.020
objects for storing the chances of players.

129
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:44.950
So private int, suppose we have block one in the beginning and initially like all the blocks are set

130
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.510
to ten.

131
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.580
And after which we have to copy it.

132
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.110
Nine times and then will change.

133
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.600
One, two, three, four thing.

134
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.940
So changing this 1 to 2.

135
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.740
So you may be wondering, that's why we initialize these.

136
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.890
We want to be nine variables to ten.

137
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.340
Like there are three in into three grid layout.

138
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.050
So we can't set anything less than ten.

139
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.140
We cannot set anything between 1 to 9.

140
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:33.300
Otherwise the values between the blocks will like overlap over one another and it will become difficult

141
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.660
to handle each of the blocks individually.

142
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.060
So we are setting value ten.

143
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.960
Initially, we can take any value greater than nine.

144
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.570
It does not make any difference.

145
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.230
But yes, do not take any integer between 1 to 9.

146
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.410
Now similarly there is an integer I like.

147
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.640
This is going to be the iterator for moving between the blocks.

148
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.230
We will see it later.

149
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.550
So yes.
