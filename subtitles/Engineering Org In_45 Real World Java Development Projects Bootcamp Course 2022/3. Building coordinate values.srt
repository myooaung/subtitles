1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,590
This following image will help understand the coordinated values a bit more.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:12,900
The courtside seats, the coordinates on the Tetris piece, for example, numbers minus one and one

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:23,190
here and minus one and zero and zero zero and zero and the minus one represent are rotated as shape.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,880
So the following diagram illustrates this shape.

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,010
Here you can see the shape as well.

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:39,300
The minus comma, minus one, comma one, the x and the star y minus one and the one the minus one.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,990
And this two zero and the zero zero and the zero, comma minus one here.

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,500
This will be our rotated shape.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,400
So we will apply this logic in our program.

10
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,870
What we will do next, we will write.

11
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,370
Private.

12
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:11,110
Lloyd said X And then to this we will write and index.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:25,690
Coma in NY and after this we will write cards and we will take the index as well with the zero and another

14
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,430
one equal to x and close via curly bracket.

15
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,760
And before that we will write a semicolon.

16
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,890
And after this.

17
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,680
We will do one more thing with the viral.

18
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:51,770
So you will write private void, set y and write in x comma in the y

19
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:54,860
bracket.

20
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:07,820
Open cards next and another one will be the one and equal to y colon and curly bracket close.

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,210
So after this we will write also public X and index

22
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,690
clues.

23
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,310
In this matter, we will write return cards

24
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:41,760
next to one and clues and curly bracket.

25
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:50,340
And similar to this write into why we provide a parameter index here.

26
00:02:50,910 --> 00:03:02,340
And after this, in this matter, we simply write return cards index with the one.

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,010
Simply close the curly bracket.

28
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,650
And another one we have to do for the terminal, that ship.

29
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,770
So we will write.

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,060
Trump.

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,540
No on me.

32
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,790
Another matter.

33
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,250
Get shape.

34
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:36,010
And simply into this matter, we will right return our piece ship.

35
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,940
And simply close it.

36
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,160
No, we have to do one more thing.

37
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,430
We have to set the random sheep.

38
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,860
So before this, we will go.

39
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,340
Okay.

40
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,840
We will write another method for the random sheep.

41
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,550
So here we will call the public void and name it as a sad, random sheep.

42
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,390
So we're set to random sheep.

43
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,610
And to this method, we will create a variable or.

44
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,590
I mean, you know.

45
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,040
Create this object.

46
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:36,140
And after simply this we will write index equal to matter dot and take the absolute of the or dot into.

47
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:50,950
So next in and after this, we have to take the absolute so module seven plus one because we have the

48
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,450
seven shapes, right?

49
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:02,530
So we take the same so import random and simply imported this.

50
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,420
And after this we will.

51
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,590
Call the terminal.

52
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:19,120
Clear the area of the terminal values, take the terminal values

53
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,950
and right set ship into this.

54
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,820
We will provide the values with the x and semicolon.

55
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:44,770
Now what we have to do, we will firstly create this type public int minimum x and in this matter we

56
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:55,810
will create another variable with the area initialization equal to code and set it to zero.

57
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,310
000 and semicolon.

58
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,820
And then we will create a word for loop.

59
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:16,350
In this loop we have to write an equal to ICAM, equal to zero, i.e. less than to four, and then post

60
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,060
increment of i.e. in the letters for loop.

61
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,170
We will write an equal to math dot.

62
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:38,320
We will take the minimum function and here we will give the parameter m comma another error name code

63
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,250
with the next i.e. and this one will be the zero.

64
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,640
So here this thing is done.

65
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,540
And we have to return this value.

66
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,070
So this is set similar to this.

67
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,280
We will create a minimum write.

68
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:18,070
So after this you will write uplift and minimum VI and you will write in equal to cards.

69
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:35,090
Start with the zero and the run and ride for loop int equal to zero i less than to four and post incremental

70
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,810
i.

71
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:47,420
And after this we need our math function for the variable am and am equal to motherboard minimum.

72
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,790
And here we will take the M.

73
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:59,670
Now here we will call cards I and this one will be the one and done.

74
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,920
And again we have to return the value of RAM.

75
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,070
So return and done so this system.

76
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:18,440
Now we have to code our new method which will be rotate a piece to the left so we will create a new

77
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,520
method called this public shape.

78
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:33,200
She did not surrender this matter.

79
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,860
Firstly, this code rotates a piece to the left so the square does not have to be rotated.

80
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,460
That's why we simply return the reference to the current object.

81
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,540
So looking to the previous previous coordinate image, we are to code this as well.

82
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,100
You know you will, right?

83
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:11,770
If I take trapeze shape equal to the terminal dot square shape.

84
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,570
So into this we will write written simply this.

85
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:30,830
After this, we have to create a variable resolved equal to new shape object and often the civil rights

86
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:43,340
result art piece shape equal to this shape and we will create our for loop and right or in equal to

87
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,060
zero.

88
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,340
I.

89
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,560
Let's turn to four and here we will not do the post increment.

90
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:00,500
Here we will take the pre increment of the I and under this for loop we will write.

91
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,110
Resolved it resolved.

92
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,640
Don't settle.

93
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,340
We need a set x.

94
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,100
So you're right.

95
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,030
The same as it is.

96
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,150
And here we will write y.

97
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,770
Under this we will provide the parameter y y to the I.

98
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:34,580
Similar to this we will write result outside to y same as the I in, but here it will be the minus x

99
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:46,250
and that will be the I here c and simply return the result here and here over my person.

100
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,890
The score rotates a piece to the left.

101
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,120
The square does not have to be rotated twice.

102
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:59,180
We simply return the reference to the current object here.

103
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,740
Return this so what we have to do next.

104
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,390
We have to complete this thing and take the rotate right as well.

105
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:19,940
So we will create another matter and simply write public shape and rotate right.

106
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:28,070
Similar to the rotate left under this same if these shape.

107
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,120
Not only do that, draw no square shape.

108
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,440
Simply return the reference to the object.

109
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,810
Return this.

110
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:43,680
And

111
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,150
here.

112
00:11:49,440 --> 00:12:05,760
Same as it is to rotate left as variable result equal to new shape and result piece shape.

113
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:14,990
Peace sheep equal to the beef sheep.

114
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,060
And our brothers.

115
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,950
We need that for same to the previous one.

116
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,690
So we will write.

117
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,890
Four.

118
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,150
I couldn't do zero and I.

119
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,050
Similar to that.

120
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,780
Less than four.

121
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,610
And need the increment of I.

122
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,340
And under this for low we will right result or set.

123
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:57,960
You need the x one provide the index I to the minus vi here and try it and this I now need result set.

124
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:11,180
Why do my here index with the I and here we will see X with the I and simply we are done with our rotate

125
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,270
left and right matter as well.
