1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,780
Now on this matter, we have to change the minesweeper game.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:16,290
So before that we will hear some variables from the cell writer to variable.

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,040
Random is equal to new random.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,490
You

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,890
know here we have to set the in-game variable with true.

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:42,590
Need some minds left people settled with the number of minds here and next we will be doing mean is

7
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,300
the multiplication of the number of rows with the number of columns.

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,990
So it will read all cells.

9
00:00:50,990 --> 00:01:03,750
Here all cells is equal to number of rows is the multiplication with the number of columns here and

10
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,780
done now.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,120
It should be okay.

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,100
We have not created.

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,990
No, it should not be local variable.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,700
Should be an instance variable.

15
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,470
So what should we do?

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,700
We will go here and initialize that variable.

17
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:32,710
So we will write private and animate as all cells.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,180
On the sandstone.

19
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,720
It should not be local variable.

20
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,160
And now what we have to do, we have to set up the minefield.

21
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,820
Every cell is covered by default.

22
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,130
So here we will take a field.

23
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,530
Is initialize that array with the.

24
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,090
On sense.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,060
And then now we need a former law to set up the minefield.

26
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:22,710
So here I will write in equal to zero, and I should be less than all since I increment their bracket

27
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,930
open field.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:35,790
I need to add a field, i.e. index which is equal to cover for cellular.

29
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:44,850
And so these lines set up the minefield and every sale is covered by default.

30
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:54,930
So the next thing which we have to take a while cycle in which we randomly position all mines in the

31
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,620
field.

32
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,530
So what should we do?

33
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,670
Here I will take a wide loop first.

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,160
While I should be less than two.

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,330
And mine's.

36
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,400
Here before that.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,160
We have to take a look and initialize it with the zero here.

38
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,420
Wonder the smile loop.

39
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,160
What do we have to do?

40
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,900
We will right into position.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,690
Is equal to.

42
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,610
All cells.

43
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,740
Multiplication of the random dot next to double.

44
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,360
We have to typecast.

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:02,190
This should be in the parentheses and it should typecast in the entire row.

46
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,100
Done.

47
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,560
And put the semicolon here.

48
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,210
Now we need to go with another condition.

49
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,920
So if.

50
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,780
Here.

51
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,890
I will write.

52
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:23,230
Position is less than all cells.

53
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,240
Okay.

54
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,810
This one and next thing.

55
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,820
I'm in that condition with her and.

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,020
We should check for the field position also.

57
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,310
So field position we have.

58
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,850
No.

59
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,140
We need all three.

60
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,030
Field

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,270
position here position.

62
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,140
It should not be equal to the cover mindset.

63
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,290
So here I will write.

64
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,170
Not equal to forward mindset.

65
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,350
Don't.

66
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,240
When the racketeer.

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,540
Position here.

68
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,500
Sunset and key.

69
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,230
We've all learned one thing here.

70
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:41,460
Also, we have to take the status bar here in the status bar.

71
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,570
Don't sit next.

72
00:05:47,280 --> 00:06:00,420
It should be endangered, ought to string and get the mines left value so done here and now.

73
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:10,770
What we have to do is we have to complete this condition first and we should start with the current

74
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:20,160
column and give it the value in the collection mode and calls.

75
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:35,230
And feel and even the cozy shin value position which really cool to the coal mine.

76
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,560
Sell mine.

77
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,730
Hold on.

78
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,400
It should be I increment and.

79
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,790
Holy --.

80
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,240
Okay, so this is done.

81
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,560
Now we in the vital cycle, we randomly position all mines in the field.

82
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,870
Now what we have to do, we shoot cells.

83
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,140
Each of the cells can be surrounded up to eight cells.

84
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,340
This will not apply with the border cells.

85
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,470
So we raise the number for adjacent cells for each of the randomly placed mine.

86
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,550
So in our example, what we will take, we add one to the top of the cell in this thing.

87
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,670
So what we will do here, I will write to.

88
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,450
Okay.

89
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:34,720
Senate position with end goals to kill the system.

90
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:36,960
Okay.

91
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,740
So here.

92
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,180
I will take some.

93
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,060
Some stole.

94
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,840
What should we say?

95
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,130
Some of the conditions first.

96
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,080
So here I will write.

97
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,360
Current call is greater than zero.

98
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,400
So what should it do?

99
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,330
It will go with the equal to position.

100
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,400
Minus one.

101
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,540
And minus one.

102
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,620
Minus.

103
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,990
No more columns here.

104
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,140
And go with the if

105
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,240
is greater and equal to zero then.

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,060
Key position.

107
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,030
We need the position here.

108
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,290
So if the sell is greater than or equal to zero.

109
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:40,180
So what it should do is field.

110
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,400
Okay.

111
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:51,870
Give the value itself here is not equal to the converted mindset.

112
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,780
Then do one thing.

113
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,730
Field sell.

114
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,200
Set it to the.

115
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:13,140
Three cent plus one equal to one, and then singles the position minus one.

116
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,710
Here we go.

117
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,680
I already take each of the cells can be rounded up to eight cells.

118
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,090
So what should we do to this?

119
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:39,990
We will take the cell with the position minus one here and take the if condition for cell is greater

120
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,910
than equal to zero.

121
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,200
Under that, we will take another f loop f condition and set it with.

122
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,590
If cell is not equal to covered.

123
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,370
Mine fell.

124
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,520
So the field fell.

125
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,330
Explosions are equal to one here and now the next.

126
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:18,800
Another condition for the position with the number of columns side up and then the minus one.

127
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,300
It should be one less.

128
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,300
So here I will write equal to.

129
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:32,430
Position notes, number of columns, minus one here.

130
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:41,670
So we will take the flu for cell is less than all cells.

131
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,330
Then we need if filled with cell.

132
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,160
Not equal to gold mines and.

133
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,790
Field with this Senate.

134
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,130
Plus equal to plus equal to one.

135
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,150
So here, this thing is done.

136
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,000
So what we have done.

137
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:22,790
Okay.

138
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,560
Now we have left some more conditions.

139
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,550
We have to raise the number for decent sales for each of the randomly placed mine.

140
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,400
In our example, we add one to the top level.

141
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,540
So, so cell in the question.

142
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,560
So what should we do?

143
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,600
We need some more aid.

144
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,720
These are only three condition.

145
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,960
We have to take five more conditions.

146
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,570
So here what we will do.

147
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,010
We have the columns minus one.

148
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,420
So next condition, which we need.

149
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,770
As soon as all this.

150
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,280
Okay.

151
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,860
So here after this, we can take.

152
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Then is equal to position minus number of columns.

153
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,450
If we write, sell is lesser than all the sales.

154
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:41,360
So here we will take if field sell.

155
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,140
It is not equal to cover.

156
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,420
Career mindset.

157
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,240
Okay.

158
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:58,880
So in this what we will write, we will take the field cell.

159
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,730
And plus equal to one.

160
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,980
Can you position

161
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,390
the next condition here?

162
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,470
Right.

163
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,620
Third is equal to position.

164
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:31,470
One solution here, which should be either with the number of columns here and leave the condition if

165
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:48,060
sent, is less than all cells so that if field with the cell column is not equal to the cold mine cell,

166
00:13:49,770 --> 00:14:05,070
then next thing, what we need is to fill and send plus equal to one here and next with the current

167
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,970
column position.

168
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,450
Right.

169
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,400
So here I will take.

170
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,760
With the current.

171
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,300
We already created.

172
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:22,370
Current column should be less than the number of columns minus one here.

173
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,920
Under that, we will check.

174
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,790
We will set the sun.

175
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,960
No position.

176
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,620
Minus number of columns here.

177
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,400
And at one.

178
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:48,370
And take another if condition one cell is greater than or equal to zero.

179
00:14:48,380 --> 00:15:03,860
Here what we will write here we will take similar to the previous one if we send not equal to.

180
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,310
Coking coal mines and.

181
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:22,190
This one in this civil right field cell, plus equal to one here.

182
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,940
And don't know next thing which we need here.

183
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,900
This one here.

184
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,280
I will write cell.

185
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,120
Equal to position.

186
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,250
Plus number of columns here, plus one.

187
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:51,210
And the similar condition to the previous one, if said, is less than the old sense.

188
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,900
Take it with the if condition of fuel cell.

189
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,580
Not equal to gold mine sell.

190
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,600
Take it with the field, with cell.

191
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,290
Close equal to one here.

192
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,580
Okay.

193
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,460
So.

194
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,270
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

195
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,890
We have to take one more last condition here.

196
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,650
For this.

197
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,890
What we have to do.

198
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,650
We will write send equal to position plus one.

199
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,610
And next what we have to write here.

200
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,980
If cell is less than to all sense.

201
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,710
Then similar to the previous one.

202
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:04,690
If feel the sun color not equal to covered mind sell.

203
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,510
And done.

204
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:15,640
And here I will write field sell sp+ equal to one here.

205
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:17,880
Okay.

206
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,670
So.

207
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,170
Done so here.

208
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,900
I have done that part.

209
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,320
Okay, so each of the cells can be found in up to eight cells here.

210
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,610
This will not apply to the other cells.

211
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:43,360
So we raise the number for adjacent cells or each of the randomly placed mine.

212
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:52,500
So in our example, we add one to the top of the cell in this next thing, which we have to do.

213
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,430
We have to create a fine three cell method in which we will find the empty cells.
