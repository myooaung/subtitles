1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,090
So while I coded some part, if you closely look, I created different things.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:15,960
First, I created one employee service as an interface which is passing the list with void some data,

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,250
get employees of employees and some fingerprinted.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,450
It's just for page sorting files and everything is going to create sorting the fields and everything.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,480
I created a page employee as my another list.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:37,250
In this, I created one modality which is purely based on GPA, which is going to create columns and

7
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:37,910
everything.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,330
Third thing I created in the service is basically this is interface and to implement in the class,

9
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,540
I created one service.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,170
I mentioned one service.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,240
It's very easy thing.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,550
I mentioned some other wire things and I'm putting in the list and I'm going to create that.

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,270
I'm creating auto generated part so that just the object oriented thing I created with some accessing

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,810
part.

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,240
This is very important.

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,670
I'm descending in the descending order.

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,800
I am creating that field.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,930
I created a one JPG repository to store the cache files and I'm using in this.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,030
So if you close.

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,090
Look, I already created a one controller part in the controller.

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:30,300
I'm going to mention one class name as the employee controller to control the employee parts.

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,230
So.

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,030
It mentioned employee controller.

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:44,280
So this is the main thing which is going to handle the back end and fetching the data.

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,400
It's going to create it's going to access the everything part.

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:56,400
So now it's let me mention the controller in the spring framework that is defaulting, which is basically

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
the controller.

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,780
Again, to it is very important to not create a manual connection.

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,180
Always we can mention the wild thing then private.

30
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,870
I need to mention service.

31
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,390
So employee service I need to create here.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,300
I'm going to mention employee service.

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,160
To employees service.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,390
So it will access that employee service directly.

35
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,130
Now I need to display.

36
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,490
I need what I need to do.

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,870
Display a list of employees in that order.

38
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,480
You can see part of your data or part of each HTML file.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,960
I need to display all the things, so for that purpose I need to create one mapping thing so it's easy

40
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,850
get mapping.

41
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,150
Because get mapping.

42
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,060
Let's.

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:19,360
So why it's giving me the error is because create annotation is mapping at the moment.

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,620
So I haven't added the mapping dependency.

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,190
So you need to access that dependency.

46
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,440
Let me show you.

47
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,300
It's very easy.

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,080
And if your dependence is not added, go to here and add my own dependency in this.

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,290
It will search for mapping and click here add.

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,710
That's it.

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,650
You need to perform.

52
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,450
So wait for some time.

53
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,410
It will.

54
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,510
And my independency dependency for you, which is basically the gate mapping.

55
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,350
As you can see, it's resolving my dependency part.

56
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,730
Ignoring this, I'm going to create further mappings.

57
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,310
Which is basically the string.

58
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,140
View homepage, which is basically homepage view.

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,340
As the name suggest.

60
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,280
More than.

61
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,570
And so it's me asking me to enter to get that mapping part.

62
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,790
So what we can do is just put together, start to optimize the inputs.

63
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,940
So that's it.

64
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,120
I need to mention here, this is basically my method, which is I'm going to perform this view model

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,580
thing.

66
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,100
So a default page is one basically page.

67
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,860
One.

68
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,960
So in this I need to mention the return.

69
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,230
When?

70
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,800
Basically I need to mention that page instead thing.

71
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,080
One, which is basically my one first name as my default thing.

72
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,480
It should be all synchronous.

73
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,190
Or you can say ASCII part and I'm going to mention the model.

74
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:25,740
Now.

75
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,500
You didn't ask me.

76
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,120
What is this?

77
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,600
So.

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,830
It's asking me to create the distance.

79
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,000
But the thing is, I already created in.

80
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,110
Somewhere.

81
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,460
Let me check there.

82
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:45,850
Okay.

83
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,770
So I need to mention this one.

84
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,840
And the thing is.

85
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,660
I need to implement this also.

86
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,740
So let us check why it's giving the error because.

87
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,450
Okay.

88
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,940
We will check it later.

89
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,260
The main I think is the model.

90
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,770
So.

91
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,710
Let me explore.

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,280
Let me do one thing.

93
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,920
It's accessing the everything, but it's not accessing the public public properly.

94
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,090
Right.

95
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,220
So this.

96
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,270
Let me check.

97
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,430
Is there any

98
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,530
we will find find that little part.

99
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,530
So maybe there is one error with.

100
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,390
Mapping part or anything.

101
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,610
So we will check it later.

102
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,440
So we created one mapping for the basic mapping here.

103
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,910
So it's not very complicated data thing, I guess.

104
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,260
So it's just creating a mapping and it's created own mapping part.

105
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,300
So what is it's creating is basically it's creating different things.

106
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,320
So let me do one thing.

107
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,230
Just let me.

108
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,720
Divide this downward and it makes us this.

109
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,440
Let me mention this as this.

110
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,010
And.

111
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,660
I guess this employee controller is basically the.

112
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,720
No, it's not that part.

113
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,150
It's not the fault of this.

114
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,880
In the later part, we need to create one method and defaulting.

115
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,250
So no need to.

116
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,530
What do you about this thing?

117
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,490
So in a similar way, I'm going to create different, different mappings here.

118
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,530
So let me show you what I'm going to do.

119
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,110
So as you can see, I created this part.

120
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,370
Already and least is.

121
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,740
Kim Jong un.

122
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,530
Don't you do not star in the.

123
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,320
Everything okay?

124
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,720
Now, we created this.

125
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,870
So let me tell you what I'm going to do what I'm doing here.

126
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:56,280
So I'm just mentioning view home page for one, the soccer field first name with the ASCII directory

127
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:03,990
with model show new employee form to showing the new employee form with this employee with the model,

128
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,070
then save employee.

129
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,310
So these are the gate mapping and post mapping methods I created.

130
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:16,890
So if you want to check, you can put here or insert also to check whether you can divide dependency,

131
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,730
you can add and you can check everything in the generator generation part.

132
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:27,960
But let me tell you, this is for the ID purposes, then delete employee again this thing then page

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,360
is for the paging part and all the things.

134
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,470
So in the later part I'm going to create one HTML pages and after that I'm going to show you how you

135
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:44,150
can set up first database and after that, how you can implement that database in your application.

136
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,810
Hope we understand.

137
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,650
Thank you.

138
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,220
This is just a controller part which is accessing the controller.

139
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,460
So if you go to insert also, you can check your auto dependencies with different different dependencies,

140
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:04,710
task scheduler and everything you can check so you can directly create team live also here instead of

141
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,530
putting again and again so you can found it.

142
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,140
So this is just a great mapping and set mapping methods and creating push mapping also I created so

143
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:21,140
for the delete employee and everything so by looking this you can check your is very easy you can perform

144
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,590
hope you understand.

145
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,460
Thank you.
