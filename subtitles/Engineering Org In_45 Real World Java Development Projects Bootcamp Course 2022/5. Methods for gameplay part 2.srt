1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,000
So I already created the rectangle and everything.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,990
Now I need to mention the ball collision part here.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,650
So let us create that check map.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,930
Collision with the ball, or you can check anything.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,210
So I am mentioning as ball collision.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,420
In a 30 year.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,410
For that purpose.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,210
I'm mentioning this a four.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,480
Which is basically for each.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,510
You can check it.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,090
For.

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,270
And I is equal to zero.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,580
Again and again changing.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,550
So I mentioned like a four year.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,250
I use less than map I'm accessing, which is I'm going to create it later in later.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,660
But map link.

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,620
Otherwise I will explain the code.

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,000
Also, it will be beneficial for you also.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,720
In that.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,990
Also, I'm going to check your another method.

21
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:03,990
Geez, Liz.

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,810
Then again, map.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
At zero position map.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,580
Dot map.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,390
Which is basically what I'm going to use here, my primary dataset for my plant.

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,100
And just business as usual.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,420
So A I'm going to use your as you can check here just again and again for so you can check your Internet

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,870
for loop.

29
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,210
You can assume that like that.

30
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,930
So if.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,070
What a map.

32
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,160
Dot map.

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,320
Is going to exceed then I or Jay.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,500
If we're going to exceed them, I urge.

35
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,000
Score should be.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,270
Plus.

37
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,010
Plus, but.

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,720
Our beacon can everything should be changed.

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,790
So for that purpose I'm mentioning.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,910
And Brick.

41
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,160
X is equal to J Star.

42
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:19,090
Matt which is basically nothing but changing the brick width and everything, which is I'm going to

43
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,970
create later plus 80.

44
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,310
So you're going to assume that it will be disappear.

45
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,470
And now with similar.

46
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,550
But here I'm going to mention why.

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,480
51, which is again increasing.

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,000
And.

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,210
Very good.

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,610
Is equal to.

51
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,550
Map dot brickwood.

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,160
So that's a method to create your own.

53
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,160
So it's giving me a role because it's not defined what?

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,790
My function is not generated and.

55
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,810
And for God to change your life.

56
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,700
It's not always.

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,310
Did you write?

58
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
And with this, I'm going to create.

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,730
Similar thing again, a brick.

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,640
Eat.

61
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,980
Medicate with medicate.

62
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,080
So I need to mention this now.

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,420
I need to create one rectangular thing here.

64
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,240
Which is again one map function you can check.

65
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,140
Rectangle rect is equal to new.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,790
Again, I'm taking part of rectangular with brick.

67
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,250
Dix.

68
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm going to use your.

69
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,460
Well, Brick, I am going to use here.

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,820
Brick Village.

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm going to use you.

72
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,830
And with Brick Height, which is basically my four dimension of everything.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,460
Brick height, not height.

74
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,390
So.

75
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,000
That's things I created.

76
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,400
Now, similarly, I need to create a rectangle for ball.

77
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,530
So I created a ball, but I need to mention ball in a rectangle.

78
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,930
So this is not visible actually.

79
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,830
But it acts like a rectangle to check bouncing and everything.

80
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,460
So.

81
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,950
New rectangle always as in Java.

82
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,430
The term pole position.

83
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,930
X ball position y.

84
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,160
And I guess it's starting point.

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,980
Is 2020 enough.

86
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,700
And one thing remaining is Rick Stengel.

87
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,590
Not Rectangle.

88
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,850
Be correct.

89
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:41,670
You are going to grip is equal to it, so it will assign it automatically while deploying anything on

90
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,710
exactly that part.

91
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,020
So now I am going to create right or left bouncing part.

92
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,510
So I'm going to create one.

93
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,140
Your bouncing mechanism of over.

94
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,160
Also let me mention as one thing make of.

95
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,630
Game.

96
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,830
Bouncing mechanism of overboard, basically.

97
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,160
So if my ball.

98
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:22,670
Gambon is going to direct with ball rectangle intercept intercepts, that middle part, which is brick.

99
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,490
So okay.

100
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:33,770
So what I will do is first I will create your one brick mechanism, not bouncing brick mechanism of

101
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,220
game.

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,590
Which is very important.

103
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,660
So I will create a mechanism.

104
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,470
After that, I will create that bouncing mechanism.

105
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,530
It is hitting that intersects with that big rectangle.

106
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,620
So.

107
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,820
Always I need to mention it in this and be correct.

108
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,220
Small so.

109
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,210
Be correct.

110
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,860
What will happen?

111
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,870
Matt.

112
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,040
Split frequently I'm going to create in that map function brick value.

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,060
So it's basically disappeared.

114
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,240
No need to worry about this functioning.

115
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,280
Just basically disappearing that brick.

116
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,170
School will be increasing for you.

117
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,470
As This is my method, we will increase by five and total bricks.

118
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:37,020
If you're minus minus, which is basically decreased, total mix will be decreased in the code.

119
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:38,920
Mm hmm.

120
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,160
Okay.

121
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,210
Now I need to mention.

122
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,290
But when ball hit to right or left of the.

123
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,660
Intersected, just like intersecting or intersecting that part.

124
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,140
But I haven't mentioned like.

125
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,000
Wall.

126
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,040
It to right or left of brick.

127
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,270
It should be disappear because it just like touching up that big.

128
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,850
So it can be bounced from that.

129
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,600
But also.

130
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,290
Or it can be fitting that part.

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,470
Why?

132
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,060
It's give me no nothing.

133
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:19,960
Oh.

134
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,940
I went completed this.

135
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,910
Now I need to create the logic for that also.

136
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:32,940
If.

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,950
Wall.

138
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,990
Position.

139
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,070
Like the explanation for injection.

140
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,800
Plus 19.

141
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:56,190
It's less than or equal to ball rectangular, which is basically ball rectangular x coordinate.

142
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,250
Order.

143
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:09,490
You can create a condition for or also or ball position X again, which is basically my right part of

144
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:11,650
brick.

145
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,230
Plus when.

146
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:24,050
Now remember why I'm not giving again or 1919, because if I'm considering as more part of lift now,

147
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,960
I should mention less part of it of that.

148
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,770
So.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,430
Brick again.

150
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,880
Rectangular brick, correct.

151
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,640
And.

152
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,100
Wait a minute.

153
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,820
What is this?

154
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,520
Or.

155
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,530
We're doing it.

156
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,820
It should not be pole position.

157
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,170
It should be correct.

158
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,890
Let me do one thing here.

159
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,260
I'm going to change this variable because I'm confusing again and again.

160
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,620
So.

161
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,590
And so I'm mentioning this, so it should be very correct.

162
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,230
And should we be correct?

163
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,750
Now it's considerable.

164
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,680
If it's like this x.

165
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,230
And explosion, basically.

166
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,240
That's not complete logic.

167
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,960
Plus.

168
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,660
It should be.

169
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,440
Very great.

170
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,660
Dot.

171
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,450
We it also.

172
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,830
So let me mention.

173
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,660
So that's a user defined method.

174
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,060
If that happens.

175
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,420
Mortgage deduction should be changed because just like putting.

176
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,680
Well, extradition should be changed, so I'm going to change that bold direction in the opposite way.

177
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,410
When top to bottom.

178
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,300
Top or bottom?

179
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,590
Not top to bottom.

180
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,050
Top to bottom of top or bottom of that part brick.

181
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,000
I need to mention Elle's condition here.

182
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,520
Again, while y direction should be changed.

183
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,080
We can assume that it should be negative.

184
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,050
That's basically opposite of that.

185
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:15,980
So.

186
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,440
So balancing condition of our listing.

187
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:27,650
So I need to break here, which is basically breaking the EPA, which is I'm not going to continuously

188
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,150
calling this again and again.

189
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,070
So these things are enough, I guess.

190
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,120
Enough.

191
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh, no.

192
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,870
I need to mention one thing here.

193
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,870
Which is we are now.

194
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,480
Out of you can take this ball collision.

195
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,750
Now, once ball collision is done.

196
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,120
I need to specify.

197
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,490
This says bold because for further creating an everything.

198
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,580
I am updating.

199
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,830
My ball directions, the game ball direction.

200
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,790
I'm going to update.

201
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,750
So now what I'm going to create is very simple, just bouncing conditions.

202
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,700
If you know this part, it's very helpful.

203
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,630
Otherwise, you can drop this part.

204
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,860
Also, it's not very important, but for seamless gameplay, I'm going to create this.

205
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,440
Otherwise you have to again and again closing and opening the game.

206
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,560
So for such purpose, I'm creating this.

207
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,670
Now it's very similar.

208
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,680
Now, if I'm mentioning one I should mention here.

209
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,080
Why?

210
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,120
Because I already created this.

211
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,200
So he's just basically moving or bouncing condition.

212
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,080
You can check here.

213
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,790
If it's less than zero, it should be opposite.

214
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,440
If again, this should be why and we'll look at it.

215
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,250
This is y.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,640
So this for top and bottom.

217
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,590
Now, let me mention for lower and upper part.

218
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:25,800
So for why constraint there should not be any conditions for or x which is basically left and right

219
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,160
should be the is condition because below of that it's going to give me the game over part.

220
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:39,690
So I'm as I mentioned, these things are done and we paint I'm going to call which is basically.

221
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,690
Calling these things again.

222
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,700
So now we are done with our gameplay mechanism.

223
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,640
So now what things are remaining, which is basically map generator functions, which is I'm going to

224
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,820
create it, which is basically very similar to these things, but I'm going to use some color strokes,

225
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,540
graphics, 2D mechanisms which will be helpful to create me a map generator.

226
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,610
So in a later part, I'm going to create one map generator function.

227
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,660
So in that part you will understand what is the map generator thing?

228
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,210
And now I'm going to call that in me.

229
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,590
Hope you understand.

230
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,640
Thank you.
