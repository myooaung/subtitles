1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.370
So here is the check hotel class.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.040
This class is defined inside the package travel.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:13.890
We have imported the necessary packages like Java X dot Spring Java .8.8. event and Java Diet file.

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.790
When we are public.

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.170
Last check hotels which is extending j frame and implementing renewable.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.880
There are the j labels.

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:31.420
There are 19 labels and one caption sorry label and one thread as well.

8
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.220
Then they will be able to find the public void to run method.

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.570
Let me.

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.460
There is the constructor non parameterized constructor inside which we have set the bound for that frame

11
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.450
and color.

12
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.830
Now we have defined the thread or the current instance of the class and define the label bound for that

13
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.180
label for one color and font for that label, adding that label to our frame.

14
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.940
Then we have defined the image.

15
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.730
Added that image to the label, setting the bound for that label, adding that label to the frame.

16
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.200
Setting the layout of the frame as null.

17
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.260
Another image of the hotel to image.

18
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.850
And.

19
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.550
Hiding that image to the label, setting bound for it, adding the label and setting the visibility

20
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.960
of the label as false.

21
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.350
Then we have similarly added another image in the label setting bound for the label, adding that label

22
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.140
to our frame and setting the visibility as false.

23
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.970
Similarly, we have another image added to the label bound for it and setting the label to our frame.

24
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.190
Then we have set the visibility as false.

25
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.730
Then there is another image icon which we have added in our label and setting the bound for it, adding

26
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.870
that label to our frame.

27
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.510
Then we have set the visibility as false.

28
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.750
Then, uh.

29
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.160
There are another label, another image of the label.

30
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:13.010
So this class is basically let us show the images of the image, images of the hotels one by one.

31
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.190
After a particular period of time, it will look like us.

32
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.530
Slideshow So that's why we are having so much labels with the image.

33
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.470
So there are these images.

34
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.410
And here is the another image.

35
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.610
19 and ten, the image have been added.

36
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.350
Then we have here to start.

37
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.700
Now, let me show you this run method.

38
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.210
Public void run method.

39
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.940
They are defined.

40
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.590
So inside the try to dot set visible through and it will be setting visible to caption will be set to

41
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.670
J Marriott Hotel.

42
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.100
And I read that caption to the label.

43
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.680
Then thread dot sleep 28,000.

44
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.700
This will be for that time period for 2.8 seconds.

45
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.680
This will sleep and then will set the visibility of that false.

46
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.010
Similarly, we done for the L three.

47
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.940
After the L three we will be showing l four.

48
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.680
After L four we will be showing l five after l five and six.

49
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.200
Similarly, l six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11.

50
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:33.610
All these labels will display and height with the given interval of time.

51
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.080
And let me show you basically the output of this.

52
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.020
But this is how the output will look like.

53
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.480
It will change every 2.8 seconds.

54
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.980
This is the output.

55
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.160
Keep changing, the thread will stop.

56
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.920
So the class have been run and all the hotels are being shown.

57
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.440
So this is how this class is working.

58
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.990
I have shown you the output part because that will let you understand more clearly.

59
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.510
What's the idea behind adding those images in these labels?

60
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.790
So many labels and so many images.

61
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:46.060
This is because we want to show a label at a time and that's why we have used thread as well.

62
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.820
So Thread will help us to manage multiple process at a time.

63
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.380
So this is how this check class is working.

64
00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:04.130
This will be used to show the information of the hotels from our project page, which will be visible

65
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.380
after the successful login.

66
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:15.800
Now let's have a look at the booked hotels file, which is defined inside the package travel.

67
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:24.950
We have imported the necessary packages, Java, JWT, layout, everything, and after that we have

68
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.810
defined the class.

69
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.210
Which is extending the frame.

70
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.710
Then we have initialize the Shape panel, which is a private instance and a choice.

71
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.370
So even inside the main function, we have invoked the event.

72
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.060
Invoke later newer enabled inside which we have defined the public void.

73
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:56.390
Run and inside the public void run we have defined the view total object and set the visibility of it's

74
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.100
true.

75
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.700
After that, we have defined the parameterized constructor of this class build book.

76
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:12.550
Total is string username and after that there is a set of bound for it, adding a new panel setting

77
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.570
panel to our frame, adding layout for the panel.

78
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.870
Then there is an image icon creating the image icon, adding the image icon to our label, setting the

79
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.240
bound for the label, adding that label to our frame.

80
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.080
After that, there is a label labeled as the Book Hotel.

81
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.560
It is setting font for it, bound for it, adding that door frame.

82
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.810
Then there is a label username setting bound for it, adding that to our frame.

83
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.770
Then there is a backend label which will fetch details from the hotel and there is a label name and

84
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.550
respect to.

85
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.430
We have a.

86
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.650
We have a label.

87
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.020
Back end table here.

88
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.080
And then we have a level number of persons for which we have a back end label.

89
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.090
The back end label will store the information from the database a number of days, similarly for which

90
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.320
you have the end label.

91
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:18.280
Similarly, we have a gender back end label for the we have a label as a common ESI for which we will

92
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.160
be having a second label which will store data from the database.

93
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.920
Then there is a label for included, yes or no.

94
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.190
For that we have accountable as well.

95
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.760
Then there is ID.

96
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.280
Similarly for the respect we have.

97
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:44.390
And then after that, we have a level number four that we will also have a back end label.

98
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:50.320
After that, there is a label deposit phone number and there for that we have also that can label which

99
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.240
will store the information from the database.

100
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.720
Then there is the label cost and added that label to our frame.

101
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.800
And then with respect to that, we have label G frame.

102
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.050
We have a label L ten, which will be added to the panel.

103
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.260
Then we have initialize the connection with the database.

104
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:18.660
After that, inside the block we have initialized the results at zero to execute query select as strict

105
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.470
from book hotel.

106
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:26.640
We are username is equal to username so that query will be executed and the data will be fetched from

107
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.250
the book hotel table where the username will match.

108
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:38.670
And while iterating over those records, these statements will add data inside the labels which we have

109
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.630
left vacant.

110
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.820
So these texts have been printed on those labels.

111
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.930
Now we have closed the connection, close the result statement and cast the exception, if any occurs.

112
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.030
After that, there is a pattern back which will help us to move back from this window.

113
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.770
Those void action performed inside which we have set the visibility as false.

114
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.470
Set the visibility as false.

115
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.070
No button, not exit.

116
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.530
We have set the bounds.

117
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.690
For that exit button, background color, foreground color, adding that button, exit button to the

118
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.920
panel.

119
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.310
Then there is a button.

120
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.630
We have set the background color of the complete window as white.

121
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.760
So this is all about the World Book Hotel file.

122
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.100
So now let me show you the output of to check what sort of file.

123
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:50.450
This will be the output of the Czech Hotel, which will show you all the all the hotels list of the

124
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.170
hotels.

125
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.930
So let this finish.

126
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.420
Then we will have a look on the give the book hotel or Java file output.

127
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.640
So this is completed.

128
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.070
Now let's have a look on the total.

129
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.590
I'll put up this file.

130
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.050
So this is how it is showing.

131
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.030
The details have not been showing because we have not added any username or details in our database

132
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.470
yet.

133
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:40.140
We will be doing that when we have a look in our live video, which will be the very last video of this

134
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.770
project.
