WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.440
What we will do.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.990
First thing, we will create a new Java project by the name so called video game here under the CRC

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:18.960
package I have my package here, my name and under that I have seven classes, but one is for actor,

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.540
no drama.

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.920
Second one is the third one for the baggage.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.170
And fourth one is the mean of our board and the other one is the player.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.110
And next thing, which will we have the so called and so command will be our main class here.

8
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.040
So another one we need the whole and under next resource package we have 40 meters.

9
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.750
First one is for the area and next one is the baggage which we have to move.

10
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.280
Next thing is the so called which will be the main player and here the one which will be the layout

11
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.450
of the board.

12
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.360
So what we have to firstly here I have done.

13
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.060
Created all these classes already.

14
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.400
What we will do, we control this one object with cursor keys.

15
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.080
We can also press the r e to return the level.

16
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.120
So when all bags are placed on the destination areas, the game is finished.

17
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.860
So we draw completely string in the left upper corner of the window.

18
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.090
So what we have to do, firstly, we need a board class here, this one under this board class, what

19
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.890
do we have to do?

20
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.080
Mainly this game is simplified.

21
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.580
It only provides the basic functionality and the game has only one level only.

22
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.100
So under this board class, firstly we will design a word game.

23
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.860
So here I will explain.

24
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.640
It inherits the G panel.

25
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.690
Now under this, what do we have to do?

26
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.730
We will write private for an end.

27
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.080
It will be name as offset here, which will be equal to the 30th.

28
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:28.340
And another variable which we need is a private final int by the name space on equal to 20.

29
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.350
Next thing which we need is the private final int.

30
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.260
It will be the left coalition.

31
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.850
Okay.

32
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.070
The last collision and it will be equal to the one next thing which we need the private final end,

33
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.070
and it will be the right collision here.

34
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.790
Right coalition are literally equal to the two here.

35
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.680
Other one which you need the private final in.

36
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.290
We need the top coalition also.

37
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:16.010
And here it will be equal to the three next one, which we need is the private final in the bottom coalition.

38
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.610
Here, it will be equal to the pool.

39
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.680
So the wall image is 20 by 20 blocs and this reflects the space constraint.

40
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.870
So the offset is the distance between the borders of the window and the game world.

41
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.070
And there are four types of coalition here.

42
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.660
Each one is represented by a numerical constraint.

43
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.810
So here these are the numerical constraints for these left.

44
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.810
One is for one, right, one is for two, one is for three and the bottom is one for four.

45
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.480
Now we need some ArrayList.

46
00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.030
So here I will write a private red list for the role.

47
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.410
Here I will do roles here.

48
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.920
The next one, which I will need, is the private ArrayList.

49
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.650
And under this we need the package.

50
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.010
After that box here.

51
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.980
Another one is for released for area.

52
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.370
It will be eight years.

53
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:38.390
So here the wall bags and areas are special containers which hold all the body bags and ears of the

54
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.900
king.

55
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.860
Now we need a word player.

56
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.050
Very well here.

57
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.930
So I will write private players.

58
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.660
So.

59
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.190
And next one, we need the width and the height variable here.

60
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.090
So I will write private in edge, which will be equal to zero.

61
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.510
Next one is the private and.

62
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.210
W is equal to zero here.

63
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.340
And next thing which we need.

64
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.490
Okay.

65
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.450
So now what we need?

66
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.360
We need a level of the game.

67
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.290
So here I will take a string level.

68
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.700
So here I will write Private.

69
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.140
And I will make a string variable on this.

70
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.210
I will name it as the level and here I will give the level of my game first.

71
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.380
So here I will take.

72
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.730
Here.

73
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.210
We need some.

74
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.550
Firstly, I will do and then I will explain it.

75
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.060
What I'm going to do here needs.

76
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.340
Need some.

77
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:11.340
Kid three We need five, six on the backslash.

78
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.270
And here.

79
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.330
After that, we will need.

80
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.280
And the third one, which will be.

81
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.810
To hash.

82
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.100
Okay, Ash, then.

83
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.700
I will need a backslash.

84
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.540
And here.

85
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.660
Here.

86
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.570
Richard Peters.

87
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.030
Nicole Kidman.

88
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.780
Keep this control.

89
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.250
Let's see here.

90
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.730
Can we?

91
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:25.960
And I will be a donor here and then make one Swiss lesser known we here.

92
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.610
I will take.

93
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.580
Previous to hash share.

94
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.600
Do none.

95
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.890
Now.

96
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.290
We need our dollar here.

97
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.660
None.

98
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.900
Look.

99
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.680
Next thing here.

100
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.760
What we will do here, I will call.

101
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.670
Do I need a dollar?

102
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.560
Of course.

103
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.060
And then I need another dollar here.

104
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.450
Here.

105
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:17.780
Here, I.

106
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.820
Right.

107
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:31.840
And I repeat three hash, five more hash for this one is fine here.

108
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.270
No, six hash and.

109
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:46.330
Harsh and harsh and the food this.

110
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.980
Marry click and under four hashes.

111
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.470
One, two, three, four.

112
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.050
Here.

113
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.610
Just confidence.

114
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.210
No.

115
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.050
Here I will take.

116
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.900
Ashley and just copy.

117
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.650
Copy.

118
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.850
Would hash.

119
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.770
Need to specify this.

120
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.030
You.

121
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.520
Let's see.

122
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:30.720
Just to be here and here, I will flip to Nolan.

123
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.340
And then again, a dollar here.

124
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.920
Just remove this.

125
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.340
Okay.

126
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.560
Don't need this one here.

127
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.540
I will do one thing here.

128
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.960
I will take another food hash.

129
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.970
It will be to six hash.

130
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.240
Need another three hash here.

131
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:15.020
And then after a night here, I will write a trade and meet other to hash.

132
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.870
And.

133
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.370
This.

134
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.820
Okay.

135
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:25.150
So.

136
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.680
Which brings me here.

137
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:33.630
To.

138
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.030
We need three six something.

139
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.720
934, five, six, seven, eight.

140
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.590
We just remove the space here?

141
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.750
Remove this one, too.

142
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.600
Okay.

143
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.630
So here.

144
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.240
Almost two dozen.

145
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.490
Next one I will take.

146
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.310
I did.

147
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.100
Whether it.

148
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.430
One, two, three, four, eight.

149
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.800
Just need some little space.

150
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.120
Okay.

151
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.220
So here.

152
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.020
Just put a semicolon here.

153
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.800
So this will be the level of our game.

154
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.370
Here.

155
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.300
Here.

156
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.200
What?

157
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.310
This.

158
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.830
Except for this species here.

159
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.880
There are five characters.

160
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.120
The hash stands for the world.

161
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.050
And here the dollar represents the box to move.

162
00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:02.790
And here, these dot characters represent the place where we must move the box.

163
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.940
And this character is the so common.

164
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.070
And finally, the new line here.

165
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.700
Slash starts a new row of the world.

166
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.910
So this will be the level of our game.

167
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.710
You does, right.

168
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:31.530
So once again, the hashes transponder $1 represent the box to the DOT, represent the place where we

169
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.660
must move the works here.

170
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.400
This will be our place here.

171
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.940
The ad character is just so common.

172
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.270
The main player of our game and slash and starts a new route of the world.
