00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:02.830
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:10.210
So let us quickly summarize that what we have learned by far through this watered down application.

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.210
So from the beginning we have created a notepad class.

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.550
We have created menu items as file, edit and health and inside file.

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.570
We have added new open save print and exit options inside the edit menu board option we have added cut

6
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.770
copy paste select on and inside the help menu bar.

7
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.450
We have added the about section of this noted down application.

8
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.240
Also, we have added a text area which is the soul of this text editor.

9
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.290
Note ten down.

10
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.820
So then we have also set the title for the main body of the frame which we have created.

11
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.720
We have added the file open save print option to the constructor so that it becomes working.

12
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.340
We have added similarly the edit options to the constructor and then we have created a scroll bar for

13
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.270
the text area.

14
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.000
So where we have created a text area and it is very necessary that it should be scrolling like we can't

15
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.510
type a single line in the code and wait for it to complete this project.

16
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.590
We have to make a proper functioning text editor.

17
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.880
This is the goal of making this application that we can write in finite number of lines in our text

18
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.280
file, edit it, save it, print or whatever we want to do with it.

19
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.660
So it is.

20
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.610
Now every button in the notepad has an action attached to it.

21
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.770
Like if we click in the new file, we have to open a new window in that notepad.

22
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.460
When we click on the Open File Action Listener button, we have to open a file from our computer like

23
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.700
a previously saved file, already present existing file in our computer.

24
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.020
And if we click on the save button, then we there the computer desktop or wherever we want to save

25
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.790
save it.

26
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.580
It should open similarly for exit cut and copy.

27
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.430
So now.

28
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.090
Yes.

29
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.200
So the action performed.

30
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:38.790
Event is called here as a function and it has various conditional operators if inside a ls.

31
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.500
So for the new option we have created if conditional loop, which says that by default this app opens

32
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.290
up and a new window is open by default, which is initially set to null, the text inside the text area

33
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.580
is set to null.

34
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.550
Similarly, we add once we have to click only one button so that if we click on the new button, then

35
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.400
this action is going to be performed if we clicking on.

36
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.560
So let me first add the options to it like we have.

37
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.000
Save button inside the file menu bar.

38
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.670
We have print option.

39
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.820
We have an exit button which helps us to escape through the application.

40
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:42.860
We have edit options such as cut, copy, paste as if we are writing something.

41
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.790
The main use is of copying and pasting.

42
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.560
Like suppose we have to paste some data from another resource.

43
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.770
Then we have to use this paste option.

44
00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.510
So suppose if the application does not contain a paste option, is it fruitful?

45
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.130
No, not at all.

46
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.070
The paste option is very important.

47
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.560
So adding it to the queue selection.

48
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.410
Suppose we have to write this text.

49
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.980
Like suppose we are composing an email or something like that.

50
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.450
So we have we want to write it in the notepad in the offline mode.

51
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:32.150
So we wrote the content and want to select all at once with a single shortcut button or with a mouse

52
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.400
with a single click.

53
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:42.440
So this select all option contains that feature and about buttons, which gives us an intro about this.

54
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.090
Now let us check what is left.

55
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.190
We have an open new save print exit, cut, copy, paste, select all.

56
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.970
And I think we have covered all of them.

57
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.050
Yes.

58
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.060
New open save print exit.

59
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.310
We have total of ten scenes which I need to be action lesson.

60
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.680
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

61
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.970
So yes, we are done.

62
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.030
So let's remove this extra one.

63
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.230
Yes.

64
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.320
So customize this save button.

65
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.400
Like what?

66
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.870
Action to be perform.

67
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.350
When we click the save button, we have already decided that what is going to happen when you click

68
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.430
that new button?

69
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.020
Now an action should be attached with the save button as well.

70
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.040
So if we write some text in the notepad, we want to save it.

71
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:53.000
So calling the J file chooser component from the String Library of Java Toolkit, we are going to do

72
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.260
the same thing.

73
00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:03.760
So j file chooser naming the method as file chooser and a new keyboard with the J file chooser.

74
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.340
Yes.

75
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.690
So here we are.

76
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.250
This function is invoked here j file chooser.

77
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.250
Now we have two steps.

78
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.360
Select that in which format we want to save our text like we have various extensions attached to file.

79
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.530
You must have seen them in some of them we have dot PDF.

80
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.350
In some of them we have got MP three dot MP for like for videos.

81
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.480
We have extension of dot MP four.

82
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:43.880
So it is already decided in the program that what action is to be saved, what action, what extension

83
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.820
is to be added to this file.

84
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:53.210
So in that text field we declare that this text field is going to be saved as a dot extension.

85
00:06:53.210 --> 00:07:01.520
So in initializing this as file name extension filter.

86
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.070
We are going to add a filter that it filters.

87
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.990
That is a text field.

88
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.980
Text ext.

89
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.470
Text filter.

90
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:25.370
And a new keyword saying that by extension further.

91
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.530
And inputting a string inside this method has only text files.

92
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.430
Only text files?

93
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.420
Yes.

94
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:46.380
And in brackets, I'm going to add the dot extension like this.

95
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.350
So I think this is done and.

96
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.200
The XD as a string also.

97
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.050
Now closing the statement air.

98
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.350
Now, if we want to save anything, we have to open the file.

99
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.730
Choose our menu from our system.

100
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.970
So how to open that file?

101
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:16.990
Choose an option.

102
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.160
Like, let me show you what I want to sing.

103
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.050
So on running the program, we have our notepad window.

104
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.940
Let us try to type some random text and suppose we want to save it.

105
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.140
So on clicking on the save button.

106
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:43.530
That should be a file chooser of our desktop or system should be open so that we can choose that where

107
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.600
we want to save this file.

108
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.010
Like in which folder?

109
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.770
What will be the path where this will be saved?

110
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.340
So let's add a method for that.

111
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.720
So this is going to be as fine chooser.

112
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.610
Not set acceptable filters.

113
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.780
That acceptable file filter used?

114
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.000
Yes, this is the method.

115
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.890
And inside we are going to add the boolean argument as false.

116
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.430
So this is said to be false as we only want dot text files.

117
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.130
So again, file chooser.

118
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.590
And choose the ball.

119
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.080
Fine filter.

120
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.560
And inside this we can only allow the text filter.

121
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:40.930
We cannot make it as MP three, MP four or anything else.

122
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.980
We just simply want a text filter inside the filter.

123
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:53.020
So yes, now the action is initialized as in action.

124
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.880
And while chooser.

125
00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.010
Tune.

126
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.090
Sure.

127
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.210
Save dialog.

128
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.650
It is not.

129
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:17.510
So now let us try to run this on running this notepad or Java, clicking on run Java and waiting for

130
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.090
the program to execute.

131
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.080
Yes.

132
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.390
So let's try to type something.

133
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.470
Hello World.

134
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.840
I am Java developer.

135
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.530
Yes, the text is ready now.

136
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.030
Suppose you want to save it.

137
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.980
So initially there were no actions performed by clicking the buttons.

138
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.990
But now you can see that our action is attached to the button.

139
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.780
So on clicking on Save Button Action should perform.

140
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.040
So yes, perfect.

141
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:57.740
On opening this and clicking the save button, this is open a file chooser option from your system and

142
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:06.010
you can save it as hello the see there is a text filter which are the only text files we added only

143
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.800
text filter.

144
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.420
So it is showing that.

145
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.280
So hello dot text and click on save.

146
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.670
So they should be saved in your system.

147
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.200
Let us check for it.

148
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:19.850
Save.

149
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.210
Inside the documents searching for it.

150
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.360
It should be a hell or java.

151
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.880
So there are no files.

152
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:38.430
There are some more modifications needed to be made in this action list.

153
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:53.830
So in action and contained or if else, conditional law which says so after adding this try and catch

154
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.440
exception handlers.

155
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.620
Now we can save our files and get to see the results.

156
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.810
So I'm running this.

157
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.650
And that's some random texture like.

158
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.180
Hello, everyone.

159
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.260
And try to save it by clicking on the save button.

160
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.650
Suppose I want to save it in the desktop.

161
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.800
And name it as hello.

162
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.840
Only text file filters as we have created it.

163
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.560
Now let us see that it is saved in the desktop or not.

164
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.470
So when we open again the desktop.

165
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.740
Yes.

166
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.910
So yes.

167
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.030
Hello.

168
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.960
Dot txt successfully saved.

169
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.070
So the save option is completely functional now.

170
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:53.300
Now for in a similar way, let us try to make this print option also functional.

171
00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:01.880
So for the print case, there is a simple logic which opens the print window.

172
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.570
Stadia doctrine to call this and.

173
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.650
Adding a try and catch exception.

174
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.910
Makes printing things from the notepad very easy.
