1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,940
So inside this video, in this video, we will be talking about the Puzzle Java file.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,920
So it is defined inside the package apps and we have imported the necessary package like Java, Java

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,620
dot dot event and Java exports thing.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,600
After that, we have defined public class puzzle, which is extending the frame and implementing action.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,420
Now after that, we have defined the buttons b1, b2, b three, B, four, five, six, seven and B

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,320
eight and B nine.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,700
So it is a number type of puzzle game which we'll have in which we have to set the numbers in the sequence

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,340
from like one, two, three, four, five, six, six, seven, eight, nine.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,450
Then we have set the static and count variable as it goes to zero.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,340
Then we have defined the two labels, Albi and Albi two, and there are the long variables before and

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,060
after.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,340
Now we have defined the non parameterized constructor of this class.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,150
Highlight it as puzzle game.

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:59,150
After that, we have defined the label LBW so that it's bound as location to 30, comma 50 and its size

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,650
as one eight across 20.

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,920
After that there is another label limit to its location is as 230 comma 100 and its size as one comma

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,520
20.

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,540
Then for we have defined the button for a label as one and set its location.

19
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,480
Similarly, we have defined the button for the two to its location will be 110, comma 510, sizes 50

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,230
plus 50.

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,670
Similarly for the button three, its location will be 170, comma 50.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,830
Then there is a button null labelled as nothing.

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,760
That's a button.

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,290
Its size will be 50 plus 50 and its location will be 50.

25
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,400
Comma 110.

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,640
Then there is a button five labeled as five.

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,390
Its location.

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,220
110110.

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,330
And its size is 50.

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,170
Comma 50.

31
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,690
After that, there is a button six labeled as six.

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,550
It's bound will be 170, comma 110 and its size will be 50 plus 50.

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,540
Similarly for the button seven, we will be having its size as 50 plus 5000 pounds, 50, comma, 170

34
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,830
and then the button 811011 700 size is 5050.

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,950
After that, we will be there is another button button nine which is labeled as for its bound will be

36
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,040
one 7170 and its size will be 50 cross 50.

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,530
After that, what we are doing, we are adding all of these buttons.

38
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:25,430
Then we are adding these labels and buttons to our frames and setting the size as 400, comma, 400

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,450
and the layout as null and setting the visibility as true.

40
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,800
After that.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,370
What we are doing is we have defined the action, the method by passing the action event object into

42
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:38,700
it.

43
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,700
And if the count is, it goes to zero.

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,740
If the count is close to zero.

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,730
We are stating before it goes to system that current time is.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,190
This will set the current time into the for variable which is of long time.

47
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,280
Then set taxes goes to total clicks.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,920
So in this level we will be showing the total number of clicks which the user will be clicking on to

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,040
change or set the current puzzle to correct them.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,900
A method or a sequence like one, two, three, four, five.

51
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,140
So for that we will be clicking and we'll be showing its total number of clicks.

52
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,690
You have performed well now you don't get resources.

53
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,000
It goes to be one of the resources from B one.

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,000
What we'll be doing is setting the spring label as it goes to be one point get text and if the way to

55
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,610
get text is goes to null, then be two dot set text or we will be setting text off label and we will

56
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,750
not set text or null.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,420
Now if we don't get text as equals to null, what we are doing is setting before the set text label

58
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,130
and be one set text null.

59
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,390
Now if the button resources from V to.

60
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,980
Then we set the label as be to not get text if the people don't get texts.

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,990
So we will set and set text to label and we will be to set external tonal.

62
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,660
If the three don't get text is equals to null, then we will set the better target.

63
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,870
Set text is equals to label and b to null.

64
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,730
So if b five is null, what we are setting b five to the value, setting value to the B five and B two

65
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,330
to null.

66
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,630
Now, if the source of button is from V three, what we are doing is is storing inside the label.

67
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:27,990
Pete.

68
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,760
We get text and.

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,610
If the veto is null, then we will set the value to the B-2 and make the B three null.

70
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,610
If B six is null, then we will set the value to B six and make the B three null.

71
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,020
If the.

72
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,730
Source of the button is from V4.

73
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,720
What we are doing is we are installing a light bulb for point, get text into our existing label.

74
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,210
If we want to get text or DOT equals as equals to null, then we will be doing the one point set text

75
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:00,810
to label.

76
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,830
So we will set the text in the be one equals two label and before the set text to null.

77
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,420
So we'll be making the value of the before as null.

78
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,060
Then v seven dot get text is equal to null.

79
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,780
Set the BB7 set text to label and we make the default set text to NULL.

80
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,270
After that, if I don't get text or equals to null, then if I've not set text as goes to label and

81
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,800
before the set text to null.

82
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:36,000
Similarly, we are doing for the b five is storing the b five dot get text in our string label and then

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,340
if the b two dot get text as equals to null.

84
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,410
We said the bar to set text label and be five set text null if the B4 is null.

85
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,590
We will be setting a value of a string in before and setting the b five as null.

86
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,450
After that, if the b six is null, what we are doing is setting the value in b six and setting the

87
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,560
B five as null.

88
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:02,550
If the B eight is equals to null, we will setting the label in be it and set the text for the B five

89
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,200
as null after that eight point get source is equals two equals to be six.

90
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:15,380
Then what we are doing is a string label is going to be six to get text and be not get texts was to

91
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,980
null.

92
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,000
Then what we are doing is being in set text to label and making the basics null.

93
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:27,150
If b three is null, then we will be b three dot set text as equals to label and b making basics null.

94
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,950
If p five is equals to null, then we will set text label.

95
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:38,570
MI five subtext to label and music starts at Texas Coast Tunnel so why we are doing it's for every button

96
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,100
like whenever we click the button.

97
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,530
So there is only one gap space.

98
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:48,290
It's suppose there are nine or ten values, so there will be one gap space.

99
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,700
So for one gap space, whenever we click on a button, so button, we'll move to that gap.

100
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,530
Space and gap will move to the upper place.

101
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:00,140
So for every button we will be considering all the scenarios and we'll be doing these things like if

102
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,850
B five dot text is null whenever the button b six is pressed.

103
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,910
So if the button V six is pressed and V five is null.

104
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,640
So what we are doing is setting the B five label.

105
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,140
So where we will be finding the null will be placing that button six to there.

106
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,600
So what we are doing is setting the B five point set text label so the base value of the B six will

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,090
be placed in in the place of the B five.

108
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,610
And what we are doing is making the B six null.

109
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,330
So because the value of basics have been moved to the B five and so now the null value containing button

110
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,290
must be six.

111
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,600
So this is how we are considering all the scenarios for that particular puzzle.

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,740
Similarly we are doing for the button salmon as well is turning its value into the label and before

113
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,370
dot get text is close to nulls.

114
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,690
If v4 is null then we will be storing the value of the B7 and V four and making the B seminal.

115
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:57,250
If B eight is null, then we'll be storing the value of B7 to be it and making the B seminal.

116
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,960
Similarly for the B eight.

117
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:04,490
What we are doing is is storing the value of b it in label and if the B9 is null, then will restore

118
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,700
the value of b it in re nine and set the B8 as null.

119
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,170
Similarly, if the B7 is null, then we'll set the value of B8 in b7 make the B8 null.

120
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,720
If the B5 is null, then we set the value of B.

121
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,060
Five said the value of B five, sorry, b a to B five and B eight as null.

122
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:30,050
So if the get resources from B nine, what we are doing is storing into the IT label and if B6 do not

123
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:38,270
get taxed as equals to null, then we will be set b six to the value of the B9 and make the B9 to null.

124
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:45,680
After that, if we don't get taxed as equals to null, so we'll be setting b eight to the value of the

125
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,720
B9 and make the B9 as null.

126
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,090
After.

127
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,390
So this is the after valuable in the before variable we have stored.

128
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,810
Let me see you.

129
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,560
So this is before is equals to system not current mills.

130
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:09,570
So this will show the current time in store in the current before variable and after the completion

131
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,490
of any one of these operations inside.

132
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,220
If a statement what we are doing is after this goes to system current mills so this will again store

133
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,870
the current time in the after variable.

134
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
Now long second is close to after minus before four divided by thousand.

135
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,210
This will be calculating the seconds and LP two point set text.

136
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:33,060
So in the label to we will be showing the time which you will the user will be using to complete this

137
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,570
puzzle.

138
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,870
Now if we want to get taxed as equals to one two.

139
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,070
So this is the correct format.

140
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,370
So inside the basement we must have one in.

141
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:53,130
We two must have two in b three must have three B for must have 4b5, 5p6, 6b7, seven, b eight,

142
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,510
eight and b99.

143
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,020
So this must be the correct format.

144
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,350
And inside the B nine, we must have null value.

145
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,370
So this for this current format, if we found that correct format.

146
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:12,030
So what we are doing is we are showing the dialog box like congratulation you want and we will show

147
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,340
that Total Clicks which will be stored in the count variable and the total time in seconds which we

148
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,620
have stored in our second variable.

149
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,320
After that we will make the count as close to zero before it goes to zero and after as it goes to zero.

150
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,100
Now inside the public static void main, we have called our new puzzle.

151
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,680
Uh, glass.

152
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,340
And so this is all about our puzzle class, which will be a number puzzle game to set the numbers in

153
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,680
the required format and desired format.

154
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,020
That is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

155
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,600
So this is all about from.
