00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,870
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:09,690
So in the previous part, we have looked up to all the objects which were declared in the class label

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:21,570
and as an extension to this class, we have extended this as different as we have to set a frame, layout,

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:29,970
size, location and everything will be attached to the frame and the frame is going to be like added

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,630
with the help of this Java showing frame import which we have already imported.

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,190
So this class has extended to the frame and which is going to implement action listener.

7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:52,440
So action listeners are going to be attached with all the buttons and labels that are embedded in this

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,070
application.

9
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,940
We can see that we have buttons, we have radio buttons, we have a check box and everything.

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:07,680
So these are all are going to be made functional with the help of action list, not implementation.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,270
Okay.

12
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,960
So we have already made extension as the frame and implemented the action listener.

13
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:23,610
So to implement this action, we have to call this override for like this is a function public word

14
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:32,010
action for font is the name of function which we have to declare like as a necessity in order to implement

15
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,500
this action is not our main class.

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,740
So this override is basically overriding one function over other.

17
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,870
So this is our main function.

18
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:50,010
And to attach actions to it, we have to write our program inside this action performed function.

19
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:56,070
And the argument is going to be E which is event performed with each action.

20
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,820
So that is the event and every event is attached with a function or action.

21
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,470
We can say it anyways.

22
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,900
So yes, we have made everything like clear till now.

23
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:16,800
We have set the size of the frame, we have set location, we have said the title.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,460
Okay, so we can set title according to our choices.

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,940
Like here we have order as our project title.

26
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,620
We can set it anyways.

27
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,970
So suppose I want to set it as food ordering.

28
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,170
System.

29
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,440
To make things like more appropriate.

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,530
So I changed that title for our application.

31
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,910
Now to initialize this application, we have to make a dedicated function inside this label class as

32
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,500
well.

33
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:58,770
So let me first initialize this image to make the error vanish.

34
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:07,650
So it is going to be a public void function of course, and inside this init function.

35
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,620
So you can see that the error has vanished.

36
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:19,170
Now inside this init function I am going to initialize like we have what we have on the top.

37
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,150
So we have select size or like label on the top.

38
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:34,300
So firstly we have to initialize it label size and it is going to be a new jailable.

39
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,000
Jailable label is also a component of the Java String Library.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:49,290
So the new label is going to be the new object and the like.

41
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:57,870
Text inside it is going to be select size, select size of what we want to order.

42
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,760
And there are three options.

43
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,520
We have discussed it already.

44
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,740
So a label that labels the combo box.

45
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,170
So we have a label to our combo box.

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,100
Now we have to set a size for this again.

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:24,030
So we have to like similar where we have to label size dot set size as we have done here for our main

48
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,750
label.

49
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:33,360
So dot set size and dot set select location is going to be attached here in a similar way.

50
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,420
So we have successfully set data size for the select size combo box.

51
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:48,210
And a location like that is it has to be located on the window, which is going to be the application

52
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,050
main window.

53
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,970
And similarly we have added this label size to our frame.

54
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,530
So in order to add everything to our frame, we have to do this.

55
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:05,040
Every method is going to be added to the frame with the help of this add keyword.

56
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:18,030
So we have created this size thing and now the next step should be like adding inputs to the combo box.

57
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,570
So string inputs are going to be added for sizes.

58
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,850
So the sizes are we are three sizes option, I think.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,790
So they are small.

60
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,890
Medium.

61
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,310
At large as far as I can see that.

62
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:50,160
So we have to like name all the sizes option inside this string sizes thing.

63
00:05:50,160 --> 00:06:00,780
And now after adding names to the sizes in the next step, we have to in the similar way, set size

64
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,600
and set location and then add this thing to the frame also.

65
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,120
So these drinks are going to be consistent inside the combo box like you can see it.

66
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,110
This is a combo box component.

67
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,340
And inside this we are having springs, small, medium and large as the sizes of the menu items.

68
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:33,710
Now size dot select index is set to zero like the argument inside the select index is set to zero.

69
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:44,750
This means that by default the size is going to be small, so that should be a default size to the items

70
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,770
that should be open.

71
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:53,300
Like this is the opening window of the application and by default it is showing small in select size

72
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,290
combo box.

73
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,550
So this is responsible for that thing only.

74
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,800
So size do not select index.

75
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,030
So index is zero.

76
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,960
We have 3012 indexes for small, medium and large.

77
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:16,550
Basically this is a string area we call it is a collection of like events, inputs, strings, integers,

78
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,560
doubles, longs and everything.

79
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:27,290
So we have string array and it is going to contain zero one and two indexes small has index zero.

80
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,530
So this is set to default as small.

81
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,720
Now this is the size of the combo box location of the combo box.

82
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,980
And at last we have added the size to the frame.

83
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:48,290
So I have already discussed it that this is responsible for adding everything to the frame of the application.

84
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,530
Now we have successfully added this select size label in our frame.

85
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:02,540
As a next step, we have to add this select which type of beverage you want to order and after which

86
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,390
are like radial button options label is to be added to our frame.

87
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:20,150
So our next concern should be adding a label, which is going to be a label, of course, and this label

88
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:33,740
is going to contain a string which is asking for select that type of like drink you want to order,

89
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,060
so type of drink you want to order.

90
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,260
And this is going to be a label added to our frame and a colon.

91
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:55,310
So this is the label and or similar way we have to set the size for this label and location also.

92
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,900
So we have added a title to the label.

93
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:08,930
A size is set for the label and a location is set for the label that where it should be located on the

94
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,710
window.

95
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,080
So head this is located.

96
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,470
This is 100 from top and from the left it is 75.

97
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,930
This is the size layout.

98
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,410
Also, we have added this to the frame with the help of add keyword.

99
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:37,550
Now our next concern should be creating radial buttons and we are going to import our group object which

100
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,610
we have like declared already globally.

101
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,100
So we have.

102
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,350
Successfully called our BETAINE Group here.

103
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,860
We have declared this group as a private global variable.

104
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:02,540
Now our next step should be adding items to the radio buttons.

105
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:15,530
So like, suppose we are adding radio drink juice and calling it as our juice and we are going to add

106
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,280
a new.

107
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,860
Radio button.

108
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:29,700
So that frame and the string should be added as argument, which is going to display the items beside

109
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:37,170
the menu button, like the button and the name of the item should be displayed side by side.

110
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:43,440
So we have successfully created our first radio button.

111
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,310
Now set the size for it as well.

112
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:55,770
So our deduce at size dot set size is going to set the size.

113
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,120
And suppose we are setting it as 75.

114
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,730
Trauma 50.

115
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,420
So this is going to be the size of the radio button in the similar way.

116
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,770
We have to set a location and add this radio button to the frame.

117
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,530
Now, in this similar way, we have to add three more items to the menu.

118
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:31,110
So I am copying the same thing three more times in order to delete things one by one.

119
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,320
So the second item is suppose what the third one is.

120
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,450
So P and the fourth one is coffee.

121
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,630
So yes, just rename this everywhere.

122
00:11:50,450 --> 00:12:00,140
And now after renaming every, like, the radio button and setting a unique location, a dedicated location

123
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:06,230
for every radio button, the size of the radio button is going to be same, but the location should

124
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,770
change.

125
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:17,500
Like from top, it is going to be one 110, but from left it is going to shift some like how many pixels

126
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,780
we are shifting it.

127
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,290
Suppose you have 100, then 175, then 250, then 325.

128
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:32,480
So initially we have this distance has 100, then 175, then 200 and then 325.

129
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,720
So this is the location of these buttons from the frame's left to border.

130
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:47,990
Okay, so now for as far as I can see, that we have created the frame items still here.

131
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:54,530
Now, our next concern should be to add these radio buttons to the frame.

132
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:04,280
So our next concern is that only to let us try to add, okay, so we have added all the buttons to the

133
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:12,200
frame with the help of these ten group objects and we have declared this meeting group head.

134
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,470
Okay, so we have declared this.

135
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,290
Hair also.

136
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,920
Yes.

137
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:25,480
So this button group is the name of the component which we are using from the library package.

138
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,660
Swing and in group is the name of the object.

139
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:34,120
So we are adding everything to the frame with the help of these B10 group keyword.

140
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Also, our next label asks for how many glasses of the specific item we want to order.

141
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,650
So in this similar way, we have created a G label.

142
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:55,960
Here we are creating a label for glasses also and asking how many glasses you want to order inside the

143
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:04,600
label bracket in a form of a string, setting a size for the label and location for the label from the

144
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,080
frame like top and left border and adding this LP l glass to the frame.

145
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:20,920
Also a text box is added which is going to take input as how many glasses we want to order.

146
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:29,560
Like this box is responsible for that and we have also set the size and location for that box also.

147
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:39,370
So till now we have covered everything for select size and the type of item we want to order from the

148
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,390
menu as radio buttons and number of glasses.

149
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,860
We want to order as we have covered this thing.

150
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,030
Now in the next part we will be covering the button parts like how to add buttons and how to make them
