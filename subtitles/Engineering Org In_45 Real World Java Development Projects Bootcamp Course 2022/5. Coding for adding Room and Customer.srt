1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,700
So here is the ad from Java class.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,540
And that is defined inside the package hotel.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,310
And we have imported the necessary packages.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:17,500
Java eight Abstract Toolkit Swing Swing Border Abstract Toolkit DOT Event as well.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,140
Package and Util Package.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,760
Then we have defined the class add room using extend, which is extending frame and implementing actions.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:33,270
Now a private panel type of variable that is content pane for text field 22 to 34 for combo box combo

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,150
box combo box one combo box to box three, b1, b2 and one.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,230
Choice type of variable inside the main function we have.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,980
Initialize the object by setting its visibility as true.

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,260
There is a non parameter constructor of this class setting the bound for it and adding that content

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,140
pane, initializing the panel, setting that j panel to the frame and adding its layout as null.

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,270
There is the image icon adding that image anchor icon to our frame and then as another label as add

14
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:08,810
room.

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,290
Setting it bonds, setting the bond for it, adding that to our window adding that to actually it is

16
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,130
a panel content pane is a panel here so adding it to our panel.

17
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:27,750
Then there is another label as room number setting the foreground color of it, found type family and

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,280
size of it, and bound for the font, bound for the room number label and adding that label to our panel.

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,170
Then there's a text field adding that, setting the bound for the text field and adding it, adding

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,400
it to our panel.

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,310
Uh, yes.

22
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,560
And then we have another label which is labeled as availability, setting the foreground of it, font

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,280
of it, setting the bound for it, and adding that to our panel.

24
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,370
Then there is a combo works which have to a string type which is available or occupied.

25
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:06,210
So as it is a add room class, it will be used to adding rooms so room status can be either available

26
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,630
or it can be occupied.

27
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,780
So setting the bound for combo box, adding that combo box to our panel and the label L three, which

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,980
is cleaning the status.

29
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,100
So foreground color for it, font type of it and bound setting the bound for the location of it in that

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,230
window and adding that to our panel.

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,280
Next to the combo box for the cleaning stated either that room can be in clean status or dirty status.

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,750
So we are using the combo box.

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,210
So combo box setting the bond for the combo box and adding that combo box to our panel.

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,650
Next is the price.

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,940
What is the price of the room?

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:46,030
For that, we have set the foreground color of that label, font type family and size of that label,

37
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,310
setting the bound for it and adding that to our panel.

38
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:55,570
Now respective text field of the price setting the bound for the text field and adding the to our contain

39
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,860
panel.

40
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,670
Next label is a bed type, so bed type will be also off either single bed on double bed.

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,050
So first setting its foreground color, setting the font type family and its size, setting the bound

42
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,450
for it and adding that content panel.

43
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,160
Adding that label to our panel.

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,830
Next is combo box three.

45
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,810
Which is a.

46
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,370
Dating to a loose string single or double wide in respect of BET type, setting the band for it and

47
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,730
adding that to our panel.

48
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,370
Next is a be one button which is added.

49
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:38,000
So this will execute the event of adding that room to our database, adding the action list and setting

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,620
the bound for it, adding background color and foreground color, then adding it to our panel.

51
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,490
Next button.

52
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,480
Another button is back doing the same thing for that button as well.

53
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,330
At last, setting the background colour of the window as white.

54
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,220
Now inside action performed event.

55
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,170
If the source of event is from Demon Button, then we will initialize the connection with the database

56
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:08,800
by using our icon class and retrieve the information of room available status price and type with the

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,280
respective text field and combo box of them.

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,540
And then we will.

59
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,140
We have created a query string SDR insert into room values room plus available status, price and type.

60
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:29,140
Then we have executed those query by using the connection and the statement objects of our class displayed

61
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,800
a.

62
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:37,010
NASA's dialog box, which states, as Roome successfully added, then setting as visibility as false

63
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,950
catch block will handle the exception if the source from way to then will close this window by setting

64
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,120
as visibility as false.

65
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,850
Let's move to the new customer dot java class.

66
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,120
This is defined inside the package hotel, adding the necessary packages.

67
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,010
Then we have defined the class, which is a stack standing frame.

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,590
Initialize the connection object as null, as prepared a statement as null and a content panel g.

69
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,860
Panel six Text Field A Combo Box two radio buttons and a choice for launching the application.

70
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,350
Inside the main function, we have invoked a new enabled void run method and inside the try function

71
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,780
we have initialize the constructor of the current class.

72
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,920
Setting the visibility of the frame as to catch will end any section.

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,910
If occurs, then public new customer throws collapse action.

74
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,010
We have defined the non parameterized constructor which will throw the exception if any occurs.

75
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,290
Setting the ground floor for the window.

76
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,300
Initializing the panel setting.

77
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,180
Adding the Japan to our frame and setting its layout as null adding image.

78
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,090
To our DJ friend window.

79
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:01,490
Then we have a new label as new customer forum for one type of it, adding the bond and it's.

80
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,670
Adding it to our panel.

81
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,690
Then there is an ID label setting the bound for it, adding to our panel.

82
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,150
Then there is a combo box which shows passport, AADHAAR, card, voter I.D. or driver's license.

83
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,460
So ID can be selected as either passport Aadhaar card, voter I.D. or driving license of the.

84
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,180
Customer setting the bound for the combo box and adding that combo box to a panel.

85
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,920
Next is a label that is number.

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,560
So number is is respect of the ID.

87
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,690
That number can be of passport number R number voter I.D. number or driving license number setting bound

88
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,890
for it, adding it to.

89
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:42,260
And in respect of the number, we have its text field as well that is setting the bound for it, adding

90
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:49,700
that to our panel and set columns for it that should not exceed ten, I think, and then label and address,

91
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,130
name, name of the employer setting bound for it, adding that to our panel that's for the name respect

92
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,240
to text field setting bound, adding it to a panel, setting its columns.

93
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,670
Then there is a gender for gender.

94
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,110
We have a radio buttons.

95
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:09,830
First is male setting bound for it and background color for it and bound for it.

96
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,390
Adding it to a panel.

97
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,840
Similarly, a female radio button so that gender can be either female or male.

98
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,320
Then we have country, so country will have a respective text field country.

99
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,990
Then that is a country adding that country to our.

100
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,990
Panel.

101
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,290
Then there is an allocated room number for the new customer that we have added to our panel.

102
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,750
After that, there is ac1 of choice new.

103
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,100
So if inside the dialog we have initiated the connection results that select abstract from room while

104
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,550
our start next will iterate over the rows of the that.

105
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,010
Database and even add RSS numbers.

106
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,080
It will add.

107
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,490
Room number in that choice object, which we have created here, that is seven.

108
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,580
And then we have set the bond for this event and adding that to our panel.

109
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,950
Then there is a label checked and.

110
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,870
And there is a label deposit we have setting bond and added both to our panel.

111
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,620
Then there is a text field.

112
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:26,340
Respective for the above fields, setting bond for it, adding content panel to it, adding it to our

113
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,110
panel, setting the column for it.

114
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,320
Another text field setting bound for it column.

115
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,390
Adding it to our panel and column.

116
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,030
Similarly, there is another 36 text field.

117
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,120
Now there is a button add for which we have added action listener and action performed defined action

118
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,290
performed method.

119
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,480
So on initializing the connection with the database and setting the radio string to null.

120
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,280
So our one dot is selected.

121
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,360
If our one selected then we will set radio as male.

122
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,850
If our to select it, then we will set radio as female in a string as six.

123
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,770
We have retrieved the item from the choice inside the drive log.

124
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:11,580
We have retrieve item from the respective fields, column box, text fields and radio buttons, and

125
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,910
we have created to insert customer values.

126
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,470
To insert customer values.

127
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,410
There is a Cuban query and to obtain room set availability.

128
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,060
We has qq2 query.

129
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:29,380
We have updated executed both query by using as one or as connection statement objects.

130
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,810
Then we have showed the dialog box and visibility of the new reception as true and setting the visibility

131
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,220
of the current as false.

132
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,690
After that, there is a button setting the bound for the button, for running the background color,

133
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,000
adding a red button to our panel.

134
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,850
Then there's the exit bag button inside which we have setting the visibility of the reception class

135
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:51,730
as to and other current last falls, setting the bound for the buttons and adding to them.

136
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,680
At last we have setting the background color of the current window as white.

137
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,350
So let's move to the last class of this video that is a room defined inside the package hotel.

138
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,430
We have imported the necessary packages for this class.

139
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,800
This class is extending frame.

140
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,990
Connection object as a null j panelists content beam AJ Table.

141
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:23,960
AJ There are one two, three, four, five, six labels in this class and there's a non constructor

142
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:31,460
setting default frame and it's bound, creating a new panel, setting the bottle for it, setting its

143
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:38,480
content layout, adding image to the frame, initializing that table and its bounds.

144
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,320
Then there is a button to load data button labelled as load data.

145
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,870
If this method is for.

146
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,580
Performing event on this button.

147
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:58,690
So whenever load data is pressed or clicked, so it will select extract data from room and execute that

148
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:04,570
query with the help of results set and table set model, we will set the model of the table by using

149
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,650
this statement.

150
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,940
Next, setting the button for the button and background, foreground color and adding to our panel.

151
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,860
There is a back button as well, so adding its accent listener.

152
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:26,230
So it will just move us back to the reception window and set the current visibility as false, adding

153
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,420
back buttons, bound background color, foreground color and adding to our panel.

154
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:38,200
Then there is another label labeled as label availability, setting it bounce and adding to our panel.

155
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,190
Then the clean status and its price.

156
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,210
Then there is a bed type and a room number type of label.

157
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:56,150
Setting the whole background color of the window as white background color long for launching the application.

158
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:02,240
Here is the new invoke little new enabled method defined inside the public void main method which will

159
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,250
create the object of the current class and set the visibility of the frame as true.

160
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,220
So this is all about the three classes let.

161
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,520
See how these classes are running.

162
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,640
What will be the output of these classes?

163
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,530
So let's run a bedroom class first.

164
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,870
We will run this file.

165
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,560
It will look like this.

166
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,460
This is actually defined inside the admin menu bar of our dashboard class.

167
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,860
So this is the add room window.

168
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:40,210
Then if we run our new customer window on this file, it will look like this.

169
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,040
That is a new customer forum.

170
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,560
This is how it looks.

171
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,370
And that room door java file.

172
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,010
Let's run this one also.

173
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,260
So this is how it will look.
