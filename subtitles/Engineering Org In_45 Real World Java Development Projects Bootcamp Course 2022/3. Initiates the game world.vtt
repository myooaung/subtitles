1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.360
Now we will create a method which will initiate the game.

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:16.360
So here I will take a class constructor after this and I will write here public name.

3
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:24.980
It is the same as close parentheses and here I will take that matter.

4
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.570
Name, initial, bold and not now we will create this matter.

5
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.450
Created method.

6
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.870
Initial Bold.

7
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.400
So here, this matter initiates the game.

8
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.460
It goes through the lemon string and fills the mentioned list, which I will create here.

9
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.970
Firstly, what do we have to do?

10
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.740
We will create a key listener here.

11
00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:05.000
So I will write and key listener and give the parameter with the adapter here.

12
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.950
The adapter.

13
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.700
Next thing you need said focus able.

14
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.150
Boolean character set to the true here.

15
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.660
And next which we have.

16
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.360
The initial world which will create.

17
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.180
The Game board.

18
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.560
Okay.

19
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.770
So now what we have to do in this matter.

20
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.560
Can.

21
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.140
Create Class Director.

22
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.580
Okay, we have we will create it afterwards.

23
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.370
Firstly, what we will do, we will take the word and the height of the board first here.

24
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:21.700
So we will write here some getter and name it as the board word.

25
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:35.140
So here I will take public int get board foot and under this I will return the store w which we have

26
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.100
created.

27
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.530
Next one which we have to create is the height similar to the previous one.

28
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.820
So I will write public and get board height here.

29
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.240
Under this I will right return the stored edge.

30
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.310
This is done.

31
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.160
Now we have to write the body of this game world.

32
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.380
Here it will initiate to the game world mainly.

33
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.690
Here I will firstly created some string level and fill it.

34
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:20.860
So we need once equal to new ArrayList here.

35
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.240
Done.

36
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.580
Okay.

37
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.160
Next thing which we have the bags equal to new ArrayList here.

38
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.260
The next last one is the areas.

39
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.670
Write it to the ArrayList here and the next one will be the X.

40
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.130
Set it to the offset here will be the y coordinate with offset.

41
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.980
Okay.

42
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.820
So the offset is done.

43
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.830
It goes through the level strings and fill the above.

44
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.430
Fill this above mentioned list.

45
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.340
Now what we have to do next thing, which we have to do, we need some keys.

46
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.410
Firstly, we have to treat through that.

47
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.650
So what we have to do here, I will write.

48
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.060
Here.

49
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.900
Okay.

50
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.170
So here I will write.

51
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.570
Take the one wall.

52
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.550
Next thing which you need the baggage be.

53
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.170
These are the local variable here, the area here.

54
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.790
And.

55
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.570
Here.

56
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:55.420
I will write for loop under this I will write in equal to zero here and I should be less than with the

57
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.070
level length.

58
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.180
We need the length here and it should be increment of i.

59
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.530
I plus.

60
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.250
Plus.

61
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.780
No.

62
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.090
This.

63
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.270
What do we have to do?

64
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.510
We need to get rid of the item.

65
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.780
Character of the item variable.

66
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.670
So here I will take the level.

67
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.050
Not near the carrot.

68
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.950
With the next.

69
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.100
I am done.

70
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.610
Now here I will take the switch to switch on.

71
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.230
Here I will give the variable item.

72
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.880
And under this, I will make some cases.

73
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.390
So first case will be the.

74
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.080
Changing of rule.

75
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:56.600
So under this I will mention slash on this case will be the y plus equal to these.

76
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.340
No need to check if the store W is less than two x.

77
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.000
If not, the store W will reset to the x.

78
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.310
Here.

79
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.090
The next case will be.

80
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:28.250
After that, we have to initial side X with the offset variable here and next thing it will do.

81
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.760
And so the next case which we need here.

82
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.320
Okay.

83
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.760
Here, I will need a case with this hash.

84
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.550
Here on Cologne.

85
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:58.070
Here I will say the one equal to new role here with the x comma y.

86
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.770
Indeed, the false start ad is one.

87
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.340
Right X plus equal to space.

88
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.270
And just to break this loop here.

89
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.230
Okay.

90
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.280
Okay.

91
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.710
I have to match this arguments also.

92
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.900
Okay, just a minute.

93
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.750
Firstly, we will then and create all our cases here.

94
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.180
So take the case.

95
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.000
And here I will be equal to new baggage.

96
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:52.560
Under this, I will give X, comma, y, Cardi B, x or y.

97
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.650
Thinks Come on why barometer or the arguments here.

98
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.180
And just write back start.

99
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.860
And.

100
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.450
Me be.

101
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.140
Be here x plus equal to space.

102
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.960
I'll just take.

103
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:30.870
Now we have to take another case of dirt here.

104
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:40.740
Cologne said the area is equal to new area here and just x comma y here.

105
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:50.670
Need areas not add a then x plus equal to space.

106
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.720
Next thing which we will do break here and the other case which we have as the.

107
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.240
So one player.

108
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:10.050
So here I will write case after it which will represent the so one player here.

109
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:17.460
Here I will write so qu equal to new player and notice.

110
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.360
We'll give the argument X, comma, y, and just x.

111
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.620
Okay.

112
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.600
Know, I really tried.

113
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:42.310
X plus equal to space and none near the break.

114
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.210
Next condition which we have to empty space here.

115
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.290
So just leave it empty and colon.

116
00:09:53.830 --> 00:10:00.430
Under this what we have to do, we will write X plus equal to space here.

117
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:10.540
And after that, we'll just write break and all the cases are done.

118
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.710
Now we need to default.

119
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.190
Case here.

120
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.810
Mention the default case.

121
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.080
It just break the body here and here.

122
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.600
After that, we need actually equal to y.

123
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.290
Okay.

124
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.030
So.

125
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.220
I chicken too.

126
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.140
Why here?

127
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.070
So this part done.

128
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.820
Now, after that, what do we have to do here?

129
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.740
We create a world list.

130
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.830
Okay, so we already created that.

131
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.580
So what we can do?

132
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.260
We already have the initial word material.

133
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:00.040
Okay.

134
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:06.310
Which will initiate the game world and it will go through the level string and fills the list.

135
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:16.720
Next thing, which we had in case of here, in the case of our character, we create a baggage object.

136
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.470
The object is appended to the bags list.

137
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.430
The x variable is increased accordingly.

138
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.740
So same thing is goes with this on here.

139
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.210
The hash character.

140
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.750
We create a foreign object here.

141
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:41.110
The object is appended to the list and the x variable is increased accordingly.

142
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.440
Same goes with no here not.

143
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.060
Same goes with the so called one player.

144
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.720
We created a called object to the object appended to.

145
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.440
No.

146
00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:01.240
Here the this object will not only we have created the circle player object here and it will just increase

147
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.860
accordingly with the x.

148
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.880
Now what we have to do, we will do one more thing.

149
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:12.100
We will create a wild, wild matter which will grow the game world on the window.

150
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:20.500
So here, after this, we will create a private void.

151
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.450
Build one.

152
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.550
And give the.
