1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,480
Private one line down, which we have seen in the previous.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:15,180
We have the fallen Tetris piece and we finishes the falling and the piece dropped is called So here

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:25,200
we will create the matter one line down and name and then create parent curly bracket.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:37,080
And here we will provide some condition with if is not try move with the piece.

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,460
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,150
X, comma y.

7
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,210
These are the current hold ups and minus one sided to the minus one.

8
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,030
And under this we will call that matter piece dropped here.

9
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,830
So it's done.

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,580
It's done.

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,340
And now we have to clear the board also.

12
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,340
So we.

13
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,950
Okay, we have already done just a second here.

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,970
We have to write the body as well here.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,620
So what we will do, I think in the one I don't matter, we are trying to move the following piece down

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,070
one line until it is fully dropped.

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,980
So, so clear.

18
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,760
More matter.

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,920
First, we have to work with the clear board method and here we will write.

20
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,630
Just a second.

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,460
We will do we will write here a word loop.

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,370
A clear board method fills the board with empty terminal no ship.

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,190
This will later use collision detection.

24
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,100
So here we need the for loop.

25
00:01:52,490 --> 00:02:01,010
We write int I equal to zero and I is less than to board.

26
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,930
We need the board height which is multiplied by the board width.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,950
Do the posting element of I and it's done.

28
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:23,120
And under this we will set the Iot index to the equal do that drum that to me no doubt no shape.

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,680
This is right now we have to write the body of the peace drop method as well.

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,150
So here we will do the piece.

31
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,210
Drop method puts the following piece into the border.

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,810
So once again, the board holds on the squares of the pieces and remains the pieces that has finished

33
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,430
falling.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,550
So when the piece has finished falling, it is time to check if we can remove some lines of the board

35
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,470
or not.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,690
So this is the job of the remove fool.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,940
Okay, so we have to read full, full lines, right?

38
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,390
So we will create another matter and limit as the remove lines.

39
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:12,370
Then we create a new piece or more precisely, we try to create a new piece under this.

40
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,520
What do we have to do?

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:27,220
We will write for an equal to zero and I should be less than two four and do the increment of the AI.

42
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:36,500
And under this we will write in x equal to call it to x plus plus piece.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Sorry, good piece and set it to dot x and provide a similar to that.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,010
And y or y.

45
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,350
And here we will not add up.

46
00:03:52,350 --> 00:04:00,420
We will subtract the current piece or divide and provide it to the index.

47
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,880
Okay, so this is done.

48
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:16,650
We have to write one more thing board and here we have to write y multiplied by board word and it will

49
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,450
be add up with the x.

50
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:26,730
It should be go with the current piece, not get shape method.

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,330
Okay.

52
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,540
This thing is done and we have to create another method.

53
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,030
Remove the second.

54
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,320
Remove full line.

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,460
So we will name it as remove full lines.

56
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,930
This is done.

57
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,590
And we will create we will see this its body afterwards and here what we will do.

58
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,750
We have to check one condition.

59
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,960
So we write if is not following.

60
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,220
No falling.

61
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,030
Finished.

62
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,060
So this.

63
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,270
We have to create a new piece.

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,560
This one.

65
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,020
So once again, I will explain.

66
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,760
Now, please draw method puts the following piece into the border.

67
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,450
So once again, the board holds all the squares of the pieces and remains the pieces that has finished

68
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,080
falling.

69
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:30,670
When the piece has finished falling, it is time to check if we can remove some lines on the wall.

70
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,240
And this is the job of the remove lines matter.

71
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,910
Then we created a new piece.

72
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,440
Or more precisely, we are trying to create a new piece here.

73
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,450
So in this map, a new piece.

74
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,750
What we have to write.

75
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,400
We have to write.

76
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,010
It's creating a new Tetris piece.

77
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,180
The piece gets a new random shape.

78
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:03,090
So then we have to compute the initial current X and the current Y values so we cannot move to the initial

79
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,930
positions.

80
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,840
The game is over the top out.

81
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,880
The timer is the and we display game over string containing the score on the status bar.

82
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,150
So what we will do, we will do.

83
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,160
I think.

84
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,450
Okay, so we have to set the current PS current.

85
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,970
We start set random trip.

86
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:38,130
This is done and we need current X and set it to the board width and divided by two and a total of one.

87
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,880
Sorry.

88
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,310
Add it to the one and semicolon.

89
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,270
And then what?

90
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,410
We will do the current y and set it to the board.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,750
Height, I think height and subtracted to the minus one add of the current piece.

92
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,120
Greenpeace start, we need the minimum out y.

93
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,290
Okay, so this is also done.

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,220
So new bass method creates a new Tetris piece here and it's all done.

95
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,290
Now what we have to do, we have to decide the random.

96
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,410
No, we have to.

97
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,720
Firstly, only we have compute the initial current X in the current Y values.

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
But if we cannot move to the initial position, the game is over.

99
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,540
We drop out.

100
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,590
So we have to function the timer as well.

101
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,410
The timer is drop and we display game over string containing the score on the status bar.

102
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,230
So what we will do next, we will write.

103
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,110
Here, if not equal to try move on here.

104
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:00,730
We will provide the current piece and comma index comma.

105
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,170
Right.

106
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:15,010
And here would set it to the parentheses and read current piece with dot set shape and we check the

107
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,940
terminal.

108
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,560
Listen.

109
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,950
So that through me?

110
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,240
No, not no shape.

111
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,090
After this, the timer has to stop.

112
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,140
Here.

113
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,870
This one.

114
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:40,650
This thing is done and we have to display game over string containing the score on the status bar.

115
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,020
Okay.

116
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:48,750
So here we need the variable message and we have to write.

117
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,600
String we need.

118
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,950
It's not all.

119
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,740
I think it starts from the echo.

120
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah.

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,740
This one.

122
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,950
The format here we will write.

123
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,310
Came over and we need.

124
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,620
Score, which is your percentage?

125
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,960
DX This is done and here what we will do, we will do.

126
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,480
We will call the lines removed.

127
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,400
So here done.

128
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,440
And we have to score on the status word, right?

129
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,010
So here we will write status but not set text.

130
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,940
And we didn't write the message here.

131
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,120
So here these things are done and now we have to go to the tribal matter as well.

132
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,790
So here we have to write other things.

133
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,630
Firstly, we have to change the parameters.

134
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,070
It should be new piece.

135
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,960
We need the new piece.

136
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,500
Right.

137
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,030
The Prime move matter tries to move the Tetris piece.

138
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,370
The matter returns the false if it has reached the board boundaries or it is adjacent to the already

139
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,970
fallen Tetris pieces.

140
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:29,080
So here we need a new piece and it is set to the new X and it should reset it to the new Y.

141
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,700
Listen here.

142
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,160
We will do need a for loop here.

143
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,600
We need an eye equal to zero.

144
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,140
And I should be less than four.

145
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,970
And I plus.

146
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:57,530
Plus in this we need x equal to new x plus.

147
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:05,870
Newbies not ex with I am similar to this.

148
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,790
And why do new I.

149
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,000
Sorry.

150
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,210
Sorry.

151
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,760
It should be subtracted with the new piece so not why.

152
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,050
And give it to the eye and done.

153
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,360
And it should be at my mistake.

154
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,970
It should be add and its turn.

155
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:36,200
Now we have to change the conditions so we will write if X is less than two zero.

156
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,490
No.

157
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,650
You need some binary processing arithmetic operations here.

158
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:56,560
So here we have to write good word for word, and then this one, and then we have to set.

159
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,130
Why is less than zero this one?

160
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,770
Then why should we greater equal to good height?

161
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:13,610
I think we have good height and then we should go and return false here.

162
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,910
And another condition will be if she bad.

163
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:23,810
Here.

164
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,750
The shape and X should be the same.

165
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,420
And it should not be.

166
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:38,420
Be equal to that terminal or no shape here.

167
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,280
And under this condition, we should return.

168
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,180
False.

169
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,940
This is done.

170
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,360
And after this, we has to write.

171
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,250
We have to set the current piece to the new piece here.

172
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:04,760
So we will write current piece equal to new piece and done current x.

173
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,290
Equal to new X.

174
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:19,310
The current Y equals the new Y, and these are done and we have to repaint.

175
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,140
So we will call the method repaint and we have to return.

176
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,830
And it.

177
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,640
Now what we have to do.

178
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,500
We have to write the body of this matter.
