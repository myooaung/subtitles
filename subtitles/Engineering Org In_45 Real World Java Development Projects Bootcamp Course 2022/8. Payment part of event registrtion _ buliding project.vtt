WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.040
So in other cases, I told you how we can create a event and everything.

2
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.450
So now I will go with some fast methods.

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.450
I'm going to tell you.

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:18.370
So for these end our completely and for the admin part for the creation of event and everything inside

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.730
this, I'm going to deploy all things as I told you.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.590
So first, we need to create one registration of our participants.

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.000
First I'm going to create one HTML register in HTML.

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.780
So as I told you, the in the partnership participants event, there is one view event also.

9
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.720
So let us deal with the view event for I don't want to go to the HTML part.

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.470
I want to display everything inside the Java only.

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.330
I'm going to create every form of starting HTML tag with the ending of the body tag.

12
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.360
I want to create display the HTML page through the Java only.

13
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.300
For that purpose I'm going to create one servlet view event.

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.200
One html.

15
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.040
Oh sorry.

16
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.050
Event one dot java.

17
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.690
For that purpose, I created this subnet.

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.710
So after this, I told you.

19
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.440
I already told you how we can go with this.

20
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.590
So for this purpose, you can go in with this part first, outdoor, out-of-print, and then everything.

21
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.030
And with the body.

22
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.370
So you can create in one single tag also like plus and then concatenate all the strings inside one statement.

23
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.940
But for the simplicity, I would consider different different statements.

24
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.970
It will not change your HTML or anything.

25
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.050
It will remain the same.

26
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.460
Then with the Oracle database, I'm setting this all the connections and everything.

27
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.870
Then create statements.

28
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.310
I'm getting the statements.

29
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.330
So for the viewing, the data from the event database, I'm going to use statements select start from

30
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.490
event, which is basically event details.

31
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.040
So after that event details, it will.

32
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.450
Jake.

33
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.570
Every event details your event details, it's printing.

34
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.800
So I'm going to show in the tabular form.

35
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.270
So using the CSS, I need to improve this.

36
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.010
Also, you can improve your CSS things you are.

37
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.480
But for the simplicity, I'm going to use your table simply so these simple table table border with

38
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.590
one with turn everything I'm specifying here so no need to worry about this is one and how I can proceed

39
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.950
with this.

40
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.280
It will take care of all the border things.

41
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.200
Then these are some titles.

42
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.830
Event number.

43
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.000
Event name.

44
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.650
Even name then coordinator.

45
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.020
Coordinator, contact.

46
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.360
And I removed this part also because.

47
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.940
It will take more space coordinator contact fees when you do it so you can add more fields like guest

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.670
speaker and everything you can add image part.

49
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.360
Also there you have to upload the image of something.

50
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.900
You can use different parts like that.

51
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.050
You can create some cookies to store passwords and everything data.

52
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.190
So there are more things you can search and put inside this, but I'm doing the basic things inside

53
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.610
this.

54
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.490
So.

55
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.630
As these are done what is while r.p.

56
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.100
So this is executing.

57
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.860
So I want to display each and everything inside this event table or event database.

58
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.840
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a report next as this loop is endless.

59
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.600
This will not end at all.

60
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.870
R.P dot next until we reach the end part.

61
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.770
This is the end of this database.

62
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.630
This is the last line of this database.

63
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.420
It will end the file loop.

64
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.990
So for this, what is going to eat us?

65
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.700
It's going to fetch in them.

66
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.950
What is in here?

67
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.180
Even number.

68
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.130
But how it while showing them all the significance of enemies.

69
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.460
The enum is the similar character name or we can see similar that variable name which I used for the

70
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.500
stored event number inside.

71
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.610
Database.

72
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.720
So always remember these names are very significant.

73
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.380
Always remember what you gave on that school run school command line to create database.

74
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.590
It's very important.

75
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.850
Then I'm going to do this and I'm going to print inside the rows directly and I'm going to insert that

76
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.000
rows, then connection commit.

77
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.740
I'm committing this connection, I'm closing this connection, I'm ending all the tags which I invoked

78
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.840
already with table and everything.

79
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.950
And these are the so this is for the event or view event for admin part similar part I'm going to show

80
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.180
on the participant part.

81
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.420
Also, you can create one another method or you can hide something so you can hide some coordinator

82
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.080
number or anything.

83
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.160
But I want to show everything to the publicly for the participants.

84
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.720
So these are done.

85
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.050
But for the participants, I'm going to show the two things for the participants.

86
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.310
What?

87
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.870
I'm going to show two things.

88
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.680
One is view.

89
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.870
Second is registration for the registration HTML.

90
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.050
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create another one form for which action register.

91
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.160
So register is basically the Java servlet name to register their all things like event number, event

92
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.250
name, card number, expiry date, CVB, etc. etc..

93
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.770
So you can include this also.

94
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.790
Otherwise, you can put the view event as another.

95
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.000
You can create one another servlet to show the event.

96
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.990
In that other part, you can create one event, register button there, and after that clicking it will

97
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.030
proceed for the registration page also.

98
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.480
So I'm creating one simple scenario of the form.

99
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.530
Because I'm using the CSS and everything, it will take time to check everything, every part.

100
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.870
So for this, I'm going to proceed with an event.

101
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.330
Name the event number.

102
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.530
Enter card expiry date CV.

103
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.990
And once this is explained, proceed for the payment gateway.

104
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.250
So I'm dealing with this.

105
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.440
So this is all about how we can create the registration estimate.

106
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.610
So for this purpose we need to create when the registration register.

107
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.170
So it also.

108
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.640
So go to the register that this.

109
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.360
So before that you need to create.

110
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.100
So let's like go to these source packages right click new and servlet.

111
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.370
Again.

112
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.400
I'm not telling you how to click that part.

113
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.890
Also to add it to the web dot XML file.

114
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.940
So go to that register dot java and I already created a report each and every code because it takes

115
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.570
time to run and go through with the code.

116
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.600
But while you are writing in the post time, it will take time.

117
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:52.140
But if you use through this part, this very easy part, I'm telling, so I am fetching from I am going

118
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.740
to HTML form and printing this.

119
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.440
So these are again, I'm going to use Duplass method, but before that you should remember what I'm

120
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.550
going to use here is in view event I'm using do get method.

121
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.130
So why I'm using do get method is.

122
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.920
I'm not.

123
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.520
I'm displaying it publicly.

124
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:22.190
Second thing, I don't want to waste time for off users on this to show that we went is so do we.

125
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.430
The method is very fast.

126
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.560
Then do post.

127
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.720
If I'm using glucose method, I'm not posting anything, I'm just selecting this and I'm displaying.

128
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.450
So do get method for the fetching the request.

129
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.790
It's very efficient so I'm using this.

130
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.650
So inside this registered or java as I told you this is print writer.

131
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:46.230
I am fetching from it HTML form from that card number and everything.

132
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.250
So inside this my sequence is different.

133
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.540
Not No, don't worry about your sequence.

134
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.090
Your form sequence is different and this sequence is different.

135
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.050
Nothing will happen.

136
00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:01.560
So for my purpose for storing inside the database I'm using this sequence was card number.

137
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.280
Then you've indent, then CVB, then cardholder name in name and an event name.

138
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.680
I'm going to store it into the card database.

139
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.810
So, you know, this is the this thing.

140
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.560
Let me go some part of per year.

141
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.450
I am printing that connection with database.

142
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:32.220
So you know how we can connect to this, our database so similarly like that, you can show into the

143
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.130
database or connect to the database.

144
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.790
Then again, I'm printing or inserting this inside the database until the A6 values all the values inside

145
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:42.380
the card.

146
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:50.940
So always remember you have to create that similar rows inside the table of card like this CVV and etc.

147
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.110
connection or commit connection goes through inside the registration.

148
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.470
You always see the CV.

149
00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.960
We should be in the password field like dot dot, dot dotted CV.

150
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.540
Then you can also use that.

151
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.530
If equivalent is not more than three, then there is an error.

152
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:14.310
If card number is not exist or it's valid, you can check or you can check for the expiry date.

153
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.770
For that, you can create such part.

154
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.310
Once it's done, you can go with this payment.

155
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.370
So payment estimate is nothing but showing the information your payment is done or something or proceeding

156
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.980
to the payment gateway, etc., etc. You can do that or proceeding or printing some.

157
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.840
Our transaction is page or transaction.

158
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.790
See anything you can do.

159
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.880
So this is all our register page.

160
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.800
So as I told you, you need to create a one payment.

161
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.390
So payment is like, not.

162
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:48.980
It's very simple.

163
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.470
I will print this.

164
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.360
Will come to payment portal.

165
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.120
You can use similar things you can use like.

166
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.610
Swimming beach, etc. are things you can add.

167
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.720
Payment is done.

168
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.060
Go to back page.

169
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.210
Anything you can print here.

170
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.650
I'm printing just this.

171
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:14.410
Once it is done you need you have created everything so inside this transaction details.

172
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:20.410
So as I told you this is all about the this part of the for the participants.

173
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:28.750
But you can create one another method which your participants should look like, which you inside registered,

174
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.900
which you inside don't register.

175
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.670
You can do that.

176
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.530
Also using the databases.

177
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.480
You can create some foreign keys.

178
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.750
Public key private keys, also not null methods.

179
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.070
Also inside the database.

180
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:44.290
I'm not considering very higher level database here, so I'm proceeding with the simple database here.

181
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:53.530
So for the admin part or admin end, we were left with one another method which is transaction details.

182
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.790
So for the transaction details, what I'm going to show I'm going to show one method here.

183
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.740
We reach transaction history for the estimates.

184
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.460
So in this part, I'm going to create one HTML inside the Java only.

185
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.490
So transaction history will look like this.

186
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:16.390
So it will ask me for everything I get method I'm going to use because I'm just fetching this from the

187
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.140
database.

188
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:23.610
Then I'm going to use similar database select start from transaction details and the event number event

189
00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.060
name the name on that then payment payment date, etc., etc..

190
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.790
I'm going to display here.

191
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.090
So this is all about this.

192
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.910
Now let us see how we can deploy it on the part.

193
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:41.740
But before that, let us see what is the difference between this include and forward method.

194
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.020
So servlet request dispatcher is on different thing.

195
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:53.470
Request is dispatcher provides the interface to the facility to dispatching the request to another resources

196
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.490
like HTML, servlet, JCP, etc..

197
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.810
There are two methods forward which forward the request from the servlet to another.

198
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.260
Sources include contents include the content of the resources.

199
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.000
So how look like like for where the method is.

200
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.550
If request is sent, servlet is done, it should forward to the servlet to other way.

201
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:18.580
If it should show the response response again, another response is generated and is sent to the back

202
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.200
to the browser or user.

203
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.230
I can see inside the include method what is doing request send to the servlet.

204
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:34.330
It includes the solid to and again display to the servlet one only servlet one creates one another response.

205
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.750
We just find that response and is showing to the include method.

206
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:45.040
So it's very simple as you can see inside our query already created with log in so we can use this sorry

207
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.780
username or password is not exist or you can use welcome username anything you can use.

208
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:57.340
So let us see how we can deploy this part over this project on web.

209
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.980
So I'm going to run this first.

210
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.670
So we are using your local server if you want to publish this globally.

211
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.100
There are different things you can use.

212
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.810
You can use web hosting, which provides Java CE panel you can use.

213
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.810
Then Heroku app is also available on web.

214
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.980
We use this PostgreSQL.

215
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:25.420
So inside this you have to create one form or XML, which is properties DOT XML, which is available

216
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.170
on Internet.

217
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.460
And you can see that.

218
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:33.700
But for the purpose, I'm going to use your glossary server only with the local host.

219
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.540
So let us see how we can proceed with our project.

220
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.930
And we are already done with all the things I told you.

221
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:46.870
Inside this project, you can enhance it more with using some different techniques also.

222
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.300
So let us see how we can proceed with this.

223
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.200
So this is our main page, as I told you.

224
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.340
Go to the admin, log in.

225
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.880
I told you.

226
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.750
Then I'm printing this username.

227
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.220
I told you we already move this spot.

228
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.260
So we went details.

229
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.660
Then I told you we went.

230
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.530
So for the this you can do with this coding.

231
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.930
So I will already check this part.

232
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.330
Let us see how we can add another event here.

233
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:19.260
Event number is 2 a.m. printing this event name is virtual effects I printing this anything you can

234
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.540
name coordinate the name I'm printing this as a.

235
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.470
This only coordinator number.

236
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.760
You can print anything.

237
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.140
No need to worry about that.

238
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.810
For registration and printing.

239
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.780
250.

240
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.900
Europe is like this when you have event.

241
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:41.750
G.

242
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.630
You can print anything or.

243
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.710
In law.

244
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.170
Anything you can read?

245
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.280
I'm just giving the example.

246
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.080
I'm printing like 20th July 2021.

247
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.370
I'm.

248
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.580
I'm printing here.

249
00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.140
Or you can use 2020.

250
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.890
You're your choice.

251
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:01.690
I'm printing.

252
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.780
I'm submitting.

253
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.310
So now you can see is added.

254
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.430
So let us see how our argument is added here.

255
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.420
So go to the View event link.

256
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.730
As you can see, our view and this is added to this part event details.

257
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:24.830
So let us see how we can proceed with our participant page also participant of events page.

258
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:30.380
Once you participant log in, we already have seen we can create sign up page go to the login page then

259
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.690
go to the this 101.

260
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.870
I already created the user then submit.

261
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.390
Now we can see our view events.

262
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.850
So these are two events we already have seen.

263
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.610
So let us see how we can register for the event.

264
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.620
So enter the event name.

265
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.770
I'm printing this virtual effects event number two.

266
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.300
Then enter card number.

267
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.020
I'm printing anything.

268
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.260
987641.

269
00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.590
Or when I am printing expiry date is zero nine.

270
00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:08.970
2020 CVB You can print anything your CV cardholder names and printing.

271
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.730
John's closest to payment.

272
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:18.080
So the is you can proceed it to the payment portal or anything you can do.

273
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.880
I'm just printing premium payment is done.

274
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.980
Go to backspace.

275
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.210
So this is creating a simple thing.

276
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:29.360
You can proceed with some like I'm going to approach it with PayPal only so you can further move to

277
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.410
the PayPal page or some third party payment portals also.

278
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.560
So this is all about this.

279
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.590
So let us see how we can see in the admin part this transaction history.

280
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.380
So go to admin login again.

281
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.290
I'm printing.

282
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.170
I'm going with username here.

283
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.040
Submit.

284
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.900
Transaction details.

285
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.730
So I want to view transaction details.

286
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.950
So as you can see, even number is to even name is this, name is this and payment.

287
00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.140
So for this done this is done.

288
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:04.600
So you can create a one filter option here to filter that event names according to the payment date.

289
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:11.740
Also you can do so, etc., etc. You can do these things or you can add some payment date here.

290
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.980
So this is all about how we can proceed with our project.

291
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.020
So we are done with our project now.

292
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.540
You can move it further.

293
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.420
Some advanced things inside this.

294
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:31.380
So our event registration portal is done for the admin part and participant part is all.

295
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.100
Thank for this, so thank you for attending this.

296
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.990
And we already done all the parts here.

297
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.130
Thank you.
