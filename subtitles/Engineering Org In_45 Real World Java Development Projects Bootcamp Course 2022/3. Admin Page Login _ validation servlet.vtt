WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:10.540
So we already have seen how we created or set up our Java servlet for this project and we know the basics

2
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.300
of Java solid how we are going to use this.

3
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.160
So first we created an index or HTML.

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.180
As I told you for for the previous things.

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.300
And I added some cases file also your.

6
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.110
Known for admin login or administrative login.

7
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.520
I created one page.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.170
Basically I told you in that video, I'm going to create that page.

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.700
So I created a login page for our admin login.

10
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.790
In further, we are going to see how we can create participant login page or signup page also.

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.690
So in this this page, I'm going to create a login email.

12
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.030
So now we can create entertainment pages in webpages, web page, contents, all the web related or

13
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.250
frontend related part.

14
00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.490
So just to go there in that left part, right click on web page new and you can create HTML pages from

15
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.790
here.

16
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.770
So I created I already created this due to time constraint.

17
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.200
I will tell you how I'm going to create this, created this.

18
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.280
So this is admin log in page.

19
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.520
As you all know, you can remove this part.

20
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.310
This is by default, but I'm going to remove this part also.

21
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.900
So this is HTML.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.650
This is head part of our project and everything.

23
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.670
And for this I'm going to put admin log in, page everything and I'm adding the CSS.

24
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.080
So main thing in this is the form basically in what we are going to see is the form.

25
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.670
Basically we are typing username and password in the form in the HTML.

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.890
So this is how we can create form form in this post, we are going to post that form.

27
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.390
So here is the action action roles that what is action is going to do is validate ID.

28
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.930
So what is the validity?

29
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.020
The validity is the name which I am going to create one Java servlet four validate that part.

30
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.240
So this name is very important.

31
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.200
So for the validation of admin, I'm going to give its name, form, name as or action as validate id

32
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.270
then this is username.

33
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.070
I'm going to put user's username.

34
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.920
No need to put this username then this so placeholder.

35
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.800
It should be username.

36
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.750
Like you can see the user name placeholder but name again the name.

37
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.340
And this action is very important.

38
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.370
Give the meaningful name for this this parameter.

39
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.590
So this parameter name is a username.

40
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.460
So it is like that, it's validation name.

41
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.940
Or we can say how we can recognize that's part username, part or text by this name a username.

42
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.310
Similarly for the password, this password a password and each type is password.

43
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.580
So we can see that dot dot part in HTML part also.

44
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.320
And that's it about all things.

45
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.220
So I'm just created center and for centralize everything and put it in the single code.

46
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.010
So this is all about our creating a login.

47
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.750
I will reformat this just to ensure this is looking good.

48
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.820
So always remember the name for that parameter should be very significant.

49
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.660
And this action due meaningful names for these things don't give some random names or something like

50
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.930
A, B or C, give the meaningful names.

51
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.440
So as you can see, our partisan, we can say log in, but how we can validate that part.

52
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.460
So I'm considering admin have some or we can give the admins username and password by default.

53
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.890
You need to put in the database and everything.

54
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.670
So for that I'm going to create a Java servlet or we can say Java program so we can create Java program.

55
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.480
All Java programs should inside in source packages folder.

56
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.840
So just right click on source packages below the web packages.

57
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.200
As Web pages, you can see source packages right click new and you can see third option is Java servlet,

58
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.130
click on that.

59
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.610
So when this is done, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this part because the name and

60
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.340
application lowercase is very important.

61
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.120
Validate it.

62
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.450
I'm just copying this and I'm going to create a new servlet here.

63
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.490
So this is so we don't need to specify a package or anything because this is very simple project.

64
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.180
If you want to enhance it more, you can create some inside that source package.

65
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.690
You can create some default packages or some packages.

66
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.280
Also click next here.

67
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.880
These are very important add information to deployment descriptor, which is basically web dot, XML

68
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.590
deployment descriptor.

69
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.400
So to mark this, this is very important and click finish.

70
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.290
Once it is done, it will create some default template in that default packages validity.

71
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.400
As you can see, you can delete this part, comment part then this is this.

72
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.400
Also you can delete it also.

73
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.990
There is there are some default things mentioned here.

74
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.370
So you can delete this also and you can delete this track each and everything.

75
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.790
So this is done now.

76
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.480
So you can see this is validated, bipartisan, and these all things are accepted.

77
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.990
To minimize this, you can just start to not mention this part.

78
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.270
And then again, this is also you can done with Java servlet.

79
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.980
Java servlet, which is basically Java.

80
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.960
I'm inputting dot star.

81
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.930
Who and this is also Ugandan with HTTP servlet.

82
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.370
So what you can do put start here so you can remove this part.

83
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.210
So again.

84
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.240
So I'm going to minimize this on things, important things.

85
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.360
So now you can see we are done with this part, but.

86
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.940
What is there is nothing inside this.

87
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.670
So we are going to write logic here.

88
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.840
So.

89
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.270
Let us write one logic or we can say logical thing here.

90
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.060
So let me just like this.

91
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.600
And.

92
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.470
I think something is missing.

93
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.860
Okay.

94
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.800
You're.

95
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.670
What happened?

96
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.920
And.

97
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.410
Okay.

98
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.910
Okay, okay.

99
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.930
No need.

100
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.310
You can delete this part.

101
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.440
Also, I'm going to delete this part also because it is we are going to create our own method here.

102
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.200
And we have some.

103
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.280
Usually turtles on display.

104
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.540
So that's it.

105
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.160
We already created this part.

106
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.800
So let us begin with how we can create it.

107
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.980
So always remember this public void or we can say servlet class validity should extend HTTP servlet.

108
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.100
It is by default class inside Java.

109
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.610
After that you can create your own method so you can create private or public method.

110
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.480
I'm going to create public method or you can create protected also.

111
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.210
So if you want, you can create private or public.

112
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.520
I'm going to create public method your public.

113
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.950
Void.

114
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.820
Then do post what is due.

115
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.230
Plus, does it fetch the data from that HTML page and it will post something?

116
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:51.060
So domains for fetching data and posting means some printing some things.

117
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.800
So http servlet.

118
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.720
It is basically class.

119
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.620
Nothing more servlet.

120
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.700
Now, this is very important request.

121
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:01.960
For this request.

122
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.310
I want request.

123
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.510
So what is doing that for the request purpose?

124
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.300
It is creating some request.

125
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.940
Similarly for HTTP response.

126
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.820
HTP.

127
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.600
So let.

128
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.340
This.

129
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:19.990
Bonds.

130
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.480
What it will create.

131
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.410
It will ask for response so you can change your variables.

132
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:33.770
According to that, I'm putting response and request here only for this purpose and what it does.

133
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.870
It's to some exceptions.

134
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.620
What is the basic?

135
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.920
Basically exceptions throws exception.

136
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.890
Are you exception?

137
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.990
So let exception.

138
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.050
So instead of using, always try catch.

139
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.320
I'm going to use this.

140
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.850
So.

141
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.910
It is showing me the error.

142
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.380
Basically.

143
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.100
What is that?

144
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:10.660
Okay.

145
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.080
Okay.

146
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.350
It is asking me to create a class and everything.

147
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.980
So no need?

148
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.190
No.

149
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.810
I created one plus.

150
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.150
No need to mention this.

151
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.020
In fact, you can delete this part.

152
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.280
After that, I will tell you how we can invoke this.

153
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.030
Okay.

154
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.540
It will take time to reload everything.

155
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.520
So as you can see, we are now done with this part.

156
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.210
HDB solid and it's loaded.

157
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.510
Now I exception with solid exception.

158
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.980
Or remember you have to put always that close and everything here.

159
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.510
Otherwise it will not work.

160
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.840
So now let's build the logic.

161
00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.870
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create some print statement.

162
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.430
So it is basically I0 part of all Java.

163
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.480
I'll print.

164
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.020
Right.

165
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.660
Screenwriter.

166
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:13.920
I would.

167
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.020
Is equal to.

168
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.090
What I'm going to create.

169
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.030
I'm going to ask for response.

170
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.700
Response Dot get writer.

171
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.060
So.

172
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.110
It will create some print writer segments.

173
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:41.260
So what it will do in the statement, it will response and put that part in in the further but main

174
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.420
usage of this is very important.

175
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.350
Always remember.

176
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.530
Out means printing that statement.

177
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:53.530
So it is very important to mention what is meant by out here you can out is just a variable name but

178
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.960
you should use print writer for the response.

179
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.820
You cannot use anything here.

180
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:03.700
So I'm going to use string UN to fetch username from that a login method.

181
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:11.670
So what I can do is I'm going to ask for a request request dot get parameter as you know the I mean

182
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.450
I'm needed the parameter method, so I'm going to ask for git parameter.

183
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.550
So this will ask me for the parameter.

184
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.120
But which parameter I want?

185
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.490
I want your username.

186
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.950
So I'm going to copy this in a log.

187
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.210
In a username because I mentioned that the name is this.

188
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.570
So similarly I will put for this.

189
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.170
Which user?

190
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.280
Name.

191
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.210
I like this.

192
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.970
Similarly, I'm going to fetch password.

193
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.240
But for that I'm not going to write again.

194
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.690
This I'm going to just put p w here.

195
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.480
E w.

196
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.440
And I am going to change the name also.

197
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.380
Just you can copy paste this from here.

198
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.030
No need to check and type it again.

199
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.080
Just copy this.

200
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.830
And based.

201
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.430
And I'm going to mention this as.

202
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.420
Which.

203
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.150
Password.

204
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.780
So it will fetch from that.

205
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.830
So let us see.

206
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.440
I'm what I'm going to do.

207
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.050
I'm going to mention the set of some username and password.

208
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.790
So for this case, I'm going to consider only for 8 minutes.

209
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.930
So no.

210
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.990
So now we are done with this part.

211
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.080
So I created a set, a1011024.

212
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.780
You want you to use three you for like you are seeing this.

213
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.900
So these are the for admin with username and password.

214
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.370
So what is logic, basically?

215
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.940
I told you I can use this, P.W..

216
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.380
So what I'm going to create.

217
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.300
I'm going to create a false ladder here.

218
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.370
Let us see how we can create.

219
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.890
I will put here is.

220
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:50.940
LS.

221
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.690
I did check.

222
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.720
Entries.

223
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.380
20 entries.

224
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.030
So let us see how we can create effects.

225
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.150
So if I'm going to use this p.w.

226
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:13.380
Dot you know, there is one java method called you can directly use equals as if you know you can directly

227
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.010
use there equal if p.w equals to p one.

228
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.520
Okay.

229
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.080
And then.

230
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.810
BW Or sorry.

231
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.650
UN That's for the user name.

232
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.320
UN Dot equals.

233
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.040
You can see this is coming, you one.

234
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.980
What is going to do is.

235
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.740
It is going to create a request.

236
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.390
DISPATCHER So what is the request?

237
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.120
DISPATCHER It will dispatch that request.

238
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.850
What I can say for that response, it is dispersing, dispatching the request.

239
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.140
This dispatcher.

240
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.140
This is just by default method.

241
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.700
It is my username or I can say for variable.

242
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.530
Request Dot.

243
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.320
The dispatcher.

244
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:11.780
I'm going to copy this, but I'm not going to print this again because this picture there is going to

245
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:17.980
dispatch, I need to mention next page as this is called, our password and usernames are correct.

246
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.650
It should follow it to the next page as best practice.

247
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:27.560
So I'm going to give the name as admin for the next, which is HTML.

248
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.570
So it will respond to that also.

249
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:38.710
So okay before that request dispatcher I forgot requests.

250
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.550
Dot get.

251
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:48.670
I of want to get right with this picture we are creating this but where it should be getting so it is

252
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.200
get that request venture.

253
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.930
So there is one important statement here.

254
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.350
This is not what I can say.

255
00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.790
Dispatching it is just creating that it should go there.

256
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.550
So using if I created for p to you do same admin even html.

257
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:11.350
I'm going to forward this similarly for this p w all things I created.

258
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.950
If the credentials are incorrect, we are going to stay on this page.

259
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:22.360
So output println I'm going to mention here is the beautiful thing in the java servlet you can use HTML

260
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.020
symbols here.

261
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.040
Center H1 one.

262
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.270
I'm going to print this.

263
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:29.740
Please enter valid and valid username and password for.

264
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.790
Edwin.

265
00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.380
So I'm going to print this on each HTML page.

266
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.500
So it is not going to print on our command line or something.

267
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.910
It is going to print on HTML.

268
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.370
So it should be in some HTML syntax here.

269
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.900
So I put this.

270
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.540
Now I'm going to request this.

271
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:53.320
But what is going this is going to forward but it should stay on the same page for the staying on same

272
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:53.650
page.

273
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.890
I'm going to include I'm going to use include.

274
00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.110
So this is all about we done.

275
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:08.030
But remember, we are going to use your this sentence but how the Java program will understood that

276
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:17.120
this is the what I am telling is something text or something is HTML for that purpose I'm going to set

277
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.800
the content for this.

278
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:26.540
So the content setting is very simple response dot set content.

279
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.970
Content type or capital type.

280
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.880
Remember, these are the some default methods inside Java.

281
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.940
You can put this text.

282
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.340
Slash estimate, it can be text or email.

283
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.040
So wait a minute.

284
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.920
Something is wrong or.

285
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:50.530
Okay.

286
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:50.820
Okay.

287
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.270
We are done with this.

288
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.830
Now we are done with this.

289
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.670
So we are done with this now.

290
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.420
Over now.

291
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.650
I will deploy this and I will tell you how it's going to work.

292
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:10.550
So as you know, for deployment, as I told you, this is created, but this is our index page.

293
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.030
So let's go to the admin log in page.

294
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.020
As you can see, we created already the admin login.

295
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.710
You can change the format and everything here.

296
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.580
So I'm going to put the username.

297
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:25.560
So I'm going to put username a1014 the 101.

298
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.790
We know the password.

299
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.230
One, two, three, four.

300
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.270
As you can see, 404 is not fun because we haven't created further.

301
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.920
That part is HTML.

302
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.560
Later on we are going to create that part, everything.

303
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.380
But before that, what I can do, I can put some different password to three four for you.

304
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.520
I'm going to print so you can see.

305
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.320
Please enter valid username and password for admin.

306
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.590
As you can see, our password is different.

307
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.640
Similarly, I am putting a108.

308
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.720
That is not to mention that admin is not mentioned.

309
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.980
I am going to put some random thing here again.

310
00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.530
So it is going to validate everything and it's asking please enter a valid username and password for

311
00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.730
a username for admin.

312
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.980
So this is how we are going to validate admin page for the participant.

313
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.540
Log in what we are going to create.

314
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:19.660
We are asking to participants or your guest to first sign up our page so that.
