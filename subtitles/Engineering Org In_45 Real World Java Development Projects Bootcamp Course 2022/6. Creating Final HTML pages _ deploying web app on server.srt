1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,430
So we already created everything here.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,550
So let me explain what I created in the next part.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:18,960
So I added some form here in this which HTML pages, so much HTML pages as you can see, which is quantity

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,630
and everything.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,740
Add book, then add librarian form.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,650
Also I created with mobile number and everything.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
Is nothing admin for that.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,090
Esteem and purpose and everything I created.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,270
So this is all about how we already created this.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,680
So let me explain.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,300
What I'm going to do is I'm going to just showing you the deployment in this part.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,310
But let me explain what is admin carousels and everything is done.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,500
So this is log in admin form.

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,120
Which is basically.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,340
So let's then librarian.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,550
Librarian log in I'm creating so.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,210
You can say the servlet if you want to.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,830
Do you have to mention this again then this is all email address and password method.

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,910
I'm going to do it.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,260
So this is basically navigation admin HTML page, then navigation home page, then return the book form

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,480
to form and return book everything.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,120
So you have to check each and every part here.

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,550
Otherwise you will get sometimes error here or log in and everything part.

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,050
Also let me close this page and I will explain this.

25
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,760
So library method is nothing, but I'm going to add some librarian methods here.

26
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,320
Hope you already created everything inside this and inside the DB.

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,420
You mention everything here.

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,960
So let me do one thing is here is I'm going to mention.

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,230
User.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,600
It makes them mention the password.

31
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,500
And it is.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,210
There's a password and everything here.

33
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,230
So.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,240
Look, I don't want to deploy it again because I will deploy it.

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,330
So this is done inside.

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:06,840
We.

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,320
Let me explain.

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,310
What is this doing?

39
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,450
So this is DB part, which is connection of skill.

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,600
Always remember you have to mention G.P.S. drivers also.

41
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:16,930
Yeah.

42
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,190
So this ad book part here, I'm going to add the book part.

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,960
And once this is done, book is saved.

44
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,830
So in the librarian side, we can say this for the librarian part only.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,590
Then after this add book form, why I'm creating ADD book form.

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,120
It is just a basic part.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,540
I written in HTML with Java to put the request dispatcher and add book form and everything here.

48
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,000
So there's nothing but just printing the statements html codes here.

49
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,520
Then add librarian.

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,880
This part is also very important here.

51
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,860
So it's adding the librarian inside this.

52
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:06,050
And this very simple thing I'm adding here with some HTML pages or then this is ad librarian form,

53
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:12,710
as I told you before that you have to check each and everything here like written Google Dot HTML contents,

54
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,250
written book.

55
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,830
But you need to mention where is the written book?

56
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,570
So let's again then you have to mention fully specified name.

57
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,820
Then you have to check this also.

58
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,040
And everything.

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,010
So for me is again so late.

60
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,960
So we have to mention this.

61
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,390
This is again so late.

62
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,520
So you have to mention this then also.

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,810
So let's mention the fully specified names.

64
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,860
Otherwise it will give the internal errors again and again.

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,030
So I already created this part.

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,030
But remember, you have to read this.

67
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,980
Let us check navigation homepage.

68
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,260
Also, don't double click that part, otherwise it will start the running part.

69
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,930
So now we are done with this part, some HTML part also.

70
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,900
Then the navigation admin page.

71
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,640
I already mentioned everything here.

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,650
Then in admin, log in or library and log in part.

73
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,780
I also mentioned the solid part here.

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,870
Then this is no longer just for adults.

75
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,620
That's.

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,200
I mean if you one I also mentioned so let's again here.

77
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,800
Then index.html need admin log in form and book.

78
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,720
Also I need to mention so let's dot because it's really important here.

79
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,940
Librarian also.

80
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,830
So let's not.

81
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,900
So.

82
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,880
And and everything.

83
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,130
Okay, now we are done with everything.

84
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:54,220
Always give the fully specified name and this is the admin login form or librarian form as I told you

85
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,210
inside the java.

86
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,420
Then let me close some things because we already created this part.

87
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,520
This.

88
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,180
This is done, basically.

89
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,340
Let us go to delete book.

90
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,410
I created one delete book thing also your then delete librarian method.

91
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,350
Also I created because we need to mention this part again delete library which is basically deleting

92
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,290
the librarian edit librarian basically editing that librarian part and all the things I have done.

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,550
Issue book is very important.

94
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,010
I create an new book form and issue book method also here for the form, methods and everything.

95
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,290
Let us clean and build this first.

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,260
So you can directly use these methods or you can create your own methods also here with different names.

97
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,610
So if your window is not showing output, as I told you, go to windows.

98
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,350
And that output here.

99
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,740
And hope you can see here.

100
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,810
Now my build is successful.

101
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,490
Let me run this in glass.

102
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,230
We server.

103
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,640
So it will take time to run on the glass.

104
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,260
Free server will be successful.

105
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,990
So let me open chrome first.

106
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,820
My thing is going to that only.

107
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,410
Oh, then.

108
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,200
I will add that.

109
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,120
Part.

110
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,460
We'll begin to see this this meeting.

111
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:30,030
And let me go through the admin as I know this is admin one, two, three, logging.

112
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,060
I'm going to add library.

113
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,760
And basically, as I mentioned, it's John.

114
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,570
John.

115
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,180
And the university when possibly.

116
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,250
One, two, three.

117
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,200
Mobile number I mentioned 2989024450.

118
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:59,970
LeBron added successful if I click view LeBron is not showing anything wrote this so we created everything

119
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,760
here as a library and then everything.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,590
So this is all about how we can create our methods and everything.

121
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,120
Hope you understand this.

122
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:17,910
Always remember you have to specify some default names and everything here and don't need to mention

123
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,830
each and every time your everything.

124
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,980
Inside law library in the.

125
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,810
Also you can see some methods already created like save and everything.

126
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,170
So always give some meaningful names to these things.

127
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,380
And I already created this part again.

128
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,200
Why it is showing me sometimes error.

129
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:44,130
Because if you see my library method there are four files name ID also.

130
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,760
So let me add one more thing.

131
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:57,660
You can say ID and I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to mention that ID is always some default thing

132
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,380
you can say.

133
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,290
So ID is equal to one.

134
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm mentioning ID is always one.

135
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,510
And because I haven't mentioned that part.

136
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,150
Host inside this I'd.

137
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:16,810
Boy.

138
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,420
So let us put this.

139
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,850
Let me make a question mark here.

140
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,130
Okay.

141
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,570
So because there are five fields inside this one, two, three, four, five.

142
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,530
And in the Liberian method, also one, two, three, four, five fields there.

143
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,650
So sometimes it gives the error.

144
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,910
To me, this is second, this is third.

145
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,570
This is for time.

146
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,670
This is fifth.

147
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,370
Then what is the first part is.

148
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,070
He is not sit.

149
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,440
String.

150
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,250
One form of it is basically it.

151
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:11,110
So you can put this also or you can check your methods also like I'm using gate name, get your name

152
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,360
on things now so you can use this also or otherwise you can mention directly like.

153
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
One year.

154
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,360
You can redeploy these things.

155
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,520
And again, you can check.

156
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:33,930
So always remember, you have to keep that part specific.

157
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,310
Like if you created two or more things inside this part.

158
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,210
Always you have to mention.

159
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,530
Those similar things.

160
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,400
You have to create some similar things also.

161
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,920
John Deere at University.

162
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,990
JB One, two, three.

163
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,710
And J.

164
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,600
One, two, three.

165
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,550
Mobile number is 9890.

166
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,450
Online.

167
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,080
Submit.

168
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,170
Now you can see why these things are adding because I haven't mentioned the idea.

169
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,550
So you can create, edit and everything, but I don't want to change this IED.

170
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,300
I'm mentioning that when you can create a loop and you can do everything.

171
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,780
So I know this is my email now for the librarian purpose.

172
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,290
If I go to this and I put this part.

173
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,990
And give one, two, three and log in.

174
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,130
Now you can see I'm going to the login page and you can put your everything.

175
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,390
This is all part.

176
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,910
If I go to the ad book, I can add the book.

177
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,080
If I click the view book, I can click the View book.

178
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,930
Let me add, one book is called Number is one name is.

179
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,960
Wings.

180
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,440
It is a big.

181
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,790
Publisher is quality.

182
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,660
I'm mentioning anything or don't check that.

183
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,750
And remember quality and quantity I'm mentioning too.

184
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
So book books are successful.

185
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,420
You can sell this book and it should issue book.

186
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,480
If I created book, call number is one student ID is mentioning SX 101 student name is.

187
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,030
James.

188
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,630
Student Mobile number 90234501.

189
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,170
That's it.

190
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,340
You should book book you should successfully.

191
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,060
You should book.

192
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,850
You can see this is issue.

193
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,810
If you want to return, the call number is one s number is 101 written book.

194
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:48,870
So sometimes it gives the error because it's 101 is not inside this because you can see as 101 is this

195
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,490
and you have to return that book.

196
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,610
All of this.

197
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:00,260
So this is all about you can create e-library methods and this is all about how you can create each

198
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,030
and every part.

199
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,340
If I create log in, you can see username and password is.

200
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,200
Not correct.

201
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:15,350
If I go to the home and if I put this, you can see this is very informal part and you can create item

202
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,800
in form.

203
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,950
And each and every method is also I will mention each and every methods.

204
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:25,760
But you can create such methods and you can create add a librarian part also here as I created your.

205
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,900
If I go to this and I click, you can view this, I can delete this part.

206
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,580
Also, you can see now it's deleted.

207
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,950
Then now I'm going to this logout.

208
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,480
You can do that part also.

209
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,150
So this is all about how you can create the login method.

210
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:46,930
Always remember use some specific names as I made some mistake while giving the ID so you can do that

211
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,830
part also.

212
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,300
And what you can do.

213
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,010
You can create one loop here and you can do ID default.

214
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,530
Like I just want to use that loop again and again using for loop you can put after one, you can put

215
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,980
the two second, third, fourth like that you can create.

216
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,740
So these are about how we can create a library method.

217
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,530
So we created all the servlet part and everything.

218
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:15,610
Now we are, we did everything, then we created HTML, we created servlet and we deployed on the class

219
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,180
server.

220
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,490
So this is all about our project.

221
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,560
Thank you.

222
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,040
Hope you understand this project.

223
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,260
You can build your own or things like E library in-hospital methods also.

224
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,860
So this is all about and this is very simple project, I told you.

225
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,120
You can furthermore extend to some card methods.

226
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,260
Also here you can create QR codes.

227
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,500
Also here using some HTML parts.

228
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,910
You can change the UI.

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,080
All this also.
