1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,670
So our project is basically we are going to create a chat application.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:14,380
So we already created three classes server client chat message server for the server establishment client

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,390
is for the user side and chat messages for the handling the all the chat messages.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,260
So I created three classes so we can see three Java files here.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,920
So for first, I'm creating this

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,960
which is basically server file.

7
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:41,020
So as I told you in previous sessions, I did this and I created a constructor I am creating or start

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,430
each and everything.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,100
Always remember the start and some run are both are related to the.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,670
Basically related to the what we can say trading concepts.

11
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,190
So after this, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a function to stop a server.

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,460
So I'm going to create a function to stop server.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,350
Again, it's protected.

14
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,850
Protected.

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,570
Stop.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,260
Then you know, there is one function keep going is equal to also, I'm telling you.

17
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:33,860
Including because all segments should be and then new socket.

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,690
So this I'm going to mention local host.

19
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,150
Which all.

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,780
And.

21
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,680
What I'm going to do is.

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,680
Etch.

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,420
Exception.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,960
E.

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,410
System.

26
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,370
Dot dot intel n e.

27
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,800
So we handled this exception and I created to stop this.

28
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,620
Then I need to create.

29
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,710
So remember why I created the projector?

30
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,720
Because I'm going to use inside this.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,520
Only I'm not invoking inside the client, but so I can use this edge protected also.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,070
So.

33
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,510
The specified is protected.

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,290
This lay.

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,790
Even console.

36
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,270
I can say or we can say message console private.

37
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,060
Or.

38
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,920
Display.

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,170
Do.

40
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,430
I'm bringing message here.

41
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,080
But I need time.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,830
So basically string time is equal to def dot format.

43
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,400
And so this what I'm going to do is I'm going to specify this new.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,500
Date.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,980
As it is.

46
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,240
Let's.

47
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,570
This list.

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,470
Even, you know, this space also.

49
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,650
What is?

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,640
So we have created this zone.

51
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,350
And what I'm going to do is nothing but system dot.

52
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,360
Not telling.

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,920
Fine.

54
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,090
What I'm going to do.

55
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,820
I'm going to bring.

56
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,600
So now I am going to create a synchronized thing.

57
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,700
Are you going to say?

58
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,310
Who brought up cost.

59
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,280
Message.

60
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,900
To all.

61
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,910
Our clients are basically private synchronized.

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,370
What?

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:13,960
Why?

64
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,770
It should be synchronized, I will tell you.

65
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,420
Bullion.

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,240
Broadcast.

67
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,950
Because I'm going to handle it in a thread so it should be synchronized always.

68
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,710
So I created synchronized string.

69
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,650
Really created images.

70
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,220
So I'm creating your message.

71
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,610
Now timestamp is very important at Timestamp.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,710
String.

73
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,280
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this because I'm going to use this again.

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,010
Sort of broadcasting the message.

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
That's it.

76
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,870
And.

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
What I'm going to do is.

78
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:16,410
I'm going to check messages, private or not to check, because I'm going to create a constraint which

79
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,610
can be like you can send message private.

80
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:29,150
That is see to see c klein to Klein, basically.

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,590
So what I'm going to do is for such purpose.

82
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,300
I'm going to split the message.

83
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,420
I will tell you what is the significance of this and I will split this message as this.

84
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,260
Now, what I'm going to do is.

85
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:56,010
If character is this what is the basic thing is basically is it if you put something name like.

86
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,090
And John.

87
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,910
Or you can say at their expense, John.

88
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,420
But added John, then space message.

89
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,170
Private message.

90
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,500
So I'm going to do this so it will help me.

91
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,950
Like that and limit is three while I'm reaching the limit is threes, as you can see.

92
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,040
One, two, three, four.

93
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,640
So like was that it should not be exceed.

94
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,970
So I'm using this and.

95
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,050
Now let me use some.

96
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,010
Okay.

97
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,310
So I will use your.

98
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,930
I will tell you.

99
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,500
What is this?

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,310
All things.

101
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:50,270
So if private mention st mention username only using this so it will go to that particular part and

102
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,060
we loop in in order to find the mentioned name.

103
00:06:53,510 --> 00:07:00,770
Basically, I'm checking in the reverse loop to check the username throughout the client head and I

104
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,880
will tell you what is the gate username and each and everything here because I haven't created any client

105
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,450
yet.

106
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,980
So I will create that and I will tell you what is this basically.

107
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,680
So this is all about this.

108
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,410
But what if a message is not found?

109
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:15,800
Is.

110
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,600
Let me do one thing here.

111
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,960
If the message is not phoned, what I'm going to do is I'm going to display something.

112
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,940
I already created this part, I will tell you.

113
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,690
So.

114
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,360
Okay.

115
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,760
Wait a minute.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,430
So this is all about how we can do this.

117
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,770
Wait a minute.

118
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,420
So if this is true, I'm going to mention this.

119
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,370
What if.

120
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,450
If I'm printing else something else, basically.

121
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,360
It should be given some.

122
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:28,120
KING So what I'm going to do is if message is broadcast message, it should be printing something now.

123
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,050
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this part.

124
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,650
This is basically part if if message is not private, it should be broadcast.

125
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,410
So it will be directly put out to the client and it will go to the right.

126
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,920
And I will tell you what is inside the client read only.

127
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,380
So I will tell you what is the significance of this.

128
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,800
So this is all about how we can create this.

129
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,400
Now I'm going to create one log out method also here.

130
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,770
To create one log out thing.

131
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,070
So let me go with the log out also.

132
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,700
Well, this is the end of private and everything.

133
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,060
Okay.

134
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,600
Now.

135
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,830
Okay.

136
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,010
So let me explain all these things.

137
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,900
So we already created this method.

138
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,800
If you know that's what is starting.

139
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,640
This is what the starting of the server.

140
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,030
So we're starting.

141
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,330
Then this is the constructor, basically, as I told you.

142
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Then these are all about of starting.

143
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,020
Why?

144
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,540
It's because I'm using some default libraries here and while keep going now I'm doing this and printing

145
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,540
stops and each and everything.

146
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,120
And then I created a protected void to stop the server.

147
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,430
Because while I'm doing this, keep going is false.

148
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,570
It will stop the server.

149
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,010
Now this is display console message and to broadcast message.

150
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,150
All I'm going with this is the format and F and everything.

151
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,760
If the message is private, I'm splitting this.

152
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,660
What it will do.

153
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,150
It will check something and each and every year first.

154
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,190
Then what it will do is it should be zero plus.

155
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,820
Two means basically that length and it will time plus message.

156
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,850
It will print boolean found is equal to false.

157
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:27,370
Because I'm stopping that part and I'm reversing or I can looping the part in a reverse to check that

158
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:34,090
client through the client ID and using it username and I'm sending to that particular username only

159
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,130
found if found.

160
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,180
Deliver the message and basically break the loop.

161
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,110
If found is not equal to to be basically major is not user found.

162
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,430
It should be written false and false is basically nothing.

163
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:59,930
But if message is a broadcast message, not with any edit or any symbol, it is going to print this.

164
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,530
And what it will do.

165
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,380
We will look in a reverse order to remove the client also because it is disconnected.

166
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,970
If it's disconnected, it should be removed from the client thread.

167
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,670
So I'm removing to the client and client thread is nothing but ArrayList, which is handled through

168
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,880
the throughout the client threads on each and everything.

169
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,990
Then I created one logout method.

170
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,680
Your string disconnected and each and everything.

171
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,710
And similarly I can use this remove part.

172
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,390
As you can see this remove.

173
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,870
It is basically system default thing here and we can save our which is basically ArrayList.

174
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,820
We can put remove here and has broadcast the message.

175
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,350
This notify is equal to that is basically disconnect this.

176
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,020
Room or we can sit chat room.

177
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,960
This is all about how we can do this.

178
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,520
After this.

179
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,470
What is remaining thing is.

180
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:07,210
Or I need to create a server and to run a chat application for the server side.

181
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,880
I need to mention some things.

182
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,240
So what I'm going to do is I'm creating your PCM, basically public static void main.

183
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,460
Then what I'm going to do is here.

184
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
I need to mention some.

185
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,920
Things.

186
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,160
What the things I'm going to mention is what number?

187
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,780
Then switch gears for argument length and each and everything.

188
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,870
So I will mention here or number.

189
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,620
Is equal to 5000.

190
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,190
I'm mentioning 5000.

191
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:49,660
You can check your boat number, then switch case and each and every thing I'm going to mention.

192
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,040
Your.

193
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,840
So let me use this first.

194
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,050
So what is doing this?

195
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,900
It is going to pass that inside this if exception found invalid number java server port number is not

196
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,390
found here.

197
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,940
Basically it will print.

198
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,630
This zero.

199
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,710
It's basically since you said java server because it is not using and server object to start the server,

200
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,910
it will start that object easily.

201
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,140
Server is basically this.

202
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:28,360
So we have we are done with this part, but we are remaining something here which is basically.

203
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, let me check which is this part again.

204
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,000
Somebody said, it's over.

205
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,750
And this is part this part is not it at all.

206
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,860
And this is inside.

207
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,400
And it should be in privacy.

208
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,700
So we created this part.

209
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:53,080
And now what is remaining things we need to create one client right then, which is basically we need

210
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,090
to create a one class for that purpose.

211
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,160
And we already did this.

212
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,440
But now the client trade and all the things are remaining here, which is basically very important and

213
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,380
we are going to create this and now we can stop this basically, which is basically public class and

214
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,210
each and everything.

215
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,230
As you can see, our client is missing.

216
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,140
Now, I'm going to create one client trade also here.

217
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,080
If I'm removing this.

218
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,920
As you can see, nothing is.

219
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,170
Displaying error.

220
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:30,270
So this is all about and we know remaining with some errors, which is basically not declared already.

221
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,310
Now I'm going to declare that part.

222
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,100
So this is how you can delete this part or you can do this part basically.

223
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,200
This is basically server side.

224
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,170
I'm creating one ArrayList int for unique ID date format or number and keep going format.

225
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,710
I'm using your localhost, so no need to mention each and everything.

226
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,420
As you can see, I'm using localhost only.

227
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,270
You can change the port number through this.

228
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,920
So what I did this is I created Zoom to start the server basically because all the things are mentioned

229
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,430
here only.

230
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,170
So once it is started, all things are embedded in this only.

231
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:14,400
So what I'm going to do now is I will do I will create one client class which some methods like get

232
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,880
user name right message, then all the things like stop and each and everything username also I need

233
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,560
to mention.

234
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,490
So I will go with that part.

235
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:31,500
And in the later part I will tell you it's very big code as I as you can see, I already done our own

236
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:39,300
design, but it will help me to run all the processes on the server side and the client program will

237
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,010
be very easy in this part.

238
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,300
So in the next part we are going to see some client things also and chat message things also including

239
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,680
I'm going to create trade also here and before that I will explain the trading part also.
