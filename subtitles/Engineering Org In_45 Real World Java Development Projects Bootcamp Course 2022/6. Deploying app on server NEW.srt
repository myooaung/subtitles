1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:10,580
Previously I told you how we already created and just here Ajax is basically asynchronous java x JavaScript

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,180
XML for you.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,330
And we already done with this part.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,900
So Ajax and everything is mentioned.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,900
Now let me tell you what is the GBC database connection, which is basically Java database connection.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,780
GBK stands for Java database connectivity.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:34,520
It's a Java API to connect the database, execute the query with the database, form the update, execute

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,760
update everything related to the database we can perform in Java.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:46,580
So it is a part of Java is C Java Standard Edition, gdb C API uses gdb C drivers to connect with the

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,270
database.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,530
For different drivers, we are using currently a driver because we are performing Oracle in our database.

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,840
So let us see with this database what we can use.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,710
We can use GBK API to access tabular data stored in the relational database by the help of gdb API.

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,860
We can say delete update fetch data from the database.

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,190
So it's basically API API to connect the GBK driver and create a Java application.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,710
So that's the GBC.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:20,920
Here.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,590
I'm going to show you how we can develop this part.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,880
So after doing that part related to log in, I need to create part four register for that purpose.

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,980
I created here everything related to the register, which is basically quite similar to this with address

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,500
blank and everything I'm going to mention here.

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,600
With the location, everything.

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,500
Unable to connect us over everything I'm going to mention.

24
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,600
So that's it.

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,450
I'm going to provide this, but this is it.

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,410
I am going to create my front end part.

27
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,370
So this is the register.

28
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,730
But this I need to create a register process.

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,950
So for this process, I'm going to create one block and I'm going to specify these names.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,100
Now, I created this database.

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,990
If you want to create tables manually, you have to enter in the skill that commands and create tables

32
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,790
manually.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,010
But I'm providing this only.

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,850
So if you want to create this database, what you are going to do is go to the service file.

35
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,060
Just go to this database.

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,400
Create a new connection and you can check for the Oracle, OCI or Oracle team.

37
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,340
You can choose and you can create new connections if the driver is missing.

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,660
You have to choose that new drivers or latest drivers.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,010
There are different things.

40
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,400
You can add it here, but we are going with Oracle.

41
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,260
My speed is already deployed.

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,290
You can check for that purpose, but Oracle is newly deployed.

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,290
If you want to disconnect, let me delete this part also because there may be some errors.

44
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,250
Also when.

45
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,760
Doing this.

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,000
So let's see it about the services part.

47
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,680
But in the projects only, we need to create a register process to create registration part, then develop

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,630
this on that part and we are going to create one JSP file related to this.

49
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,700
So this is how I'm going to store it using this string user name.

50
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,740
Get parameter to that.

51
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm going to specify this.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,490
Then in this.

53
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,720
This is just for fronting part, as you can see.

54
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,400
Let me scroll upwards.

55
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,150
This is just for printed part.

56
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,700
I'm going to develop this.

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,310
But in this I'm adding one more thing, which is basically using this GVC.

58
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,510
What I'm going to do, I'm going to fetch some data like these.

59
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,330
Select these IDs and everything.

60
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,460
I'm going to select and I'm going to create.

61
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,270
So in this part, I'm going to test this as connection.

62
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,700
That's really simple thing I'm going to do.

63
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,520
Let me show you how we can.

64
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,280
Create a connection.

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,300
Well, first, let me delete this connection, which I already created.

66
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,500
Okay.

67
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,320
So it is not deleting.

68
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,580
Okay.

69
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,930
So let me add one more thing here.

70
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,440
So why it is not deleting because it's currently under use.

71
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,050
So it's not deleting the disconnect first and let me do it.

72
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,670
So now you can not see anything here, but do your database.

73
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,110
Create a new connection.

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,890
No, you can.

75
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,800
You can do more because.

76
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,690
So this is Oracle.

77
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,520
Where is Oracle team?

78
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,630
Now you can see this is then I already added driver for this.

79
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,650
Please continue.

80
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,120
You can check for this x change this to your system name.

81
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,430
I in this for system only.

82
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,470
If you want to change, you can change.

83
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,030
And password is for creating connection.

84
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,640
Then you test connection.

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,010
You can see connection is like connection is there is a connection between this so no need to change

86
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,460
anything.

87
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,150
If you want to remember password next.

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,370
Then select ski mask.

89
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,500
Why is our system only fitting next?

90
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,620
System on default schema.

91
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,240
So you can say finish.

92
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,480
So now our database connection is finished within this.

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,920
So we don't need to create anything.

94
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,700
If you are deploying in a server like Heroku, you need to mention the protection which is basically

95
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,680
property XML in that file.

96
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,990
You need to mention Postgres dependency, which is related to that part.

97
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:01,350
But this is all the things how you can deploy or on this part.

98
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:09,880
So let us go to the test DB part, which is quite similar to this, which is select image from ID and

99
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm going to put this and I'm going to try and put in that part.

100
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,160
So that's it how I can do.

101
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:23,560
But this is again JSP And also if you want to create Java file, you can create for that purpose.

102
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,210
So.

103
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,490
Again, go to the upload for uploading part.

104
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,680
To this day and each and every day.

105
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,300
Upload image part I already created here so that should here.

106
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,700
And if you want to use you can use this directly.

107
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,390
Upload a pic and everything I mentioned already here.

108
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,800
So now let us go to project web pages.

109
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,630
So connect to global clean and be.

110
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,010
So let's go to window and click here.

111
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,220
Output, as you can see.

112
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,170
So what?

113
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,330
Okay.

114
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,580
Forcefully unregistered.

115
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,060
So I registered this part and will be successful.

116
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,260
Close this.

117
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,850
Now what I'm going to do.

118
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,070
I'm going to run this project.

119
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,070
So it will take time.

120
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,850
In my building successful.

121
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,930
So.

122
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,440
You would do this.

123
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay.

124
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,070
Now you can see my deployment is successful.

125
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,100
If I put your admin as my admin part, I can go to the admin page.

126
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,540
I hit enter to go to the admin page.

127
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:57,250
Sometimes you take time to scroll down through each part, but as you can see, this is loading part.

128
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,650
It's working very fine, very smooth.

129
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,340
Then this lock in place process.

130
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,080
And I'm going to specify this.

131
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,110
So if you want to check, you can check here or log process.

132
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,940
So this is the logging process.

133
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,410
Which is going to use your login process and which is going to deploy everything here.

134
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,030
Then currently I don't have anything there, so it's not showing me anything.

135
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,000
But if I go to the admin page again.

136
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,700
You can check if I'm using new user.

137
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,080
So login as admin support here admin.

138
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,020
I mean.

139
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,420
And it's log in page.

140
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,310
I'm going to go with to go.

141
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,390
So here is who I'm going to create this part.

142
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:06,260
So this is my admin page so chrome supports because I data is basically I mean this is the beautiful

143
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,950
thing I can go this is all the things that is the things and I can check for this register discourse,

144
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,890
your device, your area post report you can check here.

145
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,470
So that's it how I'm going to develop this for portal.

146
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,670
So Post Report is basically you are going to post the report with your app or anything you can do.

147
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,990
Like you can post your report pending executed, you can perform.

148
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,750
So I'm considering only your one country.

149
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,650
And two, if you want to add, you can add more.

150
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,880
Dropdown menu means if I hit logout it will be log out from my page.

151
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:56,080
Currently, my system is performing very heavy load obligations, so there may be some times in that

152
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,400
then administrator, if I enter new user method here, it will show me the new user.

153
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,770
You can add the new files.

154
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,360
Also, as you can see, this is all the things I can do.

155
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,040
Then there is one discourse forum.

156
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,760
Also, you can do your advice.

157
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,130
Also you can add your your area.

158
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,240
So this is just like old website for globe you can use your.

159
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,660
So let's see how we can develop this project.

160
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,440
If we want to add some more different things here, you can add.

161
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,190
It's your wish to add more things, but you can see please log in first.

162
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,100
You can do here.

163
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,800
Then if you status you have to view status and everything.

164
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,980
So that's it.

165
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,620
How we are going to perform this.

166
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,090
So I hope you understand this part in further.

167
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,280
So this is the full deployment of the server.

168
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,890
If you want to extend it more like you want to deploy on the servers, what you are going to do.

169
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,060
Heroku is one of the famous platform for this.

170
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,510
So let me show you this.

171
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,770
So Heroku is when I'm the cloud application platform, you can perform.

172
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,920
So this is the Heroku website you can perform.

173
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,470
So it supports many languages using these go by time and you can use Java.

174
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,270
So it supports which is basically Java web.

175
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,930
So what you are going to do, you have to sign up this first.

176
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,570
But let me go to the one thing here.

177
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,830
Which is basically documentation for part.

178
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:43,090
So in the documentation part, you can choose documentation for Java.

179
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,500
And in Java.

180
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,700
What are you going to do?

181
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,500
You are going to deploy.

182
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,930
Java apps on Roku.

183
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,090
So you can search HTTP port for Java applications.

184
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:03,810
You can do everything here, but remember you need to install Heroku CLI and my entry as I mentioned,

185
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,380
the three, you have to install that and you need to add some form or XML.

186
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,520
Everything is available on this Roku platform.

187
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:15,200
Once this is done, you can get the website and you can proceed with that part.

188
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,240
So this is it.

189
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,850
We are going to perform.

190
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,260
So I deployed it on the server, which is basically local, but if you want, you can level up on Heroku

191
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:31,850
platform, but it's needed my library, so we created a Connect Globe application using Java.

192
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,320
Hope you understand.

193
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,430
Thank you.
