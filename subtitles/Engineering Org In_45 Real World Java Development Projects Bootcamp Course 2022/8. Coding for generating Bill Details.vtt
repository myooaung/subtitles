1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.920
So here is the details or java file which is defined inside the package electricity.

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.670
We have imported the necessary pack of packages.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:17.140
Those are a swing scale and planet scale dot db utils.

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.740
This package is basically provided in this rs two example dot jar library.

5
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.190
So make sure that this is present in your library.

6
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.170
Section.

7
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.360
Now we have defined the building class.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.170
Which is extending from a table or table type of instance to even a string x, which is containing meter

9
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:50.590
number, month units, total blend status, and a string y which is of 48 array two dimensionality and

10
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.560
a string x is a single dimensional string y is a two dimensional array of a string type.

11
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.970
Now integer I and J set a set to zero belittles constructor is taking a parameter of a string type.

12
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.810
Now its headed will be set as build details, setting the size of the window, setting the location

13
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.220
of the window, layout as null background color as white, and the table initializing the table by providing

14
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.600
the two dimensional array y and x as the number of columns.

15
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.870
Now inside private block, we have established the connection.

16
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.300
As by using our broken class and a string select abstract from below where matrix equals to meet the

17
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.920
number and results that dot dots dot execute query.

18
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.800
So this statement will execute the query which we have written in as one is string.

19
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.670
Based on the meta number and its set model, it will set the model of the table for our window inside

20
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.420
the cache block.

21
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.970
The exception will be handled here.

22
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.710
We have defined the scroll pane.

23
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.220
Initialize the scroll pane for the table instance T1 setting the bound for the scroll pin and adding

24
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.500
that to scroll into our window.

25
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.210
Inside the main function, we have initialized the object of the building and setting its visibility

26
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.500
to true.

27
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.010
Now let's move to the next class, which is a generated build class.

28
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.590
So in this class we have defined it's inside the package electricity important, the necessary package

29
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.120
swing as well and JWT and JWT event defining the generated class.

30
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.070
It is extending frame and implementing Excel listener interface two types of label element and area

31
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.490
to one text area that is a one button of type button of instance name as given choice C to Japan LP

32
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.090
one and a string type of variable that is a meta generate build constructor is taking a parameter constructor

33
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.890
which is taking a meter that is a string type is string or type of variable setting the size for the

34
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.830
window layout as a border layout and P1 as initializing the new panel, initializing the new label as

35
00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.370
generated bill second label as the meter, which is the variable which will be passed during the calling

36
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.230
of this constructor or this class.

37
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.320
So that will be passed to the label two and C two as a choice which will contain all the months to get

38
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.320
selected for which the bill has to be generated.

39
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.740
This is generated which will be done by the admin actually.

40
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.290
So t one is a new text area.

41
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.900
Inside the text area we have written some text that is the generate bill button to get the bill select

42
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.610
to the month.

43
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.250
So scroll panel, JSP type.

44
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.720
It is a scroll panel, a scroll pane for the table, even setting the font of the table generating.

45
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:45.200
There is a button that is state as generated, adding L1, L2 and C2 to the panel and adding the panel

46
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.330
to a window to the north side of the window and the JSP to the center.

47
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.330
JSP is a scroll pane for the table, so that will be fixed at the center and the button at the south

48
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.050
position.

49
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.720
So now we want zealousness.

50
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.730
So we have added the action listener to our button and setting the location for the window.

51
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.810
Now what happens when the button generate will will be pressed.

52
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.740
So connection will be created first of all, with the database and from the See to Choice option, we

53
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.740
will select the item that will be month which is being selected and even dot set text.

54
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.530
So it will send the text of inside the table.

55
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.520
Reliance, Power Limited.

56
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.650
That is a simple text and after that we will execute the result of the query that is select aspect from

57
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.980
customer.

58
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.540
Well meter is equal to meters, so this will fetch the data of the customers where for which the meter

59
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.220
number will be similar.

60
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.790
And for the next row in the database it will append in table the these details.

61
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:55.020
So in day one it will append these details like customer name, customer name get by getting name from

62
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.460
the database meter number by getting meeting meter from the database.

63
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.060
Similarly, address is state city email phone number and this will be a similarly dotted line for the

64
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.830
format and the new line.

65
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.630
In the table.

66
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.810
So this is how the bill will be generated.

67
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.770
Now, in the results set, there is another query we have issued select asset form meta info where meta

68
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.720
number is because now it will fetch the record from the meta info table where the meta number will be

69
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.340
seen again.

70
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:34.660
Iterating on the next row for that table in the database, it will append the meta location, meta type,

71
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.730
phase, code, build type and days and the new line the table t one.

72
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.190
Now from the tag section, it will similarly fetch the cost per unit meta rent service charge, service

73
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.270
stacks, such policies and fixed attacks.

74
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.340
Then it will append the new line.

75
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.020
Similarly, for the build section, check for the meter and for the month, which is selected from the

76
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.740
choice section and if asked next.

77
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:10.690
Similarly, it will fetch the record for month units total bill and it will append the total table bill

78
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.210
for resort get string total bill from the database now.

79
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.310
If any exception occurred, then it will be handled by the catch block inside the main function.

80
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.390
We have created a new generate will object with settings visible to.

81
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:38.650
Now the last Java file for our this project inside the electricity package that is last built on Java.

82
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.190
So this is defined inside the electricity package.

83
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.370
We have imported the required packages, a WWT event, swing and SQL.

84
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:54.300
So the last bill extends J frame and implements the Excel listener class j label l1g.

85
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.740
Text Area t one.

86
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.140
J Button one and Choice seven and Penelope one instance.

87
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.880
These are the instances and the last constructor is a non parameter constructor.

88
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.860
So setting the size for the window, first of all frame and setting the layout as a border layout,

89
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.940
initializing the panel, initializing the element that is a label.

90
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.960
L1 is a label labelled as Generate.

91
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.260
Bill seven is a choice and the choice is.

92
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.490
Here.

93
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.590
And it has this these numbers and these are the choices.

94
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.860
Stephen.

95
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.950
What next?

96
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.730
New Jade text area.

97
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.810
So it is a text area initialized here.

98
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.660
Scroll pane initialized on the basis of the T1.

99
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:48.980
That's the table setting the font for the table font, family font type and font size new button that

100
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.270
labeled as general table.

101
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:59.510
B one dot ad label, adding label to the panel, adding label, adding choice to the panel setting adding

102
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.150
the panel into the frame to the north side setting.

103
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:10.250
The JSP can scroll up into the center and adding the button to the south and B1 add action listener

104
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.150
adding the extension to the button and setting the location of the.

105
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.740
Different window now inside the action performed.

106
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.800
We had first established the connection inside the trie block executing the query select aspect from

107
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.160
MP where meter number is.

108
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.140
Seven Don't get selected item.

109
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:44.700
So here we have selected the customer from name meter, number X, address, state, city, email and

110
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.460
phone and appended the next.

111
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.410
This is a formatted line and appended the next line.

112
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.190
Now details of the last will.

113
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.690
It is appended in the table.

114
00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.860
Next query is select extract from build where meter number is goes to seven get selected item it rated

115
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:08.630
on that result set query from the build where meter number will be matched from the selected item and

116
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.810
even not append.

117
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.940
It goes to start string month.

118
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:20.220
Getting a string for the month from the bill database and getting a string as amount from the bill database.

119
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.060
So this will be generated the last bill of for particular customer.

120
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.100
Now catch block will work as catching the exception.

121
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:37.350
And here is the void main function which is the setting forming the last bill object and setting its

122
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.450
visibility to true.

123
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.180
So these are the three Java classes.

124
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:49.030
First will be build details, which is showing the details how an admin user can check its build details

125
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:54.820
and the generate build will be generated by the admin used by the admins to generate the bill for any

126
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.100
particular customer using the meter number.

127
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:03.940
And the last bill is used by the customer to check its last bill, paid or not.

128
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.490
So these are the last three classes of this project.

129
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:16.380
In the next video, we will learn about we will know about the running of this program and we will see

130
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:22.710
how it is running and working on these models, which we have just discussed in the previous videos,

131
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.750
like all these classes.

132
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.250
So we will try to run and check how it is running.
