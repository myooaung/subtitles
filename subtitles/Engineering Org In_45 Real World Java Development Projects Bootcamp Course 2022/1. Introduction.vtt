WEBVTT
1
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.660
Our project is employing management systems.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.800
So we are going to create one platform with platform, we are going to create a full employment management

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.460
system.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.650
So I'm going to create one simple platform for that.

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.990
You can enhance it more, but sometimes instead I'm going to go with some simple management, so simple

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.700
with database, Java, Spring Framework and how we can implement all Java object oriented programming

7
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.900
here in this.

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.290
So our framework is Java Spring, which is basically my main framework, and we are going to see how

9
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
we can incorporate database with Java speed.

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.550
So while proceeding further, I'm not going to use any servlet concept.

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.730
I'm going to use your pure Mavin concepts here so we will learn that later.

12
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.310
So our project Aim.

13
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.870
It's employment.

14
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.430
So let us see how we can create our project first.

15
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.380
So.

16
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.350
And this is my idea.

17
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.850
So I'm going to use this.

18
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.620
First, I will tell you what, how we can set up our project first.

19
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.150
So let me change this to lighting.

20
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.170
So it could be more readable.

21
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.110
So you can change your color teams.

22
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.640
Also, according to your performance, I'm going with lighting and go to projects.

23
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.840
Once you go to projects, you can see this project and you can create a new project.

24
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.730
Because I haven't created anything till now.

25
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.180
Likewise, I already created, but I deleted in recent.

26
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.550
You can check your recent projects also here, or you can branch GitHub for GitHub.

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.120
You can open it or click no new project here.

28
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.780
So wait for some time.

29
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.960
It will create a new project for you.

30
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.630
So I will tell you what we are going to do here.

31
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.290
So wait for some time.

32
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.100
Once you are done with this, you will see this dialog box will be open and go to here.

33
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.010
Java Spring Initialize.

34
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.180
I am using

35
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.440
Java or Intel for the religion.

36
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.810
Like that's educational purpose.

37
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.020
But if you are not using this, go to this website server you are in.

38
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.920
You can see start out sprinkled in the web, in your web.

39
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.950
I will tell you how we can proceed with that also and give the name for project.

40
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.600
So.

41
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.610
Let me give the name for project.

42
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.860
Well, I'm giving the name of my MP.

43
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.240
So this.

44
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.690
So.

45
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.660
MP So it's Java then Marvin.

46
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.950
Then if you want to change, I'm going to change your my package.

47
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.500
Like group basic group is MP.

48
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.450
So package name is as it is.

49
00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:01.370
Artifact does your Java 16 and Java version not only jar capacities, it's next.

50
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.570
So it will create your next choose to one stable version currently spring stable spring 2.5.3 so we

51
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.470
can then i need spring dose devtools then go to scale.

52
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.610
I'm going to use your my skills so I'm adding my spin driver.

53
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:30.940
It's choosing any other use that and spring data GPA or if you want to add some vapor so you can act.

54
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.770
But I'm not adding because I will create that later.

55
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.240
So my suggestion is currently don't add anything, just add dependencies, putting good tools, my skilled

56
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.870
driver and spring data if you click finish here.

57
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.690
So it will take time and it will create a new project of spring for you.

58
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.970
So while it's creating, let us see.

59
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.420
How we can perform or how we can implement other things here.

60
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.880
So in licensing, project AIM is to develop a web application for employee management system.

61
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.610
Steps of development is project setup that we are currently project services just like this one.

62
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.440
Understanding different tools what we are going to use here.

63
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.670
Then some java basic concepts or what is the oops thing, how java is going to work here and everything.

64
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.510
Then.

65
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.260
There are different also stages java hibernate for database.

66
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.460
My skill is how going to work some java web interface, so I'm going to incorporate that in the database.

67
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.540
Everything I'm going to teach you.

68
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.700
So that's our employee system.

69
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.850
Then application requirements that will do.

70
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.570
You should have some Java basic knowledge.

71
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.280
Java Spring.

72
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.110
Java Web Development Tools.

73
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.030
I'm going to use your JDK 16 Inside Intel Spring Initialize.

74
00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:00.160
You can use my school database if you are not familiar with Intel idea, you can choose any other platform

75
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.130
for that purpose.

76
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:10.490
There is Spring ID also available for the spring development, so I will show you how the spring initialized.

77
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.070
If you don't have that intel idea, I will tell you how you can.

78
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.770
Go with this feature.

79
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.660
So go to your any browser search for this star dot spring dot.

80
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.230
This is very helpful to create any project.

81
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.460
Then same.

82
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.650
Go to my main, then java.

83
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.110
Don't choose snapshots version because these are not stable.

84
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.100
Virgin then hit 2.51 to use the package name.

85
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.220
Then if you're 16 virgin, you can choose your dependencies from here.

86
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.000
That's so you can add spring routes.

87
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.990
Then add.

88
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.160
As I told you, for this purpose we need you can add theme live also.

89
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.560
So I forgot to add.

90
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.910
I will add it later.

91
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.500
That theme loop and everything.

92
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.690
Or then.

93
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.230
I need you also so you can choose any other thing here.

94
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.560
My school drivers and everything.

95
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.860
Once you are done with dependencies, as I told you, hit, generate here, generate.

96
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.030
It will give you the file or sorry, zip file or file.

97
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.400
You can extract it and open it with your ID so that you can do with this.

98
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.270
And this is our application requirement.

99
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.290
So for thing I will tell you how we can go with the basic knowledge.

100
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:45.120
Java basic is very easy thing you can do actually because Java I'm telling you, Java consider between

101
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.330
three basics.

102
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.330
One is JVM guide and GTK.

103
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:56.270
JVM is basically Java virtual machine is Java runtime environment and it's just a Java development.

104
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.250
So this is basically Java JDK structure.

105
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.650
So these are not very important.

106
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.810
But important thing is our spring initialization is working on JVM.

107
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.700
So I'm going to tell you how we are going to deploy it on the server and everything later.

108
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.390
But this is very important.

109
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.110
You should learn some JDK and also then Java methods and classes.

110
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.460
It's very useful for any thing.

111
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.600
Object oriented, everything is.

112
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.280
Java is associated with classes along with attributes and methods.

113
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.380
So consider a real life example.

114
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:38.620
God is an hour object and some attribute sets weight and color, but it has some default things also

115
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.100
like weight and meters, also like drive and break.

116
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:47.830
So you can consider classes, an object constructor or blueprint for the creating objects.

117
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:54.040
So object is basically used to class or execute particular class basically.

118
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.380
So object is for the calling purpose of classes in Java.

119
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.490
So methods are declared in the classes.

120
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:06.510
It contains code for particular functions like as I told you for driving of car.

121
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.590
You need a code for driving a car.

122
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.210
Not really.

123
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.130
You are creating a simulation.

124
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.220
You need to create a code for driving a car.

125
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.050
So for that purpose you need a code.

126
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.420
So that code is considering one function and function refer to the methods in Java.

127
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:27.910
So methods contains written values access specify are some default attributes also sometimes.

128
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.920
So these are the things as object of classes are created to access methods.

129
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.810
So you can use object to access method.

130
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.320
So it's.

131
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.770
That particular object for accessing the metals also.

132
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.690
So this is it about the all the intro.

133
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.390
I will tell you how we are going to set up the thing and everything in later part.

134
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:51.250
But let us check our set.

135
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.800
So let me show you.

136
00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:01.480
So it's currently reformatting and doing everything in code so you can see already some additional things

137
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.230
are added.

138
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:08.320
Let me add one more thing here, which is basically team live dependency.

139
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.550
So I will tell you how we can add dependency.

140
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:17.530
It's very, very easy thing in Java MAVEN project because we are having one.

141
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:26.440
Which is basically bombed out India, which is very easy thing once you know about that part also.

142
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.370
You will understood that this very easy thing.

143
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.640
So let me add one dependency, which is basically timely.

144
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.480
So this is my getting started page.

145
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.650
Just close this.

146
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.010
It is.

147
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:55.380
Help me find you can see everything are already added here to compound XML, which is basically properties

148
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.150
of our thing.

149
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.650
So you can check here.

150
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.410
Some dependencies are already added.

151
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.270
My skill and everything.

152
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.260
So.

153
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.850
It's taking time to indexing and doing that stuff.

154
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.600
So wait for some time when it's finished.

155
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.080
As you can see, it's currently doing that work.

156
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.690
So let me tell you.

157
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.620
What is this, a Java framework?

158
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.670
First, because we already created a spring project and everything.

159
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.820
But what is the Java Spring framework?

160
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.540
So Java Spring is nothing but you can.

161
00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.410
They like the light framework screen, which is used to mostly create web platforms.

162
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:09.630
So it contains some already established frameworks like e.g. JSP, Hibernate, everything.

163
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.580
So you can say like that, it's a framework of frameworks.

164
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.560
So all frameworks are added in spring and now you can use the spring framework.

165
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.810
So that's the framework in border.

166
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:27.750
Since you can like that, it is a structure to find a solution of different kind of technical problems.

167
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.470
So when you are developing solid, you will understood.

168
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:37.260
We are currently writing too many lines of code to face the data and everything, so in this we are

169
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.910
not going to use that techniques.

170
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.060
So I will tell you how we are going to use that.

171
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:50.400
It's basically contents of several modules like JSP, JPA, MVC, which is basically web mapping and

172
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.480
everything already.

173
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:57.150
So now let me move to the ID part.

174
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.220
So this is my property dot XML.

175
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.840
As you can see here.

176
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.610
So.

177
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.890
Let me minimize this.

178
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.400
So you can see here some dependencies are already added.

179
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:19.330
But let me add my team, live dependency team is nothing but I just adding this dependency and it will

180
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.320
indexing that part.

181
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.210
It will directly download that dependency.

182
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.560
For me, team live is nothing but for the frontend part.

183
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.910
Like if you are using some a new syntax in HTML it will default.

184
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.880
Delete that part and it will work for you.

185
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:42.160
But regardless of that team, life is very beautiful thing because it's HTML more pretty file.

186
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.160
You can see our analyzer team live basically.

187
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:51.610
So it will it will allow you to add some direct bootstrap things in spring.

188
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.490
So it's good to add to dependency.

189
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.200
I forgot you can directly add from.

190
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.700
That part also.

191
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:08.070
So it will analyze dependency for me so you can see your my venting and it's give me one warning, which

192
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.290
is.

193
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.310
You're only.

194
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.900
So you can check your warning.

195
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.340
And it's an upgrade.

196
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.500
You can upgrade this.

197
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.710
No.

198
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.240
It should.

199
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.210
Not giving any.

200
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.020
Warning for me.

201
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:42.400
So okay, so why I'm focusing on pom pom dot XML because this is very basic thing you have to choose

202
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:50.420
because while deploying this project on anything like any server or local server, it will first bomb

203
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:56.950
dot XML and it will check that that server side part will check that whether already all dependencies

204
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:57.820
are added or not.

205
00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.780
So that's for this.

206
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:07.090
So once this is done, ignore this all get ignored and everything ignore these things which are important.

207
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.850
POM products will go to SLC.

208
00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.160
You can choose your different.

209
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:17.080
Folders like you can see here, different folders mean on an artist.

210
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.030
Go to Main.

211
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.140
You can see two folders, Java and resources.

212
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.860
So resources is basically for application properties.

213
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.440
I will tell you how we are going to use your application properties, but it will contain the front

214
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.170
end part and Java will contain all the back end parts.

215
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:41.340
So as you can see when already thing is added here, which is basically main, we never, ever try to

216
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.360
change this part.

217
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:49.830
Because if you are not interested in to change the development part or you can initialization part.

218
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.270
Never change this part because it will automatically initialize your classes.

219
00:15:54.420 --> 00:16:00.660
So what we are going to create in further videos or further tutorials, we are going to learn how we

220
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:07.050
can create sub packages here, which is regarded to model sources then different things, sources,

221
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.910
also services also we are going to add.

222
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:18.030
So we are going to add some modules here, Java classes, which are programs to create UI, create backend,

223
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.620
access the database and everything.

224
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.150
Hope you understand.

225
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:27.220
We will see further more details about our project in next year.

226
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.530
Hope you understand.

227
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.220
Thank you.
