1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.540
Okay.

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.440
So here I will write system, not print.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.130
Alan.

4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.200
Okay.

5
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.920
Yes.

6
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.390
Simply system.

7
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.650
No, down, not print.

8
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.310
Alan.

9
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.340
Here, I will start with the backslash d greater than symbol.

10
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.650
You strike.

11
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.120
No, we have.

12
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.140
Just put the sentence.

13
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.560
You have taken too much damage.

14
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.760
So simply just try.

15
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.230
You have taken too much damage.

16
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.270
You have taken too

17
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.850
much damage.

18
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.840
And.

19
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.360
You are too weak to play the game.

20
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.110
Okay.

21
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.830
So this will show.

22
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
So what we will do here after this?

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.440
Just simply semicolon.

24
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.060
Okay.

25
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.570
And just simply break it.

26
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.120
Okay.

27
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.260
Okay.

28
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.320
So here I simply write.

29
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.220
You have taken too much damage and you are too weak to go on or to play the game.

30
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.940
So this is a little check here if our health goes and then what we are going to do is we are going to

31
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.570
say break to stop the game.

32
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.000
It will simply exit out.

33
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:55.090
So this big break statement here is going to break out this wine loop, the wine loop burn.

34
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.750
Okay.

35
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.260
So it's going to bring us down.

36
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.920
And so it's because I have got across.

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.480
Okay, so we are down.

38
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.100
Yeah.

39
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.680
So what happens when you die?

40
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.870
It's going to say you have been defeated and whatever the right.

41
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.460
Okay, so whatever.

42
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.900
So, so let's go ahead and finish the other inputs first of all.

43
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.490
So for the input to.

44
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.540
Okay.

45
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.360
So here for the input to here

46
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.690
and for the input two, we are going to drink health potion, right?

47
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.910
So one is going to be pretty simple.

48
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.380
So we are going to say we need us f statement here.

49
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.270
Numb health potions is greater than zero here.

50
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.940
So what it will do first, right?

51
00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:01.420
And then simply explain UK Health Potion which will keep you numb.

52
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.870
Health potions.

53
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.460
Minus minus.

54
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.610
Just simply write system.

55
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.140
Not our dot trend, Len.

56
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.820
And here in this I will take your drink.

57
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.940
Health potion.

58
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.540
It's.

59
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.590
Yourself for?

60
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.760
A close

61
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.530
held ocean.

62
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.310
Cookie.

63
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.250
We need the health potion.

64
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.670
Okay, just to heal a moment and just simply here, I will put.

65
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.360
Not the other things we need.

66
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.320
Done here.

67
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.340
Okay.

68
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.890
But now we need to show our.

69
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.890
We need to show our health also here.

70
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.960
So, backslide.

71
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.330
Backslide.

72
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.030
Okay, you.

73
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.850
Your.

74
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.930
Current.

75
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.150
Health.

76
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.450
And.

77
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.720
How do we pull?

78
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.340
Which we do.

79
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.700
What we are doing.

80
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.680
Firstly for the input here.

81
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.880
Here we are going to drink a health potion.

82
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.930
This one going to be pretty simple.

83
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.560
So here we are going to say if our number of health potion, remember, that's a variable up here.

84
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.820
Here.

85
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.090
Hmm.

86
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.350
How many?

87
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.380
Health potions, how many health potions we have.

88
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.440
So if the number of health potions here is the.

89
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.150
Greater than zero.

90
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.920
That is, we have a health potion.

91
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:43.490
Then we can go ahead and simply say health plus equals to the health potion, the player amount.

92
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.530
So we are going to add on to our health the amount that the health potion yields so far.

93
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.370
We need to do the minus the number of health potions from our current inventory.

94
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.980
So the health potion minus minus.

95
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.150
So here simply going to minus one from the collection.

96
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.170
So to make sure we have actually used it and we are not sort of keeping them and infinitely using them,

97
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.490
then we are going to add a feedback, print out to our user.

98
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.940
It will show to to them to know what they have done.

99
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.730
And against this we formatted this.

100
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.770
So here I will say you drink a health potion for yourself.

101
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:38.180
Yourself for the, let's say, the exam on the health portion amount we have and we concatenate with

102
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.180
the system, not all the different allein and just the tab and the next line

103
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.950
here though.

104
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:58.700
So here you will see your current health or the the drink help portion healing yourself and the next

105
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.630
thing which we need your current health portion.

106
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.400
Okay, so the amount of health we have actually have and then the HP.

107
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.180
So it says you have healed yourself for X amount.

108
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.020
Okay.

109
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.910
I will just simply change this sentence and just it.

110
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.980
You have.

111
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.580
Heal yourself.

112
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.190
4x1, and now you have five a month of health.

113
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.820
Can you just see?

114
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.070
We?

115
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.370
And now you have.

116
00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.680
You have.

117
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.440
What I have to say.

118
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.590
See, you have.

119
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:10.800
We've.

120
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.770
And.

121
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.470
The amount of.

122
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.730
Just remove this.

123
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:31.790
Okay.

124
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.500
So just.

125
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:37.880
Okay.

126
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:43.400
So here we are going to tell them how many positions they have left.

127
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.470
So now I'm held position.

128
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.440
Hand pushing left and then backslash.

129
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.920
Okay.

130
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.550
So we will just here.

131
00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:00.850
I will write the condition of NS.

132
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:15.220
The standard dart print are linear and just simply write backslash d greater than symbol and you have.

133
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.840
New health potions left.

134
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.540
Just simply write the feed.

135
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.830
Your enemies for a chance.

136
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:41.690
Got one?

137
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.740
Right.

138
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.430
So we have got it with that.

139
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.660
So if we are going to tell them how many options they have here.

140
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.280
Right.

141
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:03.240
So when they have number health, potion health.

142
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.280
So they have no health potion left.

143
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.740
So here I will write a new line here and give a little feedback information.

144
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:19.660
So user, if they use a health potion, firstly, check if there is a health potion available and we

145
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.240
are held on that or the amount that heals for on to our health.

146
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:33.760
And then we take away from one the inventory and we give this we give them this nice feedback here saying

147
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.660
that you have seen you have healed yourself for the X amount and now you have the right amount of health.

148
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.420
Now you have that amount of health potions left.

149
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.530
Okay.

150
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.180
So after that, we need to.

151
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.040
We have not created for this side.

152
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.450
Backslash and the.

153
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:04.690
Okay.

154
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:21.460
So here I will write you have you have just simply numb held portions and simply write portions left.

155
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:22.440
Okay.

156
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.830
Just make the new line after that.

157
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.660
Okay.

158
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.710
So.

159
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.920
Hmm.

160
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.470
So we have done with this part.

161
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:45.260
So here, the little feedback it will show you have healed yourself for X amount and now you have y

162
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.270
amount of health and now you have that amount of health portion left.

163
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.530
Now we have go ahead and add an L statement here.

164
00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.770
And it simply in the case the user does not actually have any health portion left.

165
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.330
And it is going to be.

166
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:10.950
System no doubt that println and it will say we are going with the backslash t greater than symbol.

167
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:17.700
Then we are going to say you have no health potion left and then I'm going to say defeat enemies.

168
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.000
Defeat your enemies for a chance to get one because we have not added it yet.

169
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:31.500
But the MacInnes mechanic is for when we defeat an enemy there is going to be a random chance of random,

170
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.680
just not mandatory terms.

171
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:41.460
It will be a random chance that there is a percentage chance, a random chance for an enemy to drop

172
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:47.520
a health potion that is going really we have got a lot of code in here now.

173
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.580
We are going to go all over it at the end, though, in case you missed it in.

174
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.200
Firstly run that first.
