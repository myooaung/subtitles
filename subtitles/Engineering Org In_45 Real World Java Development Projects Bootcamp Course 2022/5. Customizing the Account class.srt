1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,210
So yes, we were discussed discussing about the checking deposit input method, like getting the deposit

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:17,670
input and the try and catch block exception handling methods were being called and these were asking

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,480
for amount to be deposit in the checking accounts.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,680
So there are some conditions to be checked before depositing any amount, whether it be the checking

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,460
deposit account or the savings deposits.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:41,760
So yes, it is going to check like the checking balance and amount which we are willing to deposit is

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,810
greater than zero and the amount which we are going to deposit is also greater than zero.

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,590
So the combined sum of the balance and the amount and the specific amount should be greater than zero

9
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,400
as a whole.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,290
And then it is going to like calculate the checking deposit amount.

11
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:09,930
So suppose if we have 10,000 already and we want to deposit 2000, then it is going to like calculate

12
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,650
everything.

13
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,030
We have used this calculator method for deposit.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,740
So yes, it is going to calculate everything and then output the current savings account balance which

15
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,800
will be a sum of the deposited money and the current balance.

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,450
So yes, this is going to output the overall balance after the deposit and the LS block is going to

17
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,640
return like the balance.

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,230
If becomes less than zero then this if will not execute it and this LS block will execute it inside

19
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,270
this overall block.

20
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,280
And this is going to show that balance cannot be negative.

21
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:02,460
Suppose that you have already 1000 in your account and you want to like deposit some negative number.

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:10,620
Like suppose you want to deposit -2000 to your account, then the overall balances become -1000, which

23
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,720
is not possible at all.

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:23,160
The balance cannot be negative at any cost, so these things are kept in mind before depositing or withdrawing

25
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,750
money from the system.

26
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,460
So yes, this is all about a savings to draw.

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,850
Similarly, we have checking deposit.

28
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,090
So in the similar way we were checking everything with the try block and cash block.

29
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,280
We are checking here in the same way, like we are checking the balance.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,270
Whether the sum is like combined sum is greater than zero and the amount we are willing to deposit is

31
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,860
greater than zero or not.

32
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,820
If yes, then it is going to like system drawdown print and then the current checking account balance

33
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,140
we have like operated everything initially.

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,370
This is.

35
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,060
Yes.

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:14,100
So after the deposit the balance is going to be like current savings account balance and this is going

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,550
to be returned in this manner only.

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,280
So yes, this is the output we are receiving.

39
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,840
So yes, so everything is written in the code blocks.

40
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,610
Yes.

41
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,260
Inside these giant catch blocks, we have commands for everything in case.

42
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,600
If there are any exception, then it is going to return invalid choice.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,490
Like suppose you are inputting some alphabetical things in the Romney choice option.

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:57,070
Then it is going to like output invalid choice and if the balance is negative then it is going to stop

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,390
this if block execution and this block is going to execute simply.

46
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,080
And we have already covered this invalid choice.

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,860
So, yes, the next concern is to get that deposit input.

48
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:17,980
So a separate function we are going to create public void get.

49
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,400
Checking import.

50
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,530
So checking deposit input.

51
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,630
Yes.

52
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:36,560
The second one and this checking deposit input is going to be responsible for like checking the kinds

53
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,630
of exceptions arising in the depositing part of the checking account.

54
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,530
Like we have two types of accounts, the checking channel savings accounts.

55
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,960
So we are handling both of them separately or we are handling the withdrawal and deposit part separately

56
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
for both of them.

57
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:09,080
So initially sending the end of false and a while loop is going to be executed like before end of this

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
process.

59
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,160
What what is going to be performed.

60
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:22,790
So a tri block of course which is going to check that everything is correct or not.

61
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:34,730
So this out and this is going to backslash n display the current savings account balance.

62
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,720
So we are checking it for the checking account.

63
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,720
So it is going to display the checking account balance.

64
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:53,570
So checking account balance and avoid any kind of typos.

65
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,210
I will fix this.

66
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,950
And then all of the typos will be fixed.

67
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:10,120
And then, yes, so the current balance will be displayed and this is going to be done in the form of

68
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,720
money, formalities and dot format.

69
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,110
What is the argument we are going to pass?

70
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,320
This is going to be that checking balance.

71
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,760
Yes, this.

72
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,460
So we are done with this.

73
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,810
Unlike us, this outing.

74
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:36,080
Now, the next concern is to ask the user the amount they want to.

75
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,940
Deposit to their checking account.

76
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,590
So now, after asking the user about the amount they want to deposit into their savings accounts.

77
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,310
Okay, so this is the checking account.

78
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:00,530
We will be replacing this savings account right now and then doing the same for the checking accounts

79
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,180
also.

80
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,500
So get saving deposit input and then it is going to cut end savings account balance.

81
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,550
Like display the balance.

82
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,590
Then ask the user with the amount to be deposited.

83
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:22,090
And then it will be simply add the current balance to the amount which is going to be deposited and

84
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,460
add that whether it is yes, greater than zero or not.

85
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,960
In the similar way we were checking it for the checking deposit input.

86
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,040
So yes, this is done like this now after this.

87
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,400
Okay.

88
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,170
So this boolean then.

89
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,640
Get a savings account.

90
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,600
Savings deposit?

91
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,220
Yes.

92
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:55,480
So there is no lack of a brace or maybe extra.

93
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,680
So yes, this is going to display the current savings account balance.

94
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,750
If everything is fine, that is no exception.

95
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:15,040
Then this if block is going to be executed and if this is not the case, I suppose the balance is less

96
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
than zero.

97
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,570
The sum or this, like both of them are executed together.

98
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,520
Any of one becomes false.

99
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:31,030
Then the complete statement is going to be like an exhibit and the cells block will be executed.

100
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:38,380
So both of them should be true in order to make this if statement run properly.

101
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,020
So savings amount and amount.

102
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,740
Suppose they become negative, they are less than zero.

103
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,310
Then this else block will be executed and and it prints balance cannot be negated.

104
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,550
So we have to keep in mind these things.

105
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,750
Yes.

106
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,220
Okay.

107
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,740
The next step is to execute a catch block.

108
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:07,180
Getting that transfer input is also one of the major concerns inside this account.

109
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:15,430
Plus, we are done with the saving deposit input, checking deposit input and saving withdraw input

110
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,130
and checking withdrawal so all four of them get methods are covered.

111
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,320
Now the fourth one is to get the transfer input.

112
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:33,280
So public void get transferred input.

113
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,520
Is the next concern.

114
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,730
And inside this document, which is going to be passed initially, is the account type.

115
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,840
Like initially it is asking that type of account.

116
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:58,660
Like, let us firstly import the argument and then I will show you what actually this does.

117
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,130
So yes, this get transfer import is asking for that type of account.

118
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,230
And we can see that.

119
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,540
Yes.

120
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,130
So select an account you wish to transfer funds to.

121
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,210
So initially it is asking for a string input, which is going to be the types of account, whether it

122
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:27,690
be the checking account or if we are already in the checking account, then it will be asking for a

123
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,160
savings and exit.

124
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,640
So we have to choose from these two.

125
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,610
So this get transfer input is going to work in that way.

126
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:45,420
Boolean N in the similar way as the all the get methods we have covered till now.

127
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,850
And while.

128
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,000
North is equal to end.

129
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,640
Then this tribe lock will be executed.

130
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:07,200
Otherwise, if there is any kind of exception, then we will be having a separate like catch block also.

131
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,960
For catching the type of exception.

132
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,360
So inside the tribe lock we are going to.

133
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,190
The like.

134
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,570
Write the statement, check the account type.

135
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,050
So if the account type equals.

136
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,230
Let checking account then.

137
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,430
The outputs are going to be.

138
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,330
That way we will be looking at right now.

139
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,040
So this out.

140
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:53,950
So if we are in checking accounts, then a backslash and select an account you wish to transfer funds

141
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,260
to is going to be the.

142
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,990
Like message on your screens.

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,600
So yes.

144
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,630
This is the one.

145
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,000
Select an account.

146
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,490
You wish to transfer funds to.

147
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,740
Select an account.

148
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,970
You wish to transfer funds?

149
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,500
So.

150
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,080
Yes, so this is done in that way.

151
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,460
Okay.

152
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,730
So select ten type of account.

153
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:36,670
Now the next one is going to be the list of choices and the choices are going to be we will be like

154
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,810
copying this.

155
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,570
Okay, so firstly, let us.

156
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,330
Input the type of account string input containing savings.

157
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,440
And exit.

158
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,180
And after that backslash n with her choice.

159
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,300
So copying this two more times.

160
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,600
For the this ultimatum.

161
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,900
The second one is going to be exhibit.

162
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,300
If we are in the.

163
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,140
First there will be a f method, also a like elseif method.

164
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:23,760
If we are in the like checking account, we want to transfer funds to the checking account.

165
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,980
Then things are going to be different.

166
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:35,010
So, yes, this is going to be the three sets out for the choices like list of choices we are going

167
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,200
to have now in the next part.

168
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:45,550
We are going to declare integer choice variable for the type of choice.

169
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,000
User input.

170
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,790
So input dot next int.

171
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,920
Yes.

172
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,950
This is embedded like variable inside Java.

173
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,120
So yes, in choice input, next choice.

174
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,380
And then after this we are going to like initialize a switch case.

175
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:16,050
Suppose if user inputs like a one for the savings account, if they are in the checking accounts right

176
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,200
now and they want to say switch to transfer money to the savings account, then a switch case will be

177
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:29,520
executed in order to like ask the user what is the money they want to transfer and everything.

178
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,210
Now.

179
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,690
Yes, the switch gets executed.

180
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,610
The argument is choice.

181
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,830
So we have one too.

182
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:46,330
And the default case, the first case is asking that if they want to like transfer money to the savings

183
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:52,210
account and it is going to output the current account balance, then we'll ask for the money they want

184
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,340
to deposit to the savings account.

185
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:02,740
And then at the next step they will like output the present balance after the successful transfer.

186
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,380
So yes, the same train block we discussed above is the check there.

187
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:15,340
The balance should not be negative in any case, and invalid choices are also checked.

188
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,330
Our choices should be made very carefully.

189
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:26,230
Now, similarly, for this checking account type, the things are done in the similar way.

190
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:32,980
I have already discussed this about this as if we are checking the same thing for the savings account,

191
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,400
the types of account and everything is done in the similar way.

192
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,450
We have checked this for the checking account.

193
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:47,740
So yes, the string ex except type is going to be the similar for the savings account as well.

194
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:55,090
If they choose to transfer money to the checking account, then these will be the questions as to the

195
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,680
user what is going to be the type of account and the money they want to deposit.

196
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,180
And at the end the calculated balance will be displayed to the user that what they transferred and what

197
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,920
is actually left with them.

198
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,220
So this is all about the accounts class.

199
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,590
We have covered all the calculations required inside this now saving the next part.
