1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,920
So now in this else part, you're the number three was run.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,540
So our third option was to run.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,710
Now in this instance, we are going to give a feedback to the user telling when they run away and then

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,110
we are going to reiterate the loop and that's why we have the scheme loop here.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,120
This one, I will explain the reason in just a second.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,800
So in this case of the user typing in the number three, you are going to go ahead and do a firstly,

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:48,180
we will do a system or not print all in here and simply we are going to go ahead and say tab, just

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,480
try to you run away from the.

9
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,420
Simply write to me here.

10
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,550
Okay, then.

11
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,630
Okay.

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,390
So this just.

13
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,450
Okay.

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,220
So here we are going to go ahead and see you.

15
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,310
Let's see you run away from the enemy.

16
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,040
Here, the enemy of the the name of the enemy.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,620
And then add on the again.

18
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,620
The name is still in scope.

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,710
So we declare it all appear and we are still inside the same value.

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,800
See my look, this one.

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:46,120
So here we run away from whatever enemy it was and we will concatenate on the exclamation mark here

22
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,020
at the end.

23
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,950
So there is no now there is where we need to label.

24
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,560
We are going to continue working or what continue.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,190
Thus it moves to the next integration of the loop.

26
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,260
It says, okay, not everything.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:13,450
So firstly just add the label here which was the first continue and we have the label game here, right?

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,900
And the next thing.

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,420
Just here in the Els part blue.

30
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,260
This else would be this point.

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,300
Just go back to the start of the loop.

32
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,570
The problem is we're already inside of loop, okay?

33
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,560
And we don't want to go back and do this one because.

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,620
Hmm.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,520
Yeah.

36
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,040
One, one.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,660
Okay, so we.

38
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,460
We are in the combat loop.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,860
We are fighting the same enemy.

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,930
We are actually want to go one further back into the main game loop so we can generate a new enemy.

41
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,610
Okay.

42
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:09,390
So firstly here I will try it system not not print a linear.

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,450
Not not print Alan and just put invalid.

44
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,210
Come on.

45
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,360
Okay.

46
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,210
We have done the invited.

47
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,070
Come on, now.

48
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,180
Here it is.

49
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,300
I have already said we are already in the loop and we don't want to go back into this one.

50
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,330
We have already defined our three cases.

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,960
So one, because this is the combat law where we are fighting the same enemy.

52
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:01,290
We actually want to go one further up, back into the main game loop so we can generate a new enemy

53
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,510
and start the combat again.

54
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,400
So this label right here, this game label, we are labeling this.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,030
Okay, the final book.

56
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,010
Here.

57
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,350
Here, the main one, we are just labeling it game.

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:30,020
So when we come down and we can continue we can continue the game and then just for the label game.

59
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,230
Okay.

60
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:45,570
So we are currently in so we had come back up to here, go back to the here and.

61
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,080
Then we wouldn't be running from the army.

62
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,400
We would just be refreshing the whole combat cycle and we'd be offered the same options again.

63
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,400
And so by saying continue game here, we are going to break out of this loop here and we are going to

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,090
continue on.

65
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:12,950
It's going to find a new enemy and we forgot where we fought the enemy in the first place.

66
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,740
So that's why we have that label here.

67
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,830
So and that's a third option.

68
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:27,590
So the final statement, if the user did not type in one, two or three, if they typed in random stuff

69
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,870
or they didn't type a valid number.

70
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:39,900
So we are just going to give them simple feedback and we are just going to say invalid command or the

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,730
invalid input.

72
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,650
And this is fine just to say this because basically we managed to reach this.

73
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,730
LS Here, see invalid command we are going to go ahead.

74
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,350
It's because it's a while loop.

75
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,100
Nothing happens.

76
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,610
So we will head straight back up to the top.

77
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,980
We will just be offered the options again.

78
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:07,210
So the user has another chance to look at the options they have and then do whatever they want to do.

79
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,380
So we have got quite a lot going on here at the moment.

80
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,050
So we have started our menu, we have initialized the anime,

81
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:32,590
we have initialized the anime and we have said, well, the enemy's health is greater.

82
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,930
Okay.

83
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:44,240
So just start with the hand is greater than the zero.

84
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,980
We are going to offer the use of these options and.

85
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,640
Okay.

86
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,390
So we are going to offer the use of this option and then we are going to go ahead and get their input.

87
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:05,010
So we are going to go ahead and say if done equals two.

88
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,010
Okay.

89
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,950
So one of the the first one.

90
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,490
Firstly what it will do here.

91
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,370
Firstly, it will be equals first.

92
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:26,760
Here I will take the just we have initialize with initialize with the enemy.

93
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,620
We have said so.

94
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,040
We have said the while the enemy's health is greater than zero, we are going to offer the use of these

95
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,150
options here.

96
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:46,570
We are going to go ahead and get their input here and then we are going to go ahead and see what I will

97
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,140
say.

98
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,410
Okay.

99
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,600
So it will say attack.

100
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,870
So everyday equals the first one is the attack.

101
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,930
So the pick, the first one we are going to go ahead and attack.

102
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:09,350
But if it is equal to we are going to do here, we are going to do this if it is equal to three here.

103
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,390
So we are going to do this.

104
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,570
And so let's go ahead and come out of this loop.

105
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,910
Okay.

106
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,630
And.

107
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,160
Come out of this loop now.

108
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,320
Just making sure I've got the facts right now.

109
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,470
Okay.

110
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,020
This coming up, this file.

111
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,140
The first thing we are going to track for is once we are out here, we need to check why we broke out

112
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,920
this loop.

113
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,870
Did we break out the loop?

114
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:50,010
Out the loop because we defeated an enemy or did we break out because our health went to zero?

115
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,660
So you can see if our health is less than one.

116
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,390
We go ahead.

117
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,030
Okay.

118
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,700
And C break so we have broken out of.

119
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:01,790
Okay.

120
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:11,270
Firstly, I will start with this and I will say this certain one.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,980
Just make it one zero.

122
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,160
So here I will write this less than one.

123
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,040
Here I will write system, not dot print alone and under this.

124
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,410
Okay.

125
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,110
Just we will put the statement here.

126
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,380
You are too weak.

127
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,770
To lead the battle.

128
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,130
Okay.

129
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,340
And then just simply break the.

130
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,550
We have broken out of the loop right here.

131
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,070
So the first thing we are going to check is our player is dead.

132
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:22,280
You're going to see health is less than one and we are going to say system not out of print.

133
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:30,590
And it see, we are going to add a descriptive sentence such as anything you want to do, just simply

134
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:30,820
right.

135
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,540
You are too weak to play the battle.

136
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay, so there's the little thing that we do.

137
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,130
If our health is blue one, we say you are too weak to play the battle.

138
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,910
And then we go ahead and break the spell break.

139
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,080
There we go.

140
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,220
Okay, so break it.

141
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:53,000
So here we will break out of the main loop while running loop, and then it will come out.

142
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,180
Okay to why?

143
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:58,930
Okay.

144
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,990
So then it will come down here.

145
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,720
We're going to add some messages first.

146
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,990
Just simply write system, not dot.

147
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,370
Print a line here.

148
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,220
Just copy this print.

149
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,750
See?

150
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,720
Okay.

151
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,150
First.

152
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,990
Who's this?

153
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,190
Okay, just copy this.

154
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,610
Some of this astronaut outdoor talent.

155
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,060
Oh, exterminate.

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,650
We have the three.

157
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,030
Okay.

158
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,260
We have added these one.

159
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,650
This simply.

160
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,720
Make it long.

161
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,450
Okay.

162
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,890
Firstly.

163
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,420
We are going to add a message to.

164
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:29,630
And at the end we will say thanks for playing or something you like.

165
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,120
So the first thing we checked, if our health was less than one, we do the description and break up.

166
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,300
The loop over health was not less than one.

167
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:47,600
We have broke out and break out the loop and here it must have mean we defeated the enemy.

168
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,450
So we still have all the enemies.

169
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,210
Okay, so.

170
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,980
Firstly, I will start with the.

171
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,320
Just a minute.

172
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,250
I will firstly write.

173
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,520
And then.

174
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,050
I know this.

175
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,460
I will write.

176
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,720
Just use symbol.

177
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,330
I will use hash here.

178
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:38,180
Just simply write me those was Richard.

179
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:40,790
Okay.

180
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,890
Was defeated.

181
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,760
Just simply this.

182
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,680
Okay.

183
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,910
So the next one.

184
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,810
I know this.

185
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,870
We have to show.

186
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,680
Right.

187
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,080
You have.

188
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,080
And.

189
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,530
Plus.

190
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,760
And here I will write actually left.

191
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,290
Okay.

192
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,190
Just simply write this.

193
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:40,220
Just honored that options which we can have here is not what you.

194
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,180
Like to do not.

195
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,540
Okay.

196
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,340
So then.

197
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,210
And this.

198
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,540
I will give some names.

199
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,880
Continue fighting.

200
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,740
And I decided right to not accept again

201
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,280
and copy this and.

202
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,950
After this line just added.

203
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,750
Okay.

204
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,290
So we have checked our health was less than one.

205
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,570
We do the description and break of the look.

206
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:34,200
If health was not less than one, we have proved the loop broke out the loop and here it must have weaned.

207
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,540
We have defeated the enemy.

208
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:43,700
So we still have all the enemy state up here and it name and stop so we can use still them down here.

209
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,250
Remember, if we haven't, we have initialized them here.

210
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:54,690
We have done the whole combat loop and then we have OC so.

211
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:06,450
Firstly here I have concatenated the name of the enemy and was defeated.

212
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,940
Okay.

213
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,140
So you will see when we actually run this how formatting makes it look like.

214
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,150
So.

215
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,290
Next thing, the actual game for the user is fairly reasonable.

216
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,900
So we will add another print line here.

217
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,420
In this line I did not explain it.

218
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,410
We basically just added that formatting said army was defeated so the name of the enemy was defeated.

219
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:38,680
Go ahead and add some more formatting and we are going to tell them you have we are going to tell our

220
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,620
we are going to tell our player how much help so how much help they have left.

221
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,330
So you have left you have held HP left.

222
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,910
So we have told them they defeat the enemy.

223
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,490
We have told them how much HP they have left.

224
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,730
No.

225
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,760
So now we are going to go ahead and add a random drop chance.

226
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,180
So now we need our condition after this.

227
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,200
We just.

228
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,620
We have to add our chance.

229
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:19,130
So firstly, I will start, I will write and then simply explain that.

230
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:20,640
Okay.

231
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:31,650
So here I am in right or next end and just give the parameter to the 200 and just simplified option

232
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:39,210
or options under this the num health portions plus plus.

233
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,990
Simply write system.

234
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,720
Yeah.

235
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,020
System not print, Alan.

236
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,360
And under this what I can do.

237
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,200
It is simply the.

238
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,040
And anime

239
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,510
dropped health.

240
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,070
Bush.

241
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,890
And ocean here.

242
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,350
I'm just done.

243
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,480
System dot dot, print linear.

244
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,290
And now I will just simply write.

245
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,490
You have.

246
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,950
No health potions.

247
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,240
Portions.

248
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,420
Hmm.

249
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,050
Okay.

250
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,410
So then.

251
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,510
Okay.

252
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,840
So what I have done here.

253
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:11,440
We have not only we have defeated the enemy and how much HP we have now, we are going to go ahead and

254
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,110
just simply add our random drop chance.

255
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,870
Remember, we have a percentage here.

256
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,690
Here on this one.

257
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,340
The percentage, you are right.

258
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,050
So we are going to use we are going to use that percentage.

259
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,200
And here the health interruptions.

260
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,390
If we defeat an enemy, we want a 50% transforms, drop a health potion.

261
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,220
Again, you could change this percentage to whatever you want.

262
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,670
Okay.

263
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,460
So the question we are going to use here if.

264
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:54,900
Here what I will say just if our next then we are going to go in here.

265
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:01,980
I am right or not next end and then we are going to put 100 in is greater than health potion drop drop.

266
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,970
So firstly we are generating a random number between 0 to 100.

267
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:17,340
And if the random number is greater than the percentage chance, if the number is greater than the percentage

268
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,680
chance for drop and actually it should be less then not greater than.

269
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,700
Okay.

270
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:34,870
So if the number between not one 100 is less than the drop chance, it means the random number landed

271
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,280
in that area.

272
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,630
So it means making the number high will be more likely.

273
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:49,240
So if I make the drop chance, 99%, obviously a number between a random number, not a 100.

274
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,540
So highly likely to be less than 99, which means that the chance is higher.

275
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:03,720
And so I'm going to keep that 50 so you can change it and similarly say I will do ten.

276
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:12,250
A random number between not ten and 100 is much more likely to be greater than ten as opposed to less

277
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,850
than ten.

278
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,400
And so I will go ahead and change this.

279
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:22,260
And just say to the 50 so a percentage drop trumps work so inside.

280
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:30,810
Then if the statement here we can see health portion and just plus plus just add up the health portion

281
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:38,520
and we will add one health portion and we will give the feedback to the user they want to know they

282
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,200
have actually received or not.

283
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:48,540
So here I have at the end we dropped our health push and then we will just do some more useful feedback

284
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,350
for the player.

285
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:55,860
We will just tell them now the total number of health portions they have after the drop you.

286
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,590
So you have portion.

287
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,920
It could be ambiguous so we can just add the brackets.

288
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,110
Okay.

289
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:10,420
So we have added the health portion and give the user feedback.

290
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,900
So that's the random dropdowns for the health portion.

291
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,210
So we have said enemy was defeated, how much help they have left.

292
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,300
We have a randomizer drop off the healthier.

293
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:31,070
And told them if they have received one or we are going to go ahead and add a little separator here

294
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,060
and we are going to give the user some more option.

295
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:42,260
We are going to go ahead and say system not that println and we are going to say what would you like

296
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,980
to do now?

297
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:50,060
And we will have the two more options and we will first name it as the continue fighting and we are

298
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,540
going to have number two as the exit again.

299
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:59,140
So after we have every time we defeat an enemy, we are going to be presented with these two option

300
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,830
here, these two options.

301
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,640
So, so let's go ahead and do the same thing we did above.

302
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,490
And we are going to go ahead and get the string.
