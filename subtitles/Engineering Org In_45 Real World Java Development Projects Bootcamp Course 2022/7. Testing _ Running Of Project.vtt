1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.220
Okay.

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.530
So in the previous part, we have covered everything about this shape class and what this class is containing.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.840
So initially we were creating this circle and the rectangle class and of course the line class.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.280
So there was a red underline inside this x, y and everything.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:27.530
But when we like declared everything inside the shape class, then this is gone and now everything is

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.280
an entry.

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:38.210
We can say that and this x, y, w edge for the circle, the rectangle and the line are properly defined

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.540
now.

9
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.680
So now we are done with everything.

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.720
This panel, this top panel, the working of these buttons, we have added action business inside the

11
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.770
main class.

12
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.310
Now, the only thing which is left is this white space.

13
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.130
How this white space is going to work.

14
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.970
Like we are working on this white space with the help of motion of the mouse, we are moving our mouse

15
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.740
like dragging it from here.

16
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.450
And then in order to draw a line or to move a shape from one place to another, we are using our mouse

17
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.960
only.

18
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.320
So let us first create the drawing area Java class and then inside this the main focus which is going

19
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.260
to be like a mouse, motionless mouse.

20
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.480
So that class is going to listen to the movement of our mouse that where we want to locate the shape

21
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.950
inside the canvas.

22
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.900
Or we can say that the drawing area.

23
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.370
So let us first create the drawing area, not Java class.

24
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.770
So this is the name of the file drawing Java and on hitting enter we will end up inside this file.

25
00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.580
A public class drawing area is already created, so this is going to be a panel.

26
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.940
So we are going to extend it as G panel.

27
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.470
And yes, so already the import is made.

28
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:18.290
We do not have to import it on like manually just by hitting this panel, this import is made automatically

29
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.710
now what this panel is going to implement.

30
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.740
So this is going to implement the mouse motion listener.

31
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.180
And.

32
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.530
Mouse motion.

33
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.170
Listener and the mouse listener.

34
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.310
Two things.

35
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.490
So we will separate it with a comma.

36
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.790
And this is how it is going to work.

37
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.240
So, yes, we have implemented two functions inside this class drawing area.

38
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.060
Now we will be declaring some objects inside this class.

39
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.840
First one will be a ArrayList.

40
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.630
So this ArrayList is going to contain the shape.

41
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.070
Now, I will explain this in a moment that what is the role of ArrayList inside the drawing area?

42
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.830
Class So yes, this is going to be a shape and the name of this ArrayList is going to be shapes.

43
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.200
Okay.

44
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.390
So after this.

45
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.900
A few more things which are like needed to be initialized.

46
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.470
Here is static int press x.

47
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.610
That's why.

48
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.270
SEC x.

49
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.270
And sick boy.

50
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.590
So this is how it is done.

51
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.530
Now, you may be wondering that what is the role of analysts like we have used this to earlier in our

52
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.930
other projects also.

53
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.170
But what is the role of analyst in this growing area?

54
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.580
So we are adding shapes inside this drawing area and this addition is made one by one.

55
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.600
So we do not know in the beginning that how many shapes the user will like create inside this drawing

56
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.070
area.

57
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.400
So the ArrayList will basically contain all the shapes which are being inputted with the help of these

58
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.150
buttons.

59
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.330
So the ArrayList is only going to contain the shapes, and of course that list is resizable.

60
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.750
So in the beginning we do not know that how many shapes the user is going to like input inside the drawing

61
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.290
area.

62
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:47.230
So with the help of the list, we will be able to contain all the shapes without any exceptions.

63
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.990
I suppose if we use any array or list then we have to fix that size in the beginning.

64
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.490
But we do not know that how many shapes we are going to enter inside the drawing area.

65
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.240
So yes, the list is the perfect option for storing the shapes inside the drawing area.

66
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.190
And what is this?

67
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:16.030
Press X, Y and sec, x and set y is so like in order to draw any shape inside the drawing area, we

68
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:23.800
are pressing our mouse and then like suppose we are drawing a line, so we are pressing our mouse and

69
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.730
then like keeping dragging it to a position when we want to like keep the line long.

70
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.910
So that is a pressing point for the mouse and there is a releasing point for the mouse.

71
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:45.280
So if we are drawing a circle or a rectangle, then only we just have to press the mouse and then the

72
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.480
circle will be drawn.

73
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.620
But this is not the end point we have to share, like the circle in the correct place.

74
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.070
So in order to do so, we have to press a mouse.

75
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.670
Then we have to drag that circle and release the mouse at the position where we want to finally place

76
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.420
the circle.

77
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.330
So suppose initially the oval was drawn here.

78
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.670
We have to like drag this over to this place and then release our mouse.

79
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.940
So this is how this press and set is going to work.

80
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:23.290
The initial point of the image is going to be this x and where the mouse is being released, then this

81
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.380
is going to be the sex part now.

82
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.740
Okay, so the next part, we are going to create our drawing area constructor, of course.

83
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.310
So public drawing area.

84
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.040
And inside it, we are going to.

85
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.350
Yes.

86
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.480
Add mouse listeners.

87
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.340
So add a mouse listener.

88
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.050
Okay.

89
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.660
So this is the mouse listener and this is mouse motion listening.

90
00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.380
We have implemented both of the methods inside this drawing area constructed and the shapes which are

91
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.880
going to contain the shape inside this like whitespace.

92
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.590
So Mouse is going to listen that where you want to draw the shape and the shape will be then stored

93
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.650
inside the ArrayList, which is going to be like stored simply inside the white space.

94
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.040
Now, this drawing function is calling this a repaint method.

95
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:30.050
So this is simply doing the erase and redraw of any component.

96
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.150
After a small delay in time.

97
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:40.820
So basically this repaint is an asynchronous method in Java which we used to like request to the application

98
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:48.410
that we want to solve, like it is an image and then redraw something inside this white area, of course.

99
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.650
So yes, this is what this repaint function is doing.

100
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:58.370
Now we were discussing about graphics and like the import.

101
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:06.020
So you can see the graphics and the basic strokes inside our introduction point that this application

102
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.780
is going to use graphics in extensive manner.

103
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.830
So what actually these graphics are doing.

104
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:22.390
So we have to first import this graphics from the JWT library and graphics 2D as we are going to draw

105
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.860
to the images inside this canvas.

106
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:33.050
So this application is providing a wide space canvas basically, and they are with the help of these

107
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:40.580
components of this library, we are going to decide that what kind of graphics we are going to draw.

108
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:49.190
So we are like declaring them a rectangle, a circle and a line or naming it as DMP one MP 20 MP three

109
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:56.890
So whenever we want to draw that specific shape, we will be using these names to access these shapes.

110
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.900
So how this graphics things is working.

111
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.630
So suppose we are using a for low.

112
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:09.560
We are starting this for loop from zero to the size of the shape and it is going to be incremented one

113
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:09.950
by one.

114
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.580
So how this final statement is working.

115
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:19.130
So suppose we want to draw a rectangle and set a colour for that rectangle.

116
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:25.940
So firstly, this is going to access that rectangle from this that yes, we want to draw a rectangle

117
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:26.390
here.

118
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.430
The button will show draw a rectangle.

119
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:35.480
Once we hit on this button, then this will call the image we have imported the image of the rectangle,

120
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.110
of course.

121
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.710
So how the rectangle should look, which will decide.

122
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:47.060
So this class will decide that we want a graphic of a rectangle, and we have already an image for that

123
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.840
rectangle.

124
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:56.360
You simply call that image inside our white space, inside our canvas, and set the size accordingly

125
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.970
for that rectangle and of course the colour.

126
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.840
So this is how things are going to be put together.

127
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.640
We are creating a rectangle.

128
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.810
Similarly, if we are choosing a circle, then check the colour for like what do you want the colour

129
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.950
of the oval to be?

130
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.400
And yes, its distance from the x axis.

131
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.160
Y axis is its width and height of course.

132
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.940
So this is how this graphic thing is working.

133
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:31.670
This is going to get that specific shape from this image class and then put it inside the canvas.

134
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.050
Okay.

135
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:40.620
So this was all about the graphics theory inside this paint canvas tool interface application.

136
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:48.810
We are simply putting up the graphics of the rectangle, the circle and the line, and feeling colors

137
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.520
to it, setting the size to it.

138
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:59.310
Now we were discussing about the motion of the mouse, so how this mouse motion listener thing works

139
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.000
actually.

140
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.570
So we have imported the mouse motion is not from the event library.

141
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:10.530
So this is going to listen to the event which our mouse is going to like perform.

142
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.210
So on a mouse click, a specific thing is going to be performed.

143
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:21.360
So suppose we click a mouse so that a shape should be drawn to the screen.

144
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:28.980
And yes, this repaint to what we have already discussed that this repaint will help us to erase and

145
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.670
redraw.

146
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.910
That means in a minimum interval of time.

147
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.880
So once we click the mouse, then that image will be drawn to our canvas.

148
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:46.650
Now suppose we pressed mouse, so we want to drag something to a specific position.

149
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.930
If it is a line, then the line will be drawn from a starting point to the ending point.

150
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:58.200
And if we want to like press on a rectangle and drag it to any other position, then it is going to

151
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.280
change its coordinates accordingly on the x axis and devices.

152
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:08.490
So this press is going to set the position from the x axis and y axis respectively.

153
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:15.570
Now, when once the mouse is released, then the updated updated position is the six x and set y is

154
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:21.150
going to be the updated coordinates of that specific shape which is being drawn.

155
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.530
And yes, we have created a function for mouse.

156
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.250
Enter mouse.

157
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.900
Currently we are not using it, but in future if we want to implement something features for mouse,

158
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.300
center and mouse, then we can add it.

159
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.270
Now how this removal function is working.

160
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:46.860
So this remove all function is going to simply clear all like clear everything on the canvas.

161
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:53.370
This button is also playing an important role inside this canvas as it is going to erase everything

162
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.610
which is being drawn on this and what this is doing.

163
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.520
So this is going to remove shapes one by one.

164
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:01.070
Okay.

165
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.350
And how much are is working.

166
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.260
So we are dragging our mouse.

167
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:13.460
Yes, we are pressing it to a position and is the final position where it is being released.

168
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.510
But in between there is a process of dragging the mouse.

169
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:25.370
So when we are dragging the mouse, the coordinates are being updated continuously and when it is released,

170
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:33.380
then that coordinate will be like captured and fixed as the current coordinate for that specific issue.

171
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:41.210
So this is how this drawing area function was working, like how inside this drawing area class we were

172
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:48.500
putting shapes or adding functionalities to the mouse that how the mouse is going to work inside this

173
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.460
application.

174
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:57.920
Now let us try to run this application and check the functionalities that whether we have put things

175
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.660
correctly inside the programming section and whether they are working like correctly or not.

176
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.500
So let us check it by running the application.

177
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:07.580
Okay.

178
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:14.840
So coming to the main class drawing editor Java and try to run java, let's see that the application

179
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.350
is open.

180
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:15.830
Okay.

181
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.630
So perfect it is open.

182
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.900
The resize button is working perfectly fine.

183
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.020
Or there is a title panel.

184
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.660
There are two panels, the top panel and the sidebar.

185
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.000
And let us try to draw something.

186
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:38.060
So suppose we are setting 150 and 200 at the height and the word and suppose a color.

187
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.230
We want to choose yellow and a full rectangle.

188
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.410
We want to draw so perfect the rectangle is drawn.

189
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.600
Now check it for the oval.

190
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:54.800
So again, setting 150 and 200 and a color to the oval.

191
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:55.120
Okay.

192
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:59.140
Suppose it is this time red color and a full oval.

193
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.170
So on hitting it, we have successfully drawn oval.

194
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.240
We can like use the mouse motionless, nothing correctly.

195
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.240
We can change the position of the shape.

196
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.470
Now let us check the line thing so you can see the top bar is different.

197
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:21.170
In the case of nine, we we have been discussing about that so long.

198
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.500
So suppose 90 and a color blue.

199
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.340
So we have to draw a drag the mouse.

200
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.780
So suppose you have dragged it this.

201
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.800
So we will.

202
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.430
Yes.

203
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.410
The line is moving, of course.

204
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.210
A new line.

205
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.300
And again.

206
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.610
Annoyingly.

207
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.320
So the lion part is also working perfectly fine.

208
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.860
Now let's try to remove this line one by one.

209
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.490
Okay.

210
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.290
So this is done.

211
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:54.100
Now let us set this trash button is working correctly or not.

212
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.130
So anything it everything is cleared from the frame.

213
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:03.010
So, yes, we have completed the programming execution of this application.

214
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.260
Everything is working perfectly fine.

215
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.740
Only one thing which is remain left to check.

216
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.350
Let us try to save this image.

217
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.220
So on hitting the save button, the file chooser opens up.

218
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:24.580
Now let's try to save this image inside our local disk d call it test and hit don't save.

219
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.880
So the image has been saved successfully.

220
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.740
Method is being shown up.

221
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.870
Now let us check that whether it is being saved or not.

222
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.430
Okay, so we have saved our test the jpg inside our system.

223
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.960
So overall this application, we have checked everything.

224
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.480
The application is working perfectly fine.

225
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.170
The coding part is completely functional in all the manners.

226
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:54.100
And yes, I would encourage you all to try this at your own, make this application, try applying the

227
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.450
concepts of Java that how this print application is going to work.

228
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.890
And I want to thank you all for attending this session, this project.

229
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.670
Thank you.
