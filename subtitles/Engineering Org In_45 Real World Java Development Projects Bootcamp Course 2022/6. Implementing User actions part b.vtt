00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.780
Previous video, we have seen the election law aftermath.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.980
We have to learn our file and see what will happen where we go.

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.700
Right.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.310
Right.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.860
Okay.

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.410
So this one is not running, but this is the green.

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.860
Green.

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.550
Okay, so we will see what has gone wrong.

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.120
So we will go to the.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.250
Okay.

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.320
So component.

12
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.580
Two, two, three.

13
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.060
Okay.

14
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.760
One, two, three.

15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.060
Change this corner.

16
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.530
Too much into this color.

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.100
Do?

18
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.730
No.

19
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.880
Orange.

20
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.380
Now.

21
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.240
Save this file and run this.

22
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.630
Yeah.

23
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.650
Blockchain is working here.

24
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:22.940
Know what we have to do is we need a counter, or at least we have to take our counter.

25
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.930
Also name it as encounter and initialize it to the zero.

26
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.390
Who do

27
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.770
we have to know?

28
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.800
So we have to imagine.

29
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.010
Okay, now what do we have to do here?

30
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.370
We need a display image.

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.150
Display image.

32
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.070
And here we will set it to the.

33
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.160
Choose or don't

34
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.800
get an x and this one will be the one.

35
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.550
Here said this to the neighbor, this little thing.

36
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.290
Chewing gum x is not public and component cannot be accessed from outside package.

37
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.620
So go to the expert.

38
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.670
Okay.

39
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.780
I think.

40
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.960
Keen to look older, run the images.

41
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.510
No.

42
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.400
Who do we have to write?

43
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.340
Display.

44
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.580
Meech

45
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.290
simply sent it images or both.

46
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.420
Okay.

47
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.000
Put the counter.

48
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.590
And another one.

49
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.040
Okay.

50
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.300
Here should.

51
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.410
This one is the jeep.

52
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.570
So here it should be the one.

53
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.610
Here should be the zero.

54
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.850
And send it to me.

55
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.080
Simply from another file.

56
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.470
Union Getty Images.

57
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.360
But it's not in the random, right?

58
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.940
The election is working and our images aren't displaying.

59
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.360
So what could be the next step to randomize these pics?

60
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.650
So what should we do?

61
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.190
No steps to random images.

62
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.290
So here's the counter.

63
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.720
So here is the counter one.

64
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.610
And here we will do one thing.

65
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.940
We will call the plus plus and one semicolon.

66
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:48.380
And okay, this is going to identify our expected what should be done to identify expected.

67
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.110
Got this.

68
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.720
Put it here.

69
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.250
Okay.

70
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.490
Sudan.

71
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.050
See this thing.

72
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.530
To put this

73
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.900
simply, we have to check this thing.

74
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.960
Also, run our file.

75
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.460
Showing the relative.

76
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.160
At a moment of exception and extradited from Scotland six.

77
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.180
So we have to fix this exception here.

78
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.410
What have we done wrong here?

79
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.580
Look, the component to.

80
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:56.020
Mickey simply called the sculptor here and this one to here.

81
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.790
What should we do next?

82
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.160
We have to make that counter variable inside this body.

83
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.530
Plus.

84
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.440
Plus, I don't know.

85
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.330
Run over five.

86
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.180
We will see.

87
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.820
Okay.

88
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.380
So it's working.

89
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.230
Yep.

90
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.540
I'm keen.

91
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.920
There is an error in xx146.

92
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.320
Okay.

93
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.860
So we have to fix that thing again.

94
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.230
What?

95
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.620
And due to one.

96
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.710
What can we do next thing?

97
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.630
Can you see doing that out of the index.

98
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.080
Out of.

99
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.100
All right.

100
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.350
So what could we do next?

101
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.400
To fix that error.

102
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.150
The complain to this.

103
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.430
Okay.

104
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.930
So here.

105
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.670
Right.

106
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.390
The thing we need.

107
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.290
She lived here.

108
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.940
No.

109
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.120
We need that chili.

110
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.830
So we need a.

111
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.810
Really, really cool to

112
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:21.130
leave that component to under that control.

113
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.420
Right.

114
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.260
A lot set.

115
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:34.910
And they pulled in, give the ruling to the folks here.

116
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:49.590
And so what we have done, we have disabled children.

117
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.180
It's done?

118
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:54.950
No.

119
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.700
Okay.

120
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.630
Well, the same thing we have to do here again.

121
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:01.820
Here.

122
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.030
We have to write.

123
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.630
No.

124
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.860
I think what you need to do.

125
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.530
So none.

126
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:34.030
Here should be the component for me piece.

127
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.280
This should be.

128
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.340
No I think component to.

129
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.740
Yeah.

130
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.830
Component one.

131
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.560
And we need a condition here.

132
00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:02.100
What could be the condition if Nepal not is enabled?

133
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.920
So we simply write.

134
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.740
Can't this.

135
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.740
But inside this.

136
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:30.160
So this will check the condition here.

137
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.680
Done.

138
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.680
So this thing is done.

139
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.400
And the same thing is goes with this part also.

140
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.770
Right.

141
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.860
We have tried this.

142
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.670
Labor is enabled.

143
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.780
The smart.

144
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.340
So.

145
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.850
You disagree?

146
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.700
Okay.

147
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.260
Here on this thing is done.

148
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.750
I'll simply run our program here.

149
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.830
Check this pain.

150
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.570
Yeah.

151
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.260
We are getting it right here.

152
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:49.910
Yes.

153
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.430
So it's working?

154
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.600
Yes.

155
00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:01.300
So the next thing, what we have to do here, we have disabled people.

156
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.380
Now, the thing which we have to do is who?

157
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.500
The food that.

158
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.740
You know, often.

159
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.740
So often they kill.

160
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.160
So here we will try to label.

161
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.610
Is unable.

162
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.490
And you have already said the name will false.

163
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.710
So we could hear false?

164
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.920
None.

165
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.460
No.

166
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.170
Just sorry.

167
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.300
They never seem.

168
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.460
Need not.

169
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.850
Set a world.

170
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.610
I put it to the phones here and done here.

171
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.080
No simply running our program.

172
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:16.850
Okay.

173
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.840
So it's working.

174
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:23.860
Yeah.
