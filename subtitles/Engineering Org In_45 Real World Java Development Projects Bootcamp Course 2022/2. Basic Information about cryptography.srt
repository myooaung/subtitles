1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,790
So in the first part I discussed about cryptography and different techniques.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,300
So let us keep it aside.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,470
I can say cryptography that is more focus on why we are using Java.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:28,270
So again, I'm focusing on Gvm and JDK instead of if you know, there are not very like research languages

5
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:34,840
like Python also create virtual environment, but Gvm is virtual machine so we can perform different

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,450
cryptography techniques on each and we can check that part.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,030
But JVM is basically Java virtual machine.

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,380
It's not physically exist.

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,200
Java is made up of different parts.

10
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,280
JVM, Guardian, JDK, JDK is basically Java development kit.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:56,080
It consists of Jad and JVM physically exist is the implementation of JVM its runtime environment.

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:02,800
There are different libraries, Java files, there are different programs in that, but JVM never existed

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,660
on your system.

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,220
It is just a virtual environment or virtual machine which loads calls, verifies calls, executes calls

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,760
on its own.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,960
So that's a very powerful thing in Java, like there is a virtual machine, so we never required about

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,480
trades and those parts.

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,440
Our system configuration never limits Java programs.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,060
So that's very important.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,250
Then this is basic thing, JDK, Java structure, this is my JVM, if I consider it like this.

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:42,610
So in this and so this is basically Venn diagram you can like so just like this journey and we are gvm

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,090
here and there are sets of libraries and different things here.

23
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,400
So now let me tell you, what is the cryptography thing?

24
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,050
Yes.

25
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,760
Okay.

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,140
So before going to.

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,230
For their part, let me tell some.

28
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,640
Right.

29
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,760
Cryptography.

30
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,650
And what is the cryptography in the market?

31
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,420
You can.

32
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,010
There are different things like bitcoin is like that's cryptocurrency.

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,020
If you know, the U.S. thinks Bitcoin also, there are Dogecoin also.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,550
That's a cryptocurrency.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,570
So crypto is not about money currency.

36
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:30,380
Cryptography is just basically the technique to hide the text so high the plaintext.

37
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:38,990
So let me, as I told you, a B is doing the stuffs, sending the data to the outside world.

38
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,570
There are a lot of lot of tricks available.

39
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,280
These articles are.

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,390
These are my attackers which always want to penetrate to this system or these systems or any data.

41
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
They want to steal these information always.

42
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,000
But and we are very talented.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,010
Or we can say intelligent persons.

44
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,800
They are talking in code language also.

45
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,000
Always.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,620
They are talking in code language.

47
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,330
Or always, which No.

48
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,300
Four known that code language is known for a and so that's a similar thing in cryptography.

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,660
But.

50
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,200
What is great is sending this message.

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,640
So this is my message.

52
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,770
With some key.

53
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,190
With some key.

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:33,820
So this is circle is my just key sending to this being knows this is the key to encrypt the data b is

55
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:41,440
also having this data or we can say key to encrypt that my this part this is the my data.

56
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,580
This is my key.

57
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,200
But.

58
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,480
No one knows this is the key because there is no meaning for that key.

59
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,220
There is no meaning for that data.

60
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,860
So that's the encryption thing is happening here.

61
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,010
So now A and B charts are safe.

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,230
So in previous part I told you what is the basic things?

63
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:09,810
Like what is the semantic semantic use basically for the encryption and the decryption?

64
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:17,150
These saying these same for the encryption and decryption.

65
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,250
So I will tell you what is the inscription?

66
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,680
Inscription is this basically plaintext ciphertext?

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,440
Ciphertext is basically no one can read that message.

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,700
There is no meaning for that.

69
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,430
We can read that message, but there is no meaning for that text.

70
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,590
There are some symbols.

71
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,360
Also, we can include some streaks, anything, data in that we can add space.

72
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,620
So that's a thing for the decryption and encryption.

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,580
If key is same, then it's known as symmetric key.

74
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,470
Then what is the asymmetric?

75
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,830
If there is a symmetric thing, there should be symmetric thing.

76
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,440
What is the ultimate thing?

77
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:51,860
Why?

78
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,330
Sending a data to be a creates two keys.

79
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,400
One is public.

80
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,370
Another one is private.

81
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,100
For the encryption of data when it's public and other is private to send the data.

82
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,740
So what a is doing.

83
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,380
He's doing all he's encrypting the data using.

84
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,660
Encrypting the data using this public key.

85
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,100
Okay.

86
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,830
Encrypting data with this public key.

87
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,540
This is my public key.

88
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,920
And sending this key would be also to decrypt that data.

89
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,930
But why be sending some data to a.

90
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,430
It is decrypting that data to his private.

91
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,590
So as you can say that there is a lot of lot of security in this and there are different techniques

92
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,270
like signature in hashing.

93
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,530
Different things happen here or in this data.

94
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,490
So let me move to some important part.

95
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,060
So what is the cryptography thing here?

96
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,960
Let me tell you.

97
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,600
Cryptography is a study of different techniques to secure data from unauthorized entry.

98
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,800
So cryptography is not always related to encryption on anything.

99
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,800
It's a technique to secure data from unauthorized entity.

100
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:29,110
And anything you want to say in computer science, we try to develop strategies and practices to protecting

101
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,120
sensitive data.

102
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:39,780
Now, if you have checked WhatsApp, all they are saying end to end encrypted that what it means your

103
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,870
chatting is not stored as a common text or your voice is not stored as a common text.

104
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,020
It's encrypted.

105
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:53,230
So most of cryptography involves very advanced mathematical functions used to or used for securing data.

106
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,490
Why?

107
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,930
We request advanced things?

108
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,860
Because attackers are always changing their strategies.

109
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,630
They are always trying to penetrate the system.

110
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,020
So we require a very advanced functions, mathematical functions for these purposes.

111
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,080
The sole purpose of algorithms to develop cryptography is hide data from attacker or middlemen.

112
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,770
In this article we are going to understood this part and everything.

113
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,410
So you may take the cryptography things and we are going to do that stuff.

114
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,960
So this is the plaintext.

115
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,520
I played one key.

116
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,900
Which encryption algorithm.

117
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,570
Ciphertext generated decryption algorithm only pin test is generated.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,080
So what is this imp things I'm going to tell you.

119
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,840
plainText is basically your original message or data that is hidden from view through of cryptography

120
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,580
or encryption algorithm.

121
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,970
Ciphertext is basically your output of encryption, which is not readable, like in previous thing I

122
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,330
created.

123
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,300
DB That's the ciphertext key is a piece of data or collected pair of data.

124
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,580
Well input with plain text.

125
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,260
Encryption of ciphertext is basically just encrypting and decrypting the data.

126
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:13,320
If you put in that part, you will get or you will understand the plaintext for that purposes.

127
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,240
And so it is a random piece of data which is added to the hashing function.

128
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,530
So I will tell you what is the hash here?

129
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:29,020
Hash is nothing, but you have to create some map of arbitrary size of data or bytes in that data,

130
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:37,210
in that main data to create some mathematical functions or create some mathematical attributes for that

131
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:37,960
purposes.

132
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:47,050
So there are different encryption algorithms to pull these RSA inside of encryption standards to Phish

133
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:57,940
Blowfish idea MD for you Mac Sha 256 is most like hashing functions of 256 bits bitcoin is using SHA

134
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,080
256 is very higher level algorithms also they are using.

135
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,150
So these are the purposes of a and asymmetric encryption.

136
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,740
As I told you, public private key was created and they are shared to this.

137
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:17,080
So mostly the cryptocurrencies are using all symmetric, but for the simpler purposes I'm deploying

138
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,860
the simple NIR, which is basically no.

139
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,490
Well semantically.

140
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,380
So now.

141
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:38,870
Let us create two or three things here which are very useful and let us see how we can set up our project.

142
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,260
So for the project setup, it's very easy.

143
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,440
You can you have to go to your ID.

144
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,220
And choose your own.

145
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,960
You can choose anything.

146
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,470
I'm not forcing anyone to stick to only one ID.

147
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,910
There is a reason for that because that's not really everyone's part.

148
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,920
Then I'm going with In Danger Area.

149
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,600
If you want to proceed with this, you may proceed with this.

150
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,310
So open your own eyes.

151
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,180
It will take some time to open.

152
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,890
But meanwhile, let me refresh your things.

153
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:30,830
plainText is basically just original message or data which is hidden due to from cryptographic encryption

154
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,530
algorithms then.

155
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,510
There is one.

156
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,970
Another thing is ciphertext, which is input and output of encryption.

157
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:51,020
And GHI is a piece of data and salt is another piece of data which is added to the hashing function.

158
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:58,370
And I will tell you what is the hashing later because it will not understand directly using this part.

159
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,590
We have to check for different purposes there.

160
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,500
So you need to create a new project in your own ID.

161
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,530
So what I'm going to do is.

162
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:41,250
I'm going to create my new project in my ID, so let me open my ID sometimes take two 3 minutes to to

163
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,790
my system configuration.

164
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,560
Meanwhile, let us see what is Java class.

165
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:03,230
And so everything in Java is associated with classes and objects along with attributes and thoughts.

166
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:09,760
Considering the real life example, car is an object which has some attributes such as weight, colours,

167
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,500
etc. etc. but

168
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,950
God is also having a constructor or blueprint of creating objects in class.

169
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,420
All does some user defined attributes to pass values or inputs.

170
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,230
Objects are used to create classes which are already created and invoke.

171
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,930
So that's it about how we are going to this and these some information about Java classes.

172
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,990
So class is a blueprint for object, as I told you already.

173
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,080
And class is something to store different functions methods in one block of code and this is the syntax

174
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,490
for reclaiming the classes.

175
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,330
So in the next part and how we can deploy it and how we can run our code in the next part.

176
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,600
Hope you understand.

177
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,230
Thank you.
