00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.820
Now here we need some g panel component.

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.020
We will take the component.

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.650
Scratch bracket limited scope one and.

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.150
Right the component

5
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.890
practically limit to.

6
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.600
Number one, we need a string.

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.590
Random image.

8
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:49.710
Here are Chili Bowl beat Liverpool three on Liverpool's.

9
00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:03.770
Stream a 2D animate as images ponder and simply write the new.

10
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.500
Trying.

11
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.750
Simply the square bracket.

12
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.980
So.

13
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.300
Com these.

14
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.220
One, two, three, four, five, six.

15
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.150
And there are the six who put the six here and.

16
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.330
Into another one we will write that to.

17
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.430
Okay.

18
00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:04.630
From the first look at the sun sets and these rules are so science this 6 to 8 component and this is

19
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.290
done not this.

20
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.350
We have to go we have to create another ArrayList here.

21
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:27.520
So we need an added list of string, some string and write list equal to

22
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.950
new ArrayList.

23
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.970
Add

24
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.260
parentheses don't.

25
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.890
Here we have our edit list and we need one thing more.

26
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.230
Here we have to create random random equal to new.

27
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:03.270
I know on the air the Sunnis don't know what we have to do.

28
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.470
You know, we will go.

29
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.380
Look, we have set our borders here.

30
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.720
Not only have to do one more thing, which is we have to add labels.

31
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.340
So no names.

32
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:39.940
Abel So we will write labels equal to new chain label.

33
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.520
Julie.

34
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.630
Ari.

35
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.100
And here, do nothing on clothes, Claire.

36
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.040
Hmm.

37
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.520
Do not close, Claire.

38
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.430
Right.

39
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.850
And.

40
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.440
Do we need to write?

41
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.200
I think we need a balance as it girly bracket.

42
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.780
And under this you need another curly bracket here.

43
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.310
And then this we will right?

44
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.440
Firstly see this.

45
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.450
These labels are named as here.

46
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:41.140
This label is name as G, label one underscore two and similar to that good score to underscore, to

47
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.250
underscore, to underscore, to find the score two and five, six underscore two.

48
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.970
So this is the second row.

49
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.980
This one is the first row here.

50
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:59.770
So these g labels are named as Jellyroll one underscore one, two underscore one, three underscore

51
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.910
one and the four underscore one, five and Driscoll one 600.

52
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.600
So I already mean these labels.

53
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.990
So now we need this name.

54
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.190
So here we will write.

55
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.920
We will try to.

56
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.240
Any one, one, one comma.

57
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.950
G LeBron, you need one one.

58
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.450
This one.

59
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.710
And after this comma, curly bracket, open close label.

60
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.690
And here we need.

61
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.840
Two one.

62
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.880
Como

63
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.870
Chile, Boone?

64
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.540
The and chili bowl.

65
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.630
And here we need to underscore to.

66
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.740
Coma.

67
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.960
P.

68
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.790
Look, you need another name as Chili Boone.

69
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.050
Three.

70
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.280
Cuomo Three new schools, one and another one.

71
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:42.310
July three new do to another curly bracket here and this we will write g label for new score one comma

72
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.330
j label for a new school to.

73
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.580
Goma.

74
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.720
This, Julie.

75
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.180
I scored one chili bowl.

76
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.910
I went to school to go.

77
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.480
McCurley Brackett opened back close

78
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.550
to 600 schools.

79
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.080
One former Juniper six underscore two.

80
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.080
Don't.

81
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.930
You put the semicolon.

82
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.940
Hockey.
