1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,850
A board is cleared and initialized with the following piece.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,470
Right.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:12,000
But we have to create a timer, and the timer is executed at the period interval which we have created

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the variable.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,770
So what we have to do, we will hear, look and.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,980
Right.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,640
I might call the new timer.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,540
Sorry the new timer and do this we will write period.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,950
Interval comma, new games.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,640
We will create this one.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,850
Also, we have game cycle and then none and then timer.

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,650
Don't start again.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,690
Okay?

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,460
This thing is done here.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,160
What we have.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,380
Create a timer.

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:02,720
The timer is executed at period interval beta interval intervals and creating a new game cycle.

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,390
And what we have done here, we have this is the pause method.

19
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,700
This pauses or resumes the game.

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,310
When the game is paused, we display the paused message here in the status bar.

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,700
And now we will do one more thing.

22
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,300
We will create another matter with the drawing method.

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,600
But before that we will do one more thing.

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,150
We need the paint component.

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,950
So we will write.

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,850
We will overwrite.

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,070
Sorry, public void.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,030
Being the component.

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,720
Mhm.

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:52,160
And component and into this we have to do graphics G and under this some graphics we need this graphics

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,640
and under this we will call the super dot print component.

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:10,040
This one set it to the G and we will create that matter which is named as the do drawing and give the

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,690
parameter to the G.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,580
So this is done and we will create this matter and we have to write the body of this as well.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,490
So inside the two drawing matter, we draw all the objects on the board.

36
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,970
The painting has two steps here.

37
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,230
What we will do.

38
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,250
We will do one thing.

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,460
Firstly, take variable size.

40
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:48,250
So set the variable size equal to get size and the get size method which we will create a mean class

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,180
press.

42
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:55,420
So here we will the two steps which will be here.

43
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:06,940
Just see that we will write in more top and right size.

44
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:21,790
Don't get to I think height and width are board height minus and then multiplied by square table.

45
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,890
It's like square height, which we have created this.

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,390
MARTIN okay.

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,890
It has to.

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,080
We have done the typecasting as well to the end and now what we have to do.

49
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,040
This will be our first step.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:58,130
So we will create our for loop and write for int i equal to zero semicolon i.e. less than two board.

51
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,620
We need the board.

52
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,220
Right.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,840
Okay.

54
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,210
I think.

55
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,860
Sorry.

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:16,830
Okay.

57
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,930
So I is less than two board height.

58
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,330
Here the board height and.

59
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,060
And we will do okay.

60
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,450
We will do the post increment here, not the pre.

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:45,850
So under this or loop we will create another for loop with the variable g in the j equal to zero and

62
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:57,390
one j is less than to the board of it here and now post to increment of the g variable.

63
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,190
The system under this for loop we will create.

64
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:21,000
Firstly, we write that terminal C equal to the Shepard method and here we will write the G variable.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,700
And here what we need would.

66
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,530
Bora Bora it minus a, minus one.

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,100
And now, after this, we need some conditions.

68
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,340
So we will write if she.

69
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,250
They're not equal to.

70
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,620
They do not know -- and we have no shape.

71
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,380
Then do one more thing.

72
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,300
Draw near the draw.

73
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:14,510
We will create a smarter in our class and get the parameter g command g.

74
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,180
We need the square work here.

75
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,870
So what we will call the square root.

76
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,860
And then.

77
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:37,860
We have to do one thing as well, comma and write board to do the plus.

78
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,090
I multiplied to the square height?

79
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,030
Yeah.

80
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,280
No.

81
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,170
Yeah.

82
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,080
I think we have to multiply with them square height.

83
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,720
And this is drawn by another parameter.

84
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,400
We'll go with the shape.

85
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,810
And this is a I think I have done it wrong.

86
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,110
It should be width, not the height.

87
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,090
Set it to the word.

88
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:16,410
This has to be so we have to do one more condition and check it to the if

89
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,780
called the Kirby store, that ship.

90
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,310
It is not equal to no ship.

91
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,330
Right.

92
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,260
That terminal, not no ship.

93
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,510
And then we have to do.

94
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,340
The acting and what we have done, we will do in the first step.

95
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:51,320
We paint all the shapes or the remains of the sheep that have been dropped at the bottom of the board

96
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,410
on the squares.

97
00:07:52,410 --> 00:08:01,380
And remember, in the border we accesses, we access that it using the shape and method here this one.

98
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,220
So we we do another one more thing.

99
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,500
This will be our next second step.

100
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,150
So here what we will do.

101
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,500
We need four in equal to zero.

102
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:29,690
Then I listed for done I do the post increment and here then here we will write in x equal to.

103
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,470
And I think in the second step we paint the actual falling piece, right?

104
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,990
So what we will do in x equal will call the x variable.

105
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,580
The x is the current piece.

106
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,860
Here we have the current piece and the current tax return.

107
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:03,690
I thought x and provide it to the OC and similar to that we write in y equal to.

108
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:24,550
In my current FY plus current peace same thing no current peace and provider not to why I and this is

109
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,060
done.

110
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,670
We pay natural following peace, so we will do so.

111
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,740
We need to draw square.

112
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,170
Esquire.

113
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,240
We're right here.

114
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,740
G Gomer.

115
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,880
Thanks, God.

116
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:08,860
Scratch beneath the fruit and go with the comma and ride board.

117
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,380
Don't do with the board.

118
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,540
We need a board height.

119
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,070
Right.

120
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:24,040
So we will ride board height minus y and we will do one more thing, the minus one.

121
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,410
And here this is done.

122
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,940
It should be multiplied with the square height.

123
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,290
This one.

124
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:42,890
And after this, we need the current peace and not access to the get -- done.

125
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,310
And this thing is done.

126
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,520
So what do we have to do now?

127
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,970
We have to do x is one more thing, the drop down method.

128
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:03,620
So we will set it to the drop down so we have what we have done.

129
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,460
This will be the first step.

130
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,700
We paint all the ships or remains of the ship that have been dropped at the bottom of the boat port

131
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,920
on the square side.

132
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,160
Remember, in the board.

133
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,400
We exit you using the shape add method and this will be our second step.

134
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,090
We paint the actual falling piece here.

135
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,370
So we need another method and this will be called as the drop down.

136
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,990
So after this, we will create our dropdown method.

137
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:42,350
We will write private void, name it as drop down and curly bracket.

138
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,930
Done.

139
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:52,520
Here we will create a new y and set it to the current VI this time.

140
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,330
So if we press the space key, the pieces drop to the bottom.

141
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:04,280
We simply try to drop the piece one line down until it reaches the bottom or the top of another foreign

142
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,460
Tetris piece when the Tetris piece finishes folding the piece.

143
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,100
I think we will create another matter and name it to not be drowned.

144
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,600
And it is called there.

145
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:28,670
So what we will do, we have to take the while loop and simply set it to the new y is greater than zero

146
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,740
and not this while loop.

147
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,390
We will provide some conditions and we write if it is not.

148
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:54,930
We will create this matter after, say, two current peace men comma, current x, comma, new y minus

149
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,500
one.

150
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,700
Here, this one.

151
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,330
And it's done.

152
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,820
And what do we have to do?

153
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,520
We have to write.

154
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,270
Break.

155
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,380
And after this, we have to decrease.

156
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,470
Who knew?

157
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,400
I touch my nose and it's done.

158
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,320
And we have to call that matter.

159
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,610
Okay, so we press the space key, the pieces drop to the bottom.

160
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:27,330
We simply try to drop the piece one line down until it reaches that bottom or top of the another fallen

161
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,380
Tetris piece.

162
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,520
So when the Tetris piece finishes falling, the piece drop, which we will create here.
