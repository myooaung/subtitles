1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:10,080
So by far we have covering the contents inside the frame like we have been creating the contents of

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,890
the frame by initializing the frame after which the settings panel inside the frame.

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,800
Like attaching to it.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,420
We have set a background color to the panel.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,090
Like initially we have created three panels.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,990
We can take a look like this is the panel one.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,660
This is the first panel now this is the second where it is.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,550
So we have three panels.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,380
This is third panel and above it we have the second panel.

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:53,100
So in total we have three panels till now and like buttons attached to all of all three of them.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,310
And all the three, four buttons are functional.

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,990
Like we have action listener attached to that button and some event is going to be performed after clicking

13
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,910
on that specific button.

14
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:14,010
So now let us take a look at the window of running the programme and check whether everything is working

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,400
fine till now or there are any exceptions.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,580
So let and let us take a look at the function.

17
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,170
So getting to this and try running Java and waiting for the programme to execute.

18
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:37,020
So yes, we have our frame, we can maximise it, minimise it, as I already told you, that the frame

19
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,960
is like resizable so we can resize it and it will adjust accordingly.

20
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,880
So yes.

21
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,830
So we have three panels, we already talked about it like the three panels have a button attached to

22
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,400
them.

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,050
This is between one, this is between two and this is between three.

24
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:08,550
And if we click like by default, that equal signal case keyboard was responsible for starting the game

25
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,280
with the X character initially.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:21,510
So if I click here, I am getting an x symbol with a red colour and font size, then a font width and

27
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,470
a specific font style which we have set in the programme.

28
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,280
So the first button is working perfectly fine.

29
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,220
Now, taking a look at the second one.

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:40,980
So after the is chance, the chance transforms automatically to or in the next button.

31
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,380
And similarly for the third button, the chance is transferred to X.

32
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:54,900
So till now three panels are created, three buttons are created and action listeners are attached to

33
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,970
those buttons respectively.

34
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,720
But what is going to happen after the click of the buttons?

35
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,370
Like one by one?

36
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,690
We have covered all the panels and the buttons are looking at that here.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,480
We have already set the font style, the font board, like the weight of the font and everything.

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:28,650
So in total we have like 15 buttons in the like frame, so we have to set total 15 panels and a button

39
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,580
attached to them.

40
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,690
And then actually it's not attached to that button respectively.

41
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:41,460
Now that after completing the three panels successfully getting into the fourth panel configuration

42
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:49,740
and this is responsible for creating like a new panel and we have some dimensions to the panel, some

43
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:58,260
colours on that panel is added to the frame, of course, for the functioning and panel for layout is

44
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,950
set to zero zero initially jailable.

45
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,060
And the fourth panel is what actually doing.

46
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:17,070
So the panel is responsible for like handling a label which is going to contain the score of the player.

47
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,570
So we have two panels for the score thing.

48
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,690
This is like a name of the player and this is for the score.

49
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:34,110
Updation So in this we are covering the name part like on running this, you will be get a clear idea

50
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,870
about what I am actually talking about.

51
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,210
So waiting for the execution.

52
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,180
So yes, this panel is created.

53
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,150
This is the panel we created right now.

54
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,530
And this player is containing a text called Player X.

55
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:58,860
And this is going to be this thing and this is going to look like we in our row and handling the score

56
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,400
of.

57
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,800
So we are done with this now.

58
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,460
We will close this and try to like add a similar thing for player also.

59
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,730
Afterwards, we will like the score updation block also for both of the players.

60
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:28,050
So you may be wondering that why I said this fifth panel, two X count set columns like this is going

61
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:37,200
to count the score of the Player X and I am setting it to the 10th column in the row as we have nine

62
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,930
grid layout columns reserved for the chances to be played by both the players.

63
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:52,310
So this is going to be placed like this here after the nine blocks so that this player playing like

64
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,420
window will not get affected by the score thing.

65
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,550
This is a separate thing like this nine and this six are separate thing.

66
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,850
They are outside the game window.

67
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,870
They are not going to be changed by the players anyway after this.

68
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,680
Like similarly adding we have like successfully added panels.

69
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:28,440
Now after this we are going to like taking into consideration that how the chances of the players are

70
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,210
shifting after each play play chance.

71
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:46,560
So for this we will be going to initialize a button calling it button four and new button for that,

72
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
of course.

73
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:58,610
Initially the button is going to contain empty strings and inside this we are going to like add actual

74
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,590
listeners.

75
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:08,150
So the button four is going to consist action listener and we are going to add action listener to the

76
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,780
button.

77
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:17,360
We are going to choose it from the suggestions of course, and new action listener is going to be placed.

78
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,280
So action is not.

79
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,030
Listener.

80
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:34,330
Yes, so we have actually a listener for the weekend for and after which we are going to like create

81
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,220
a function.

82
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,600
Initialize a function of course.

83
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,620
Now this is something.

84
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,190
We have placed this at the wrong place, I think.

85
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,960
Yes.

86
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,730
So there was a bracket.

87
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,420
Missing.

88
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,840
We have to place this here now again, creating the same button.

89
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:03,550
And yes, this is the actual listener added to the beeping for and what actually it is doing.

90
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:13,000
So this public void action performed function which contains action event energy zero as the argument

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,820
and the action attached to the event like we are calling the button says event and what event is going

92
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,010
to be performed on clicking the button?

93
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,530
So the game is set to start game in the initial stage.

94
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:37,750
Like by default, the game is going to start without like escaping or closing when we will hit the close

95
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,600
button like it will be closed after that only.

96
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:49,930
So inside this if statement we have initially like already set the first play as x and the button colour

97
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,220
is set to red.

98
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,660
Yes.

99
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,720
So before is set to one initially.

100
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:02,490
So suppose that the first chance is played at the fourth, like let me show you.

101
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,010
Yes.

102
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,960
So this is the fourth column, fourth button V, whatever we call it.

103
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:18,130
So when X is going to play its chance here, so we are setting a colour to the font and we are implementing

104
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:26,890
the I like the next spread is going to play that chance after that that only so before it is going to

105
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,660
be placed here and after it the chance is going to be played here.

106
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,660
Not this place is incremented.

107
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,170
So we have already set conditions for return one.

108
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,730
We tend to be two and three.

109
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:48,840
Now we are done with B10 four and I is incremented so we have total of nine eyes like I is from 1 to

110
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,430
9 and already we are like implementing four.

111
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,420
I took four.

112
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:02,560
Now if as like suppose this zero is playing the chance at before, suppose zero is playing its chances

113
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,220
before.

114
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:11,530
So that color that will be reflected to the text is blue and b four will reflect zero like before will

115
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,300
be storing zero at its place like similar this similar to this.

116
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,160
Yes and choose player winning game is called after this like this.

117
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:32,170
What are the minimum care like chances to be played to make a specific player wins so minimum four chances

118
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:32,890
are to be played.

119
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:41,920
Suppose X platelets chance and zero predicts chance in the second chance and after which explanation.

120
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,560
Now the next chance is transferred to zero.

121
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,870
So we have already covered like four blocks, two of a specific pair.

122
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,160
Now the fifth chance is going to be like the decider.

123
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:02,640
If support X has already placed two in a column and only one is left for X to make it win.

124
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,430
So we are calling Choose Player and winning game after this only.

125
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:13,750
And suppose the x comes in a row, then the game will be over, x will win and a popup will appear that

126
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,470
x wins.

127
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,730
Congratulations.

128
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:26,440
So now in this similar way after waiting for, we have set conditions for the beaten five and the panel

129
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:35,320
is also updating like suppose here we have a panel of 15 buttons so one two, three, four, five,

130
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,120
six, seven, eight.

131
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:46,300
So what actually we ten six is so from the panel, it is like five, six, seven, eight like eight

132
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:59,080
panel is considering the like a grid layout of 991 was covered in the frame of panel and the panel of

133
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,020
the eighth one is going to be considered as held the six to be ten six.

134
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:15,310
So yes, we have retained six and after we have initialized the panel eight so we are like setting panels

135
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,070
and then we are setting buttons.

136
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:24,310
So initially we had three panels either on the program and show it to you.

137
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,790
So we had three panels and three buttons.

138
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,920
Now we started incrementing that thing.

139
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:41,170
We made the buttons to 15 and the panels to 15 also, and each panel has a button attached to it and

140
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,500
that is performing some specific tasks.

141
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,000
So we are like checking these nine panels first like.

142
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:56,260
Suppose the what are the actual checking of the we're checking that if a player and then a villa pair

143
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:04,310
they six are kept away in the initial state if any player even then only we are going to update the

144
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,820
scores.

145
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,970
So initially we are going to like listen to the action of these nine blocks.

146
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:18,980
And these six are like we have a complete panel, but only six or nine buttons are going to be listen

147
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,710
for making a player win.

148
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,320
So there are differences.

149
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,520
So we have action is not attached to all the nine buttons.

150
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:36,590
Yes, we have a like a line border, border layout and everything for every panel and between all the

151
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:44,540
actions are listen, we have colors red for the x and blue for the O's and we are choosing the player

152
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,840
every time, like every time action is.

153
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,710
Listen, every time we are choosing a player.

154
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,630
So suppose action is listen for the player race.

155
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:02,060
We are choosing the player o and similar way for the or like actually listen for all we are choosing

156
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,850
the player x and this choose player is the function we have created above hair.

157
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,780
So it was created very early stage I think.

158
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,300
So where it was.

159
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,360
Let me find it for you all so that we can take a look.

160
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,400
So here it was so like we are choosing a player.

161
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:35,900
Initially it was set to X, so by default and if X plays a chance then zero is transferred with the

162
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,040
next john and as X is transferred with the next.

163
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:46,490
So we are calling this choose player again and again, and after which we are calling this winning function

164
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,480
again and again.

165
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:56,330
So the winning function was taking into consideration that what if Player X wins and or player wins?

166
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,610
We discussed earlier.

167
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,000
So again and again we are calling these two functions.

168
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,300
Only inside the action is nurse of the buttons.

169
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:15,470
Now we will try to like run the program and see what are the actual frame layout till now after completing

170
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,760
this part of the code.
