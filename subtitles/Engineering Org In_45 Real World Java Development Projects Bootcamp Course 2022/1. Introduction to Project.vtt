00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:10.500
Our project is Java breakout ball game, which is most commonly known as Big Game, also ball and Big

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.040
Game.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.880
This is very old style retro game, not very high end version of game.

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.760
But our main motto behind this project is to learn how we can create Java swing Java JWT uses, plus

5
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.380
how we can incorporate some object oriented because game is mostly based on object oriented parts or

6
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.190
programming.

7
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.780
So our main aim is to create some object oriented classes, object oriented programs here.

8
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.090
So this is our project.

9
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.280
So let us see what is our basic project aim to?

10
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.180
Create a Java program which is very useful to create a ball game, which is basically a breakout ball

11
00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.480
game.

12
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.250
I'm giving the name, you can say, as the big game, also breaking big game also.

13
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.290
Then steps of development is how we can set up our project then.

14
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.560
Understanding different tools.

15
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.150
What is AWP and what are the things?

16
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.660
Parameters.

17
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.760
I'm going to use Java basic concepts.

18
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.250
I'm going to tell you then Java OP, which is object oriented programming concepts, Java Swing and

19
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.070
how we are going to deploy it as a final.

20
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.020
So if you know how we can create UI for Windows or any platform system within a Java like in a 500 is

21
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.600
a tincture to provide a module of GUI if you know that's very basic and not very higher version of guys.

22
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.810
But there are two categories in Java and one is Java effects and Java swing.

23
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.280
Java Graphics is mostly built on Syn builder and it contains libraries and different things, but Java

24
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.080
Swing comes with JDK.

25
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:06.980
Now that JDK 16 after 11 version of JDK Java thing Swing is completely incorporated within the JDK,

26
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.180
so no need to deploy or no need to fetch another resources from external libraries.

27
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.100
So it's very useful.

28
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.040
Second thing, which is final development, six part final deployment.

29
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.090
So I'm going to deploy.

30
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.680
So that's a basic thing.

31
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.110
I'm going to deploy on my machine only.

32
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.150
But if you know this, you can use Java files and you can create that things.

33
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.980
Also, you can create files of Java files also later to find out those things.

34
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.860
And basically I'm going to create game.

35
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.030
I'm not going to create there like front page how the game is like loop so you can change the UI later

36
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.500
also for that purpose.

37
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.260
So let us understand basic our application requirements.

38
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.580
Java libraries I'm going to use in then JDK Java swing, how I'm going to design JDK and I'm going to

39
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.670
use your intel idea as my main.

40
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920
ID because I'm using it.

41
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.120
It's brain brainchild and it's very useful.

42
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.530
You can use any other you can use Eclipse also and NetBeans also.

43
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.170
That's fine.

44
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.870
Let us see.

45
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.460
These are not application requirements.

46
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.870
Exactly.

47
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.290
It's game requirements.

48
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.130
So in our game, there are three components.

49
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.180
One is pedal.

50
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.480
So while I am telling components, remember these are extra object variable.

51
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.790
Or you can see that's our the object in our program when it's pedal, pedal is basically the thing which

52
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.660
is moving around over that window when ball which is going to hit to the bricks and bricks which are

53
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.940
going to break and we are getting the points then we use we are going to create a game cycle which is

54
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.090
a timer basically.

55
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.610
Remember, we never work with angles in these things.

56
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.720
We are simply change the direction with top, bottom, left, right.

57
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.530
Remember that if you know the structure of gaming technology, we never work with angles mostly why

58
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.740
we are not working with angles because angles are defined.

59
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.450
Like if I am specifying 45 degrees, it will again call it 45 degrees.

60
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.980
So there may be some bugs.

61
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.740
So what we can do, we can work with top, bottom, left, right, so we can mention the direction of

62
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.850
that ball later.

63
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.590
So I will tell you while deploying or developing how we are going to develop these things.

64
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.970
So let us see how I'm going to create these things.

65
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.870
So if you know the thing, how this is going to work basically.

66
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:50.970
So this is the welcome page of Intel idea, which is my idea, which is I'm going to create then hit

67
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.460
enter a new project here.

68
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.810
So wait for some time.

69
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.980
It will deploy you a new project.

70
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.190
For you.

71
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.750
And once this is done, you can check your score.

72
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.090
Go to the Java only.

73
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.830
No need to change anything.

74
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.010
Go to Java only.

75
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.040
For me it's showing the different things you can check for spring and anything but go to Java.

76
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.720
No need to select any library.

77
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.660
Just select your project SDK, which is for me sixteenths.

78
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.040
If you haven't downloaded any SDK or JDK, basically you can download and JDK here, work with that,

79
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.200
then hit next.

80
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.240
Then next.

81
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.370
Then let me give you a name.

82
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.360
So for me, I'm giving breakout ballgame.

83
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.230
So wait for some time to respond.

84
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:33.030
So, Brick, you mentioned the capital break out.

85
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.030
Ball game like this.

86
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.540
And no need to specify anything.

87
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:49.970
If you want to change module or into content truth, you can change after that heat finish, so it will

88
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.030
take time to create a basic template for you.

89
00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:00.740
So wait for some time in your idea to create this partitions and it will go with that part because it's

90
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.840
a higher version of ID, so it will create all the default things which is required.

91
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.390
So wait for some time.

92
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.690
So once this is done, you can check here.

93
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.070
It's currently deploying.

94
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.720
So you can check.

95
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.210
It's currently running.

96
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.380
For me.

97
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.390
So now we are within IED.

98
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:51.560
So in this ID, I will tell you how we are going to perform and how we are going to fetch everything.

99
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:53.940
So.

100
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:14.920
So once this is done, go to this C file or SLC folder.

101
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.980
There is nothing is created basically currently which is basically for the source.

102
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:27.910
So in the source files we are going to deploy and we are going to create each class's, each methods

103
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.660
basically.

104
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.220
So wait for some time.

105
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.430
It's giving me the loading because it's scanning for me.

106
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.510
That's why it's loading.

107
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.290
When this is done, you can go with two approaches.

108
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:46.740
No.

109
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.060
One is you can create what you can do.

110
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.620
You can create some sub package here, some folder subfolder.

111
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.270
You can see subdirectory.

112
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:02.910
Also, you can say and you can create classes within related to that.

113
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:10.430
So currently we required only three main methods like we can deploy with three main methods within that

114
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.970
that three main methods we are going to create different, different classes.

115
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:20.400
But while deploying this you can remember you can always create three different packages.

116
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.480
So I'm not going with sub packages, concepts, I'm giving you a direct what you can say class here,

117
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.820
so wait for some time.

118
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.090
It will do because my system load is very high.

119
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.210
So according to your system, it will take time.

120
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.400
So once this is done, you can check this is now done for me.

121
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.000
So the scanning and everything is, you know, done.

122
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.150
Now one thing you have to do is just click right, click on See.

123
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.080
Then click new.

124
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.200
Or go to new.

125
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.520
It will load for some time.

126
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.730
And Java class.

127
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.850
Now first Java class we are going to work with.

128
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.440
It is basically game play.

129
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.330
Basically we are going to create your gameplay.

130
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.170
So this is basic class we are going to create.

131
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.060
First, remember why I'm creating this class gameplay.

132
00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:01.790
The gameplay is going to work like main architecture behind our any program gameplay, which is going

133
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.800
to perform all the game functions.

134
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.060
The breaking part of brick and everything is going to work here only.

135
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.550
So now it's going to create a gameplay function for me.

136
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.200
So let us check whether it's created.

137
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.810
Okay, now it's created gameplay function.

138
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.010
Let me zoom.

139
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.360
So now you can what you can do.

140
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.150
You can close this part also.

141
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.810
And let us check the gameplay functions, what I'm going to work with.

142
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:06.140
So first gameplay is basically it's going to extend to Japan.

143
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:14.420
Japan is basically for Java team Japan.

144
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.180
Implements.

145
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.300
No.

146
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.590
It is a basic lower class of G panel.

147
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.080
So as you can see, it's giving me the error.

148
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:38.780
So thing you need to import some files later so we will import that files later because it's defaulting.

149
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.480
Listener.

150
00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.920
He is not a Java a thing.

151
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:51.970
Oh.

152
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.400
And what I'm going to need is basically action.

153
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.660
Action listener.

154
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.280
So action listener.

155
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.130
Which is another JWT.

156
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.490
And let me create one store and let me import Java.

157
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.100
X dot swing.

158
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:14.760
Not.

159
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.490
Start.

160
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.800
So currently this thing is not running for me.

161
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.530
Now insert this.

162
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.340
We need to create different, different methods.

163
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.530
So I will tell you what methods.

164
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.330
What methods we are going to work.

165
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.650
But let us.

166
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.200
Assume that we created Japan and everything.

167
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.400
But what is this?

168
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.750
Japan all means?

169
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.870
Japan is for the creation of any window thing in this.

170
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.860
So.

171
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.310
If you know the basic thing in this, it's very easy.

172
00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:01.770
So let me close this and let me incorporate this and we will create another thing here.

173
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.230
Panel is not completely done here.

174
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:15.800
So I imported 232 things java a w t these things and later we will need this also import java dot util

175
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.150
which is basically for utilization of data utilities.

176
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.260
So for this I created let me create one private boolean.

177
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.180
Private Boolean play, which is always false at the start.

178
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.130
False at the start.

179
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.320
So let me mention as a false within the start.

180
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.020
Then one private int score score is always zero at the start.

181
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:50.950
So let me mention score at zero and let me tell you why I created these two functions and and why it's

182
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.340
private.

183
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.890
So let us assume you are playing game.

184
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.380
But at the start of game your score is 100.

185
00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:01.060
That's invalid or or else user can change the code.

186
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.590
If it's public, user can change their code and they can cheat in the game also.

187
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.750
So for that purpose I'm creating this.

188
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.940
Then I'm considering here.

189
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.750
My bricks are static here as a.

190
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:25.840
So BRICS let me mention that 48 only I'm considering my brix of 48 then private time.

191
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.870
But I with time I can create in this job a private timer.

192
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.320
Which is basically going to function with time.

193
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.170
And once I'm importing this, no need to use that also.

194
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:46.430
Okay.

195
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.910
Oh, I don't know why, but.

196
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:54.730
Okay.

197
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.900
Let me import these also.

198
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.420
And now.

199
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.470
There is maybe some delay also.

200
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.610
So let me mention delay of some 8 seconds here

201
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.100
to provide the delay then.

202
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.600
But I await in a exposition I'm going to mention.

203
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.720
Clear exposition is this three?

204
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.990
Let me mention 310.

205
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.440
So if you know these things like X and y axis, you should remember that three, ten or otherwise.

206
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.030
You can copy this then.

207
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:46.860
But I went into ball position and to mention so bowl pose x x axis position is one pointy always always

208
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.800
means while at the starting point then private end ball pose.

209
00:16:53.590 --> 00:17:00.670
Y is equal to again 3050 and mentioning that so coordinate things or pixel things you can remember.

210
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.600
And I need to mention x direction.

211
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.770
Bollixed direction.

212
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:19.760
Let me mention that is minus one direction is minus one always and private ball or.

213
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:29.610
So this ball wide direction and it's minus two always so it will go up per part, not the downward part.

214
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.080
And I will create your one map generator.

215
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.370
So I will later create that map generator class and everything.

216
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.210
But.

217
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:46.170
Do not return, which is basically for the creation of map.

218
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.790
So I will create my app generator class later.

219
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.910
But remember, I'm going to create this.

220
00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:00.260
Now let us create one oblique gameplay here, which is basically constructor I'm going to use here.

221
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.000
And inside this constructor.

222
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.630
So let me mention to pass the value.

223
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.520
Construct.

224
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.240
So to pass values.

225
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.580
So I'm using your constructor to pass values.

226
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:27.940
So basically, if, you know, constructor is basically used for this and as it's public, I'm going

227
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.960
to create this.

228
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:39.960
So if you know I'm using my generator again, I haven't created any map generator class, but I'm using

229
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.280
this as.

230
00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.930
So for my toilets, my map by default.

231
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.910
And I will create that part.

232
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.620
So that's it for this.

233
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.960
In the further part, we will check how we are going to develop and deploy this.

234
00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.180
All these things help you understand.

235
00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:03.940
In the later part, we will check how we are going to create map generator and then classes, game plays,

236
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.870
basic command.

237
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.570
So I started with this.

238
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.670
If you want to check out how I'm going to create map generator, you should look out first for map generator

239
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.120
part.
