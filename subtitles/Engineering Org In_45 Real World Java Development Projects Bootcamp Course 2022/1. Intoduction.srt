00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:07,650
So our project has a store billing system which is developed by using Java programming language.

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,900
In this video we will be talking about the introduction of this project.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,030
Overview of the project.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,010
The main objective of the store billing system is to manage the details of seller's cashiers, products

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,790
and sales.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,080
It manages all the information about products, stocks, etc..

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,820
The project project is built at both administrative and end user and also does both the admin and user

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,610
are guaranteed the access of the backend database.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,910
The purpose of this project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,990
product sales.

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,460
Contents.

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,120
Introduction Requirements, Project Setup and components.

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,660
Introduction of the project is top billing system is a software based application is a desktop based

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,530
application.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,670
This app enables the customer to perform the basic sale and purchase operation.

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:11,200
The system provides the access to the admin to create an account of cashier and product or to stock

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,270
manage sales of products.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,300
The cashier can access this application for waiving the sale details and perform the operations on account

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,830
as per the requirements.

20
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,760
Requirements for this project.

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,700
Hardware requirement a processor clock speed of 1.7 gigahertz system powers of 64 bit monitor, LCD

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,080
monitor or any laptop, a standard keyboard, compatible mouse or any touchpad software requirements.

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:47,240
Windows ten A microsoft Maya SQL Server frontend is developed by using Java code swing with the help

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,370
of NetBeans IDE and backend is developed by using MySQL to store the database.

25
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,360
Set up of the project.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,570
First of all, install MySQL if not installed at first, then we will create a database in my SQL named

27
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,960
as SBS, which is the abbreviation of a stored billing system.

28
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,940
Then we will be creating three tables named as a stock sale and user.

29
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:16,600
After that, we will insert values of sale table, so we will be inserting values of sale table.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,980
Then we have to install NetBeans IDE if not install.

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,840
Or you can also use any supporting IDs as well for the Java development.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,780
Then we will create a new project named as a store billing system and start coding our Java classes.

33
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,850
Components of the project will be our database named as SBS.

34
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,470
Some Java files named as ADD Cashier Add Product Admin Panel DB Abbreviation of database delete cashier

35
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:51,920
delete product generate invoice, log in sale and few more classes will be there a package inside which

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,640
all these classes.

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,420
So there will be a package named as a store inside which all these classes with inside libraries will

38
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,780
be used.

39
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,110
My SQL Java Connector, which will help us to connect our project with our MySQL database and JDK 17,

40
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,560
which will be a development kit to develop this project.

41
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,780
That's all in the introduction video.
