1
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:10.390
So in previous part I told you like how we created that silver thing in CMD or we can say command prompt

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.780
itself in this part.

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.510
What I'm going to tell you how we can create some UI part here.

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.820
So I will tell you how we can create the UI each and everything.

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.720
So let us see how we proceed with our project.

6
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.210
And you're also I'm considering you familiar with in Europe, as I told you first here.

7
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.120
So let us see how we can do this part.

8
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.470
So.

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.970
Let me go with that project also.

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.290
So this is interesting and I'd just we needed these two things.

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.570
So.

12
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.390
Okay, so these are all the things I needed a buffer reader.

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.850
I exception input print writer, server socket part socket part and vector part.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.350
So vector is nothing.

15
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.700
But you can say like ArrayList, but it's a vector.

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:08.310
So remember as a ArrayList like you can consist only one single type of data or all the things are converted

17
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:18.270
into the strings, but in a vector it doesn't require you can use any part and vector to call each instance

18
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.760
of classes of client handler.

19
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.760
So what the purpose of Victor is?

20
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.250
It can hold each instance instead of ArrayList.

21
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.750
It is putting the ID.

22
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.510
I can directly put each instances into the vector, so let us first run main method which throws exception.

23
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.420
You can use trick edge or you can use through the exception.

24
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.600
So this is my server socket which is 2020.

25
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.960
I'm considering then in ISE equal to zero because I just want to initiate the loop.

26
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.150
Or we can say this is the basic thing.

27
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.380
Now the server is connecting via I don't I want to do this is it is running the client head basically

28
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.740
it's going to run the client thread so it needs to do what for the thread one it should be going in

29
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.620
the one part id is one then second.

30
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.470
Similarly I just want to plus plus that part.

31
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.100
So current plan count it will be showing in the server part socket connection that accept each and everything

32
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.540
part except is the default thing.

33
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.570
Here then is just a connection.

34
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.880
Print output is for the gate connection output stream and buffer reader input is to input reduction

35
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.040
basically to connect.

36
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.780
So it is basically input stream.

37
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.990
I always remember auto flash is too true.

38
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.560
If there is error it will be auto flashed through the project.

39
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.550
What is it?

40
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.150
Will not show any garbage value.

41
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.180
Everything.

42
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.340
And it will add it in that package.

43
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.360
So this is.

44
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.840
I'm handling the thread and I'm adding this.

45
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:59.810
So if you know, in no further videos, in previous videos I told you I extended that part here and

46
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.580
implements the Enable interface.

47
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.940
So for the socket connection connect output strength client I created.

48
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.560
So for this I can create a one constructor for this and for the receiver.

49
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.690
I'll throw exceptions then same string, then message I'm considering.

50
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.990
Then this is a socket size each and everything I'm mentioning here and client wants to end this connection.

51
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.900
I'm putting this message width and each and everything.

52
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.800
Then if someone leaves that, it will show the client has left that server part and client handler.

53
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.660
So this is just one function.

54
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.220
So server is very similar.

55
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.290
Like we could already created the server.

56
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.990
But remember I'm considering here one client handler also here which is basically implemented by the

57
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.090
interface instead of using TROs instead of using thread or extending that thread, I'm considering your

58
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.100
enable interface.

59
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.390
So let us see client part here.

60
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.140
The client part is very important here because I'm creating.

61
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.500
Java extreme.

62
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.970
So client red or we can say client setup.

63
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.300
First class client setup is all about Jawa, which is a frame exchange.

64
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.840
Geotextile is for the text field text area for chat window.

65
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.060
You can say why I'm creating text if you want to put some message on that part.

66
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.190
If you see that, you have to type that message.

67
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.700
That package text will text about chat window.

68
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.530
Print writer output is output and each and everything, you know.

69
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.890
I created string for that purpose.

70
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.060
Jay Frames followed that framing purpose I'm creating here two times.

71
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.770
One is outer and one is inner frame.

72
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.560
Frame is nothing but your due frame.

73
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.990
Only then public lens set up for the set up over all the things.

74
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.980
If one is first frame, then I'm considering your one host over IP, then if one which set size, I'm

75
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.510
setting the size 3004.

76
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.590
It is very easy.

77
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.440
Basically, I'm considering one label.

78
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.590
Enter your name first.

79
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.910
Otherwise it will not put though for the first frame.

80
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.060
You have to put your name then, otherwise you will not enter in your part.

81
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.380
You can add another filter.

82
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.060
Also your number, your email, anything you can add.

83
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.680
I'm considering a one button button.

84
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.640
Basically we submit and I am adding the action listener part here actually means when I click this part,

85
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:31.080
what it will do, it will dispose that part and it will go to the that part and default which close

86
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.180
now f two with another frame with one text area and one text.

87
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.550
As I told you, first frame is about to enter your name and second field is about two.

88
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.510
Or we can say text frame is about to enter all the things like your message and each and everything.

89
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.190
It's not like if you want to close or in that part I created one button there also and as you can see

90
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.840
if I connected in button there in dot or as you can see, this is the end button.

91
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.900
If I connect or add action listener, basically, if I click that in button, what will you do?

92
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.010
It will message that client want to send connection to that server and it will be disclosed.

93
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.780
Then I created one main panel with bottom panel and each and everything.

94
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.270
So and I'm setting the size.

95
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.960
So this is all about how you can proceed with this.

96
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.270
So important part is public voice.

97
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.160
Start running, try to connect server setup streams while chatting.

98
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.900
So these are all the methods I already created, but you can mention that earlier.

99
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.150
Also, if there is EOF section which is basically server not found exception, the exception is for

100
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.860
the exception part each and everything.

101
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.870
So first is connect to server.

102
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.240
Connect to server is basically throwing exception.

103
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.880
So what you can do is show attempting connection socket and server IP and the port.

104
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.420
So I will tell you server is our local host.

105
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.700
But when we created this, we have to change or we have to change this part or to our engine thing and

106
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.420
each and everything.

107
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:08.490
So, so show message face first basically destroying the message, set up output stream for output stream

108
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.420
and each and everything.

109
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.350
So your stream is now good to go.

110
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.320
You can add or you are you you can add anything new by chatting.

111
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.520
You can do that read line part for this.

112
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.110
And what is the read length.

113
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.750
It's basically the this string print writer or above.

114
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.700
Sorry, but for reader, print writer is for the output part and close stream is for the closing the

115
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.210
stream.

116
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.650
Send messages basically for the print writer pack.

117
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.190
So this is how you can do and show message.

118
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.560
We have to chat, window, append or we can swing titles.

119
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.330
You can do in work later and you have to append in the chat window that part final string.

120
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.650
You have to open that strings.

121
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.180
So this is it.

122
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.710
But for the client setup, we need to mention the host here.

123
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.070
So I already checked this in Europe.

124
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.320
So I added here and after this you have to start running process.

125
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.530
So this is all about how we can handle each and everything.

126
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.210
So let me run this part, what we required.

127
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.070
First, we need to create one engine.

128
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:15.540
So let me create one in G Rock, TCP 2020.

129
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.420
So.

130
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.650
Okay, so.

131
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.080
Let me first assume this part.

132
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.940
In G dot xy DCP 2020.

133
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.970
So it will be running that in zero.

134
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.420
Okay.

135
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.970
Okay, so what is thing you have to always remember?

136
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.710
You have to create only one connection.

137
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.680
You cannot proceed with more than one connection always.

138
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:12.230
So if the more things are running here, what you can do is you can check your system and if the engine

139
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.060
is running, you have to end that task or what you can say, ending that path.

140
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:22.420
So for the three purposes and you use only one connection.

141
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:36.910
And all.

142
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.890
But EFC Dxb 2020.

143
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.270
So let me check first.

144
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.460
If I connected or not.

145
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:58.570
So sometimes it gives the error due to you have connected to more than one session.

146
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.470
So if it's not working, you have to run it again.

147
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:12.550
Or you have to go to your what you can see that command prompt part or you can see the task manager

148
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.090
part and you have to close it manually if it's not working.

149
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.360
So now let me run the engine for.

150
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.610
So hope you're going to see this in Rockport.

151
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.390
Let me run first in G Dog DCP 2020.

152
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.330
Okay.

153
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.160
So first.

154
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.700
So this is how you can run this engine first.

155
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:26.810
Well, no.

156
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.580
My connection is life, you can see.

157
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.970
I'm not here to check this post because you have to check the injury report.

158
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:35.930
So this is my injury.

159
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.430
Thing, which is basically six.

160
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.000
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to change this 4 to 6.

161
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:49.690
Once this is running, I'm considering your only it's one time running, so I'm not creating it again

162
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.170
and again.

163
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.040
This is my port.

164
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.630
14 to 0 five 414 to 0 five.

165
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.600
We're going to.

166
00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.150
Zero for you.

167
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.340
So now my connection is low.

168
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.180
So let me show you how we can do this first.

169
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.110
So.

170
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.090
Let me run first server part.

171
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:18.250
So what he did was just basically the command prompt part only because we don't need to create any part

172
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:18.690
here.

173
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.530
So this is my server part.

174
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.480
Now let me run my client by.

175
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.900
So client is basically I'm just I just created that client part.

176
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.760
Let me run one more client, which is basically client two part.

177
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.290
And let me add both simultaneously.

178
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.800
In my teens.

179
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.370
So this is my first client, as you can see here.

180
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.880
So I'm running this Java client.

181
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.150
Let me add one more client here.

182
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.390
When showing you.

183
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.790
So this is my another client, as you can see here.

184
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.430
So these are the two clients.

185
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.500
You can see this if you want.

186
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.850
I will increase this part for you.

187
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.390
Okay.

188
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.880
So hope you can see this part.

189
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.370
So let me run both names.

190
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.680
John, as usual, submit.

191
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.990
So once this is submitted, you can see your streams now.

192
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.740
Good to go.

193
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.940
So.

194
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.400
Let me add that another part also.

195
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.230
So let me run first, John.

196
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.840
Or we can say.

197
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:30.790
John Trump.

198
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.120
So this is John.

199
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.780
We're just sending high.

200
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.120
Now let me send from part.

201
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.480
Hello.

202
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.240
Still hope you can see this same part also here.

203
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:58.330
So what you are saying this this is my chat and this is my ending.

204
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.240
So this is a very basic thing we have created with you.

205
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.270
You can more advanced part, you can implement the Android part also here if you want.

206
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.240
But this is the basic logic how you can create the chat application.

207
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.550
Once I click this in part.

208
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.990
What you can do.

209
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.060
Let me.

210
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.170
And that part also you.

211
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.060
So you can see John has the lived server you can see.

212
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.420
So I just added that part and let me close this.

213
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.620
So this is it.

214
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.570
We can do this part.

215
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.800
So.

216
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.340
This is the thing with indie rock.

217
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:44.130
And now you can see this client part and this is finished, but you can see server count here.

218
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.650
So current line count is zero and each and everything.

219
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.350
Now the current plan client count is again zero.

220
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.550
So this is it how you can run each and everything impact.

221
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.830
So I created one client.

222
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.560
You can create one more add ons.

223
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.650
You have it some black colors or each and everything.

224
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.860
But I just showed you, showing you this is part.

225
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.650
So this is the multi thread chat system.

226
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:14.820
It is very useful in different applications like if you have seen some games also there on online games

227
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.430
there are chat windows for that purpose.

228
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:25.410
So similarly, if you are using some minimalistic or chat application you want to use just for the sending

229
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.310
text only you can use, you can use add images part.

230
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.500
Also you can add emojis also here.

231
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.600
So these are some more advanced technique in DHCP, but it's taken advantage of.

232
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:45.330
This is it is very fast as you can see, it is very fast basically in a TCP way or but more for other

233
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:52.730
things are very useful easier you can use in different applications with it's very flexible and powerful.

234
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.940
If you have seen if your network connection is very low, you can use it efficient.

235
00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.540
Second best programming can be implemented for the general communication.

236
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.240
Lots of low traffic if efficiently used.

237
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.210
Only updated information can be sent.

238
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.820
You can see disadvantages.

239
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:17.530
Basically Java applets also establish some connection on DHCP so you can create applet off or you can

240
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.450
say java servlet of this part.

241
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.940
Sockets allow only raw data to send, which is basically client to server.

242
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.850
And you have to mention some interpret data.

243
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.000
You cannot send full text to that.

244
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.290
It should be converted into byte stream always.

245
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.190
Then another thing is any can anyone can enter in this application.

246
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:45.800
So there is no restrictions, but you can add restrictions like you can add some password or username

247
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.080
fields and each and everything you can create.

248
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:54.530
So again, it will create some secure prompt and there are some secure advanced methods.

249
00:17:54.530 --> 00:18:02.810
Also such things also in TCP chat and file handling and sharing is very difficult process in multi trading.

250
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.400
So you have to consider all the things here while creating, file handling and each and everything.

251
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.980
So this is it about how we can do this.

252
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.170
And these are the advantages and disadvantages.

253
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:16.820
But advantages are moreover than disadvantages in TCP connection.

254
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.540
So still there are some technologies using PCB part.

255
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.170
So we created one TCP port things here.

256
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:32.480
So hope you understand this part and this is it about how we can create our project TCP or we can say

257
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:39.770
multi trading chat system within client and server, or we can mention each client many client chat

258
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.370
system.
