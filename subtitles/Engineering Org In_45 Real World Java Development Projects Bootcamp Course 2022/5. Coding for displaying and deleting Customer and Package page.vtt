WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.720
Here we are.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.650
This is our class view of customer java, which is defined inside the package travel.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.950
We have imported the necessary packages.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.030
Then there is a public class wave customer which is extending the frame.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.050
We have defined

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.100
this class and after that we have defined the connection is instance as null a j panel a table and there

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.170
are six labels.

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.840
Inside the main function, we have called our class and set the visibility of the frame as true.

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.140
After that we have defined the non parameter as constructor of the.

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.490
Class setting the default close operation for the window.

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.630
Bound for the window.

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.670
Defining a new panel.

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.950
But of that panel, adding it to the frame and setting the layout of that panel.

14
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.400
Then we are creating an image and adding that image to the label, adding that label to our frame.

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.550
After that, we have created another image.

16
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.850
Adding that image to the label, setting the tone for the label, adding that label to the frame.

17
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.020
After that, we have created the new instance of the table setting the bound for the table, adding

18
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.340
that table to our panel.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.860
Then inside the block, we have initialized the connection and created a query inside the string that

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.010
is select as from customer because that is a view customer class.

21
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.430
So it will use to show the check the details of the customer.

22
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.120
So results that are stored execute will display customer.

23
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.300
So this will execute the query inside the string.

24
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.640
Then we have set the table model.

25
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.460
This will set the model for the table.

26
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.570
How the table will look like in our output cache block will handle any exception.

27
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.240
If it occurs, then there is a button button you knew button back, which is a back button which will

28
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.980
be used to move back from this window.

29
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.900
Inside it sets an action performance method.

30
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.160
We have set the visibility of the current window as follows and this button will be used to close this

31
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.460
window.

32
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.220
Then we have set the bound for the button.

33
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.700
Background colour and foreground colour of the button.

34
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.200
Added that button to our.

35
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.040
Frame after that.

36
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.230
We have.

37
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.720
On the label.

38
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.680
Named as user name and label type.

39
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.880
And the label has a number.

40
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.230
Then there is a name, a label as a name, and under the label, gender, country, address, phone

41
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.250
number, email.

42
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.800
And at last we have set the background color of fight.

43
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.950
Remember for all of these labels.

44
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.380
We have set the bounds of these labels, which will show the location and size of these labels, and

45
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.890
added that those labels to our panel so that this will be available and shown whenever we will see the

46
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.270
details of the customers.

47
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.740
So.

48
00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.630
This is about the consumer class, which will be used to see the output or details of the customers

49
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.570
which have been stored in our database.

50
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.280
Now let's have a look on the delete customer class, which will be used to delete the details of the

51
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.900
customer.

52
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.990
So this.

53
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.480
Class have also been defined inside the package travel.

54
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.910
The necessary packages have been imported after we have defined the class, which is extending the frame.

55
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.280
There is a private instance of a panel.

56
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.910
And the choice even then we have.

57
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.930
Defined the main method inside which we have created the instance of the current class and set the visibility

58
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.400
of that class as true.

59
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.730
After that, we have defined the normal non parameter constructor for our class that is delete customer

60
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.740
constructor for which we have set the bound for the panel.

61
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.780
Creating another panel setting panel to frame and its layout.

62
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.040
After that, we have created an image adding that image to the label, setting the bound for that label,

63
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.540
adding that label to our frame.

64
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.850
After that, there is another label.

65
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.100
Labeling delete customer details, setting font for it, bound for it, and adding that label to our

66
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.860
panel.

67
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.030
After that, there is a label L three, which is user name setting bound for it, adding that to a frame.

68
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.310
After that, there is a choice instance for which we have created the connection inside that block.

69
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.070
We have created the results set query which will be executing select select extract from customer for

70
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.760
while next.

71
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:36.810
This will add the user names of the customer in our C one choice instance, and then we will close the

72
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.810
RS connection and after that we will set the bound for the C one choice and add that second choice to

73
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.560
our frame.

74
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.310
After that, there is a label ID setting bound for it, adding that to our.

75
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.020
Panel.

76
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.240
Then there is a label which is a label which does not label selling bound for it, adding that to our

77
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.840
panel.

78
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.930
After that, there is a label number setting bound for it and adding that to our panel.

79
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.420
Then there is another record label sitting bound for it and adding that to our panel.

80
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.620
Then there's another label name setting bound for it, adding that to our panel with respect to it.

81
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.470
There is another back end label setting bound for it, adding that to our panel.

82
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.580
Similarly for here, we have a panel label for gender setting bound for it, adding that, adding that

83
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.390
top panel.

84
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.820
Then with respect to the gender, there is a.

85
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.540
Record label setting bound for it.

86
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.710
Adding to that, our panel.

87
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.100
Then there is a label for the country similarly for it, which we have.

88
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.090
Record label.

89
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.610
Then there is for the permanent label.

90
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.650
With respect, there is a back end label.

91
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.640
After that, there is a label checking status, label phone number.

92
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.160
With respect to we have a label.

93
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.270
Back and label.

94
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.760
After that there is a label for the email.

95
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.410
With respect to that, we have an empty label now inside the button check.

96
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.890
This is the button check label.

97
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.740
Let's check for the button check.

98
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.080
We have performed the X and performed which will establish a connection with our database and execute

99
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.320
a query inside the right that is select as from customer where user is equals to see one product selected

100
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.750
item.

101
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:30.600
So the user name which we will select from the choice one which for that particular user name, that

102
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.530
record of that customer will be fetched from the customer table and then we will add those respective

103
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:47.280
fields of that customer and present add those fields to our labels that we have first initialized as

104
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.580
NULL.

105
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.820
These labels like HL7 does not have a value.

106
00:06:50.820 --> 00:07:00.630
So then we have set the text in these labels so that we can the information of that customer will be

107
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.240
appeared in our window.

108
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.460
When we will click on this check button.

109
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.550
Then we have set the bound for that button background filter for that button, foreground color forward

110
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.770
button and adding that button to our panel after after that we have created another button.

111
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.950
Delete or delete button will be used to delete the record.

112
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.490
So inside action performed, establish the connection with the database class.

113
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:34.650
Then inside the trip log we have created the string as 17. get selected item which will select the username

114
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:40.740
from the choice I inside the string key when we have created the query update from customer where username

115
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.790
will be S1.

116
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:48.540
So for the particular username, the this statement will fetch the record for that particular customer.

117
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:55.380
Now see start execute query will execute the query and update the information in the table and display

118
00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:02.250
a dialog box by using option pane which will display customer details deleted successfully.

119
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.830
Cache block will underline the exception if a course.

120
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.370
Then we have set the bound for the button background color of the button foreground color of the button

121
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.320
and adding that button to our panel.

122
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:18.240
Then there is the exit button back for which we have defined the action perform method inside which

123
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.300
we will setting the visibility of the current window as false.

124
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.280
After that, we have set the bound for the exit button background colour, for example, for the exit

125
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.920
button and adding that exit into our panel.

126
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:34.860
At last we have defined the background colour of the window as white.

127
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.520
Then there is another class, which is a check package class.

128
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.980
So let's have a look on the check tag class.

129
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.810
It is defined inside the package travel.

130
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.420
We have defined its imported packages.

131
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:52.590
0.0.8.106. swing public class check package extending j frame.

132
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.880
In the main function, we have created the object of the check package and set the visibility of the

133
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.020
frame as true.

134
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.250
We have defined the non parameterized constructor of this class inside which you have set the bound

135
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.600
for the window, setting the visibility of the window as true.

136
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.820
After that, there is a three.

137
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.900
Array of strengths.

138
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.190
Package one, package to package three, which will be containing the information of the package.

139
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:25.250
First column of first element of both trace strings containing the images, name and extension.

140
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.230
After that, there is a gold package, silver package, brand package, then 67 nights with respect

141
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.290
to package details.

142
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:40.040
These strings will be containing and after that there is a we have defined tab the pain and create that

143
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:47.430
pain by using a pin and added that tab pin or added package within that tab pin.

144
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:53.390
Similarly, for the P to edit package two and similarly for the P three, we have added package three.

145
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.040
Then we have added the tab to pin with the border layout center in our frame.

146
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.430
After that, there is a public panel create package.

147
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:11.100
So this is a method which is returning panel and it is taking a string of packs.

148
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:17.450
So it will take a string of pack and it will take an array of strings.

149
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.560
Now we have defined the panel, set the layout background color, white, we have defined an image,

150
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:28.220
added that to label setting the bound for the label, adding that label to our panel, after which we

151
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.760
have defined another label pack.

152
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:31.490
Similarly

153
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.090
now pack one.

154
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.720
So this label will be storing the pack one.

155
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:45.000
Element of the pack one string which will be passed to it under the label, pack two, pack three.

156
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.400
Similarly for the respective elements, there are label pack for five, six, seven.

157
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.410
Then there is a pack eight.

158
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.490
Nine, ten and 11, all the bags have been added.

159
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.620
So this is the check package class.

160
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.140
So let me show you the result of this class.

161
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.630
So first we will be running the customer class.

162
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.860
So run file.

163
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:10.920
This is how the customer class will look like as they have not added any customer details.

164
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.770
So no details have been shown yet.

165
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.380
We will be adding those details and.

166
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.890
The library of this program.

167
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.730
I will click on back.

168
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.920
Now let me show you the delete customer class how it will look like.

169
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.690
Parent file.

170
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.940
This is how the customer class look.

171
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:34.850
User name list does not contain any list as we have not added any customer when we will add the customer.

172
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.280
Then the list of the user names will appear here and we have to select a one user name to delete.

173
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.320
And after that we will.

174
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.020
Then we press on check.

175
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.750
Then these.

176
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:50.960
All the details of that user name will be shown here, but as there are no any user yet in our database,

177
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.000
so that's why it is not showing it.

178
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.660
Then there is a check package class.

179
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.920
Let me run this also.

180
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.850
So this is the package check package class where you can check the details of the package.

181
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.100
So package one is gold package.

182
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.920
These are the details of the package and there is the rate return package when you can click on package

183
00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.640
to package three as well.

184
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.980
So these are the packages.

185
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.460
Let me close this.

186
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.920
So in this video, we have learned about these three classes.
