1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,640
In previous things I created the gameplay and we are done with gameplay method.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,750
Now I'm going to create one another thing which is basically map generator.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,030
So I'm going to create another class right click on inside source folder.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,650
Go to New.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,210
You can check your loading menu.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,640
Go to Java class and mention as name map generator.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,010
My generator so it will give me when you public class map generator.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,260
So I'm using it only.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,670
I'm moving you down a little bit.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,050
You can minimize this.

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,180
And now in map generator.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,910
First thing, I need to create a 2D map.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,070
So for two D at a similar thing I'm going to create here as we are creating two very.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,640
As map I'm creating as a 2D array.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,880
First team first public int required tiny dimension brick built.

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,020
Then public.

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,720
In.

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,290
Brick, right.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,730
So if you look closely, look this or this is the similar thing.

20
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,210
I'm calling here.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,350
Brick.

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,730
So these things will be resolved when I clear the map and everything.

23
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:57,780
Now I need to create one constructor of yours so you can use your old insert to go with the constructor.

24
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,950
But let me create it as it is.

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,780
Map generator, default package.

26
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:14,070
Or you can check in row for row purpose and int column or column purposes, which is going to put in

27
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,990
that part only, which is.

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,150
Smart.

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,040
Is equal to new.

30
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,720
India's India's end.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,190
Rule.

32
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,600
Gone.

33
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,700
So it will put in that part.

34
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:40,150
Or in again, that iReport, which is basically generating some values for map and putting in a map

35
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,840
length.

36
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,980
My blend.

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:44,890
I.

38
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,120
Bliss.

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,690
Bliss.

40
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,140
And one more look.

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,720
Basically for.

42
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,770
And G is equal to zero.

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:05,460
JS less than maplin again, but not yet maplin map zero which is basically at the starting position

44
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:05,820
of map.

45
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:07,610
Lend.

46
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,340
Duplass Plus.

47
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,380
Map.

48
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,380
I meant G.

49
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,590
She should be one.

50
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,030
So I need to mention this.

51
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,030
After this.

52
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,330
I need to mention it.

53
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,020
So.

54
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,390
Brick width and height.

55
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,210
Create width and height.

56
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,260
Liquid.

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,610
540 divide by column.

58
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,100
Actually directly depends on this and when 50 divided by.

59
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,750
So it will take directly.

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,050
So I need not to mention everything again and again.

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,990
Now.

62
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,760
Public void.

63
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,860
Which is basically the shooting this part directly.

64
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:13,380
So it will divide in a similar or as its end so it will round figure edit the width or you can number

65
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,990
of color bricks in that map.

66
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,950
Let me mention one drop.

67
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,010
Graphics.

68
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,750
2D.

69
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,560
Graphics, 2d.

70
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,090
G.

71
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,170
Yes.

72
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,470
So once I call this, you can check here a W is called.

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,860
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create one or loop not want loop for loop.

74
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,350
With the end I.

75
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,600
Zero.

76
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,760
Then I maplin is maplin only.

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,990
At length.

78
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,890
I plus plus till that maplin.

79
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,940
So.

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,060
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this part because.

81
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,810
And very.

82
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:16,890
So.

83
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,350
Okay, so these things are done.

84
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,350
Now, let me mention this.

85
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,100
Everything here.

86
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,450
So.

87
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,600
If Mapp is having ICOM g.

88
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,240
Might not matter.

89
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,940
Everything is greater than zero, which is basically ideal condition.

90
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,970
Or G dot said color.

91
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,920
I'm going to set color cc0r dot.

92
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:48,840
Wait.

93
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,600
Why?

94
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,410
It's not this color that white, which is basically white color.

95
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,500
It's going to set to the bricks white.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,440
And G dot.

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,620
Fill that rectangle.

98
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,510
Ignore this error.

99
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,370
It's giving me some kind of error of ID, so we will resolve it later.

100
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,210
But it needs to create that with brick width.

101
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,420
Not you with.

102
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,920
Yes.

103
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Liquidity is for liquid plus 80.

104
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:36,070
With I start it should be mentioned with brick height, the height plus 50.

105
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,870
With which the and height as my main things.

106
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:51,850
So it will go with field rectangle or you can say creating whole the rectangle as my main part.

107
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,170
Now these things are done.

108
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,210
Now this.

109
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,060
With her to show I'm going to create that method separate.

110
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,540
Brick.

111
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,100
Game.

112
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,910
It is basically going to separate the brick and grime so it will clear another rectangle from it.

113
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,380
So you basically can still run without it also.

114
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,390
So it is for testing purpose.

115
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,560
You can check, but.

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,390
Very important method that stroke I need to mention stroke.

117
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,650
New.

118
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,930
Basic stroke.

119
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,690
WW 33.

120
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,010
I'm going to mention as three.

121
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,880
With which stroke is basically now state color method.

122
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,450
You are not.

123
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,750
Black.

124
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,120
I guess I.

125
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,880
Black first is Rachel G dot.

126
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,610
Now again I need to mention draw rectangular here.

127
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,590
So.

128
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,660
Rectangular.

129
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
And again the similar theme this.

130
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,730
I tried everything.

131
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,940
It's similar again.

132
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,880
With a D in everything.

133
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,900
Everything is similar.

134
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,630
No.

135
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,520
I created this, but I need to set brick value also so public.

136
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,680
Boyd set.

137
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,890
Brick.

138
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,860
We you.

139
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,840
In.

140
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:48,730
Which is basically I'm going to mention how much thing it's not to mention the raw slush in column.

141
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,030
And now in this column, I'm going to create map.

142
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:56,980
Raw.

143
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,990
Column.

144
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,700
Is equal to hell.

145
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,170
So it will create different things for me.

146
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,270
And I guess.

147
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,640
Wait a minute.

148
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,490
I closed the class, and that's not proper.

149
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,130
Now it's.

150
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,680
Now, if you go to these things.

151
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,890
You can check.

152
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,210
Starting me for the resolving any purpose.

153
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,620
And now you can check.

154
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,710
There are there will be no errors in our gameplay because I created a map generator function.

155
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,750
So this will create a map and this will create a functions.

156
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,450
Now what things are remaining?

157
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,020
I call this, but I won't set main method.

158
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
I'm not creating any main method.

159
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,460
So for that purpose I'm going to create one main method here.

160
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,400
Before that.

161
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:50,900
Okay.

162
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,390
Clear on and close.

163
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,510
So what I'm going to do is this is my generator function is done.

164
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,380
Game plays.

165
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,310
Function is done.

166
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,950
Now I need to mention your main function to call this map generator and gameplay functions in the main

167
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,460
method.

168
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,800
So I'm giving this main only.

169
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,090
In this mean?

170
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,720
Obviously to run any main method you need.

171
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,830
Public static void main you can check swim only swim is enough.

172
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,840
Public static point main it should be print.

173
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,640
Jeffrey.

174
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,480
Dear friend, I'm calling as an object here.

175
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,070
New frame.

176
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,700
You're like smitten or Java effects.

177
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,570
You can check it.

178
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,540
Gameplay.

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So it's my default class gameplay.

180
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,240
With gameplay, I'm going to create your gameplay.

181
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,810
But what I'm going to do is hear gameplay camel case.

182
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,570
I'm going to use your gameplay with new obviously gameplay default package.

183
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
Now I need to mention the boundaries of my object.

184
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,220
Object?

185
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,630
Which set bounds.

186
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,780
With a rectangular, which is basically my rectangular ten by ten by height.

187
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,330
I'm going to mention this will be the.

188
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,160
Of width and height, x ray, width and height.

189
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,300
Now I need to mention object title for this title.

190
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,900
So subtitle name changes.

191
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,100
Mm.

192
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,300
Break.

193
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:39,880
Hope.

194
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,170
Ball.

195
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,500
Game, which in my title breakout one game.

196
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,880
Oh no, said Resizable, which is basically disguising the part and don't want to do that.

197
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,290
So I'm mentioning as false.

198
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,650
If you are going to resize, it will default.

199
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,810
It will be create deformities in mapping functions which is basically creating this.

200
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:12,980
So I'm mentioning as this as should be avoided and set visible, which is basically creating a visible

201
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,020
now it should be true while running.

202
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,800
It should be true.

203
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,600
Now I need to mention your running function.

204
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,700
So for this object dot state.

205
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,800
Default.

206
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,940
Close operation, which is basically closing Operation J Frame.

207
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,060
Jeffrey.

208
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,460
With.

209
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,590
Except on clothes is basically going to fix it.

210
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,220
So if I close, it should be closed and object.

211
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,830
Which I'm going to add basically gameplay.

212
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,190
And again.

213
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,200
It visible.

214
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,720
And it should be, too.

215
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:12,430
No I created this main so gameplay is I'm going to create here map generator is going to generate a

216
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,280
map and main method is going to load this.

217
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,750
So let us run this.

218
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,250
So you can check here.

219
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,450
It's running for me.

220
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,840
So it's given me the running condition.

221
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,260
So it will take time to build and do everything but hope our code is correct.

222
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:46,870
Otherwise we will be buggered in a short way and we will check what things are errors or what are the

223
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,680
errors in this.

224
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,730
But I guess our code is perfectly fine.

225
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,530
It's passing everything.

226
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:02,530
The beautiful thing of Java X-Wing is you should not be mentioned any Java fixings, which is basically

227
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,750
VM options or anything.

228
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:11,080
It will load directly in your console only, which is very similar to the you can check here.

229
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,570
It's my running and you can check here.

230
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,510
My code is started or this is my ballgame.

231
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,120
So as you can see, I mentioned no resizable.

232
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,270
So as you can check here.

233
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:33,250
My these things are remaining, but my ball is not moving, so let us debug it.

234
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,610
I guess we made error in our for loop so we will check it.

235
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,510
But you can check here.

236
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,420
My these things are working and this is not going to the this part and this is remaining to this part.

237
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,830
So you can check here.

238
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,230
It's not moving like a portion downwards.

239
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,390
It just moving from here to there.

240
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,990
If I close this, it's going to me finish code with this.

241
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,400
So now it's working.

242
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,570
But we made some errors in for loop, so first we will debug it.

243
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,500
Okay.

244
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,980
I found one error in this, which is very common error.

245
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,960
I started this for loop here, which is basically my for loop.

246
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,020
And before I change.

247
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:26,860
No, but before that, I'm closing it in earlier, which is basically I'm moving it upwards with this

248
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,990
for so practically this for loop is going out of this.

249
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,030
So it's not going to move at all.

250
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,220
That's obvious thing.

251
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:44,350
So do one thing here is just move this below this map, which is basically and now let us run it again.

252
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,160
Let us check whether it's working or not.

253
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,740
So window appears.

254
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,580
And if I press this now, you can check my ball is moving and it's going to bounce at these boundaries.

255
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:04,880
Also you can check and my these things are also reappearing while recording this you can check there

256
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,140
is some lag due to some system configuration or otherwise.

257
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,580
It's moving very fine.

258
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,020
And you can check here.

259
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,580
It's giving me this.

260
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,630
And you can check if it goes down, it is going to down.

261
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,290
If I press enter again, it will create me another map.

262
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,050
Another map means a new map.

263
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,620
Now it's bounced to the right part.

264
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,700
You can check.

265
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,010
This is going right.

266
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,360
This is going left because I mentioned it's this slip.

267
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,110
So if it hits this position at this part, so it will go to.

268
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,570
Right.

269
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,400
So now it's moving to the right.

270
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,180
Now you can check this.

271
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,570
So it's working very fine.

272
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,020
Work.

273
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,660
All is working very successfully.

274
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,000
So now it's moving in that way only.

275
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,070
And our code is working fine now.

276
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,960
It's very critical condition to bring that game.

277
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:20,590
And as you can see, my squad is 85 and you can press enter it again to resume from that, but hope

278
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,170
you understand the exit for the breakout ball.

279
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:32,020
So now what you can do in this is, as I'm creating from the scratch that exposition, my position,

280
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:38,020
what you can do, you can create some illustrations here and you can add it directly as I'm creating

281
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,160
here a single player game.

282
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,340
You can create your multiplayer games.

283
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,000
Also, you can create animation, you can add sound also in this game.

284
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,160
Hope you understand.

285
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,970
Thank you.

286
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,760
So this is a very basic game I created to learn how the RW teachings works here.

287
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,210
And what is the basic mechanism of RW.

288
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,250
Hope you understand.

289
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,000
Thank you.
