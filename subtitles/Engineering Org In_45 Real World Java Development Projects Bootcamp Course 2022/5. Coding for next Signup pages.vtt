00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.450
So in this video we will be talking about the second page of the application form and the third page

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.560
of the application form.

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.490
Those classes are sign up to join Java and sign up today dot Java.

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.330
So the sign up to the Java class has been defined inside the package bank and in this class we have

5
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:28.090
imported Java .8. asterisk package eight dot event package Java X dot Spring package our dot SQL package.

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.900
So these package B are imported for to access their methods.

7
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.410
Now we have defined our sign up to sign up to class, which is extending frame and implementing actions.

8
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.540
There are 13 labels instances, one button and four radio buttons, three text fields, five combo boxes

9
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.850
and a string named as form number.

10
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.550
Then we have defined the construct parameter as constructor for the sign up to class, which is taking

11
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.810
a string form number.

12
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.640
Then we have added an image with the help of label and image icon objects and then set the label bound

13
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.770
whose location will be 150, comma zero and size will be 100 cross hundred adding that label to our

14
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.350
frame.

15
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.760
After that, we have initialized the current form number, a string instance to the past from number

16
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.420
and string.

17
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.030
And after that we have set the title as new account application form page number two.

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.430
As we have discussed in the previous video, the first sign of file, which will be the application

19
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.510
form number, page one.

20
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.090
This will be the application form number, page two.

21
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.490
So here there is a label one.

22
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.280
Page two additional details setting its font size 22 font type bold and font family as well.

23
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.820
Then there is another label as religion.

24
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:54.280
Its setting its font size as a 18 font type as the railway and font font families railway and font type

25
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.910
is bold.

26
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.980
Similarly, this font size will be applicable to all the all these labels like label three, which is

27
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.460
category have the same font properties.

28
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.150
And similarly there is an income label which also have the similar font properties.

29
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.280
Then there is the educational label qualification label, occupation label and label for the number

30
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.030
or the number label for the senior citizen.

31
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.810
Any existing account label for the form number?

32
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.880
And then there is a label which will be storing the form number.

33
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.330
So this is the form number, which is a string.

34
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.930
So this is stored the form number.

35
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.430
This will show the form number and its font type, font type of this label form number and form number

36
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.310
is 13, size is 13.

37
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.760
And then there is a button next which will move us to take us to the third application form page.

38
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.760
Then we have sent the font for that button.

39
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.350
Its font family is railway, font type is bold and font size is 14.

40
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.970
After that, there is a background color as black and foreground color as white.

41
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.940
Then we have there are the text fields defined for that respect to label.

42
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.690
So there are.

43
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.640
Text field even we have defined its font properties after that for the respective text field.

44
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.340
We have defined its properties.

45
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.160
Those are similar to the above labels.

46
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.530
Then we have defined the radio button.

47
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.490
Yes, that's for the senior citizens.

48
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.680
Button setting its font and background color.

49
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.280
After that, we have defined the radio button.

50
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.630
No, that's also for the Senior Citizen Railway or that's its setting, its fonts and background color.

51
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.660
Similarly, there is a railway button for yes and no.

52
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.730
These railway radio buttons are for existing account purpose.

53
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.940
Or is there any account the customer have already in the account, bank account or not?

54
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.180
Similarly, there is a string of religion we have created Hindu, Muslim, sick, Christian or any other

55
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.760
religion.

56
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.380
Then we have added or pastor that a string of named as religion into our combo box then set the background

57
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.970
colour as white and its font.

58
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.070
Similarly, there is a string category.

59
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:21.120
Installing General OBC assist and other passing that category area of a string to our C to combo box.

60
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.830
Setting its background colour and font properties.

61
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:33.350
Then there is a string income, so income will store null less than 1.5 lakh, 2.5 lakh 510 lakh and

62
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.910
about ten lakh passing that string of income to our combo box, setting its background, colour and

63
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.530
font properties.

64
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.570
After that, similarly for the education, we will have a string like non graduate graduate, postgraduate

65
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.490
doctorate and others passing that education is string to add it to our combo work setting as background

66
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.630
colour and foreground colour.

67
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.690
After that we have a string occupation, salaried, self employed, business student, retired or others

68
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.880
passing that total combo box, background colour and four font properties for that combo box setting

69
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.170
the layout as null.

70
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.010
After that, what we did is set the location and size for all the labels.

71
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:16.850
So this is for the L1 to label L1 three, label L1 L2 C one that will be combo box l3c2l43, three,

72
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.980
five, c four and l11.

73
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.090
After that four.

74
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.690
L six.

75
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.470
C five.

76
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.860
We have set the bond and size.

77
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.660
Similarly, after that, we have set for the EL 71 EL 82 line or one or two.

78
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.470
Then similarly for the L 110 R three or four and for the button as well.

79
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.460
After that, we have added action.

80
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.540
Listen to the button and decide the background colour of the complete frame as white.

81
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:52.010
Then we have set the size as 850 cross, 750 of the frame and location has 500 comma 120.

82
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.860
After that, we have set the visibility of the window as true.

83
00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:02.690
Then we have we have defined the action performed method which is taking action event inside the string

84
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.540
religion category, income, education and occupation.

85
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.030
We have selected the items from the combo box and type casted them to the strings respectively.

86
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.370
Then we have installed bankcard and other card detail in a string band and other.

87
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.640
And for the citizen senior citizen a string.

88
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.550
We will check if the radio button one is selected.

89
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.910
Then we will store yes in senior citizen a string.

90
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.190
Otherwise we will store knowing senior citizen.

91
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.600
Similarly, for the existing account, if our three selected, we will store.

92
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.900
Yes.

93
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.490
If our four is selected, we will store.

94
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.940
No.

95
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.200
So inside the log what we did at two textures equals two null.

96
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.270
So that fill all the required details.

97
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:49.330
As we will go on seven point neocon so a string into this will q one will create a string a string insight

98
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.890
into sign two values.

99
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:58.060
These will contain all the required values, and for that inserting into our table seven notice is not

100
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.980
executable that very will execute the query and update values in our table.

101
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.490
After that, we will move the control of the program to the sign up three passing that current form

102
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.440
number and set the visibility as true and set the visibility of current window as false cache block

103
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.440
will handle any exception if occurs and instead the main function.

104
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.330
We have defined the current instance of sign up with the null string value and set the results to large.

105
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.830
Let's move to the last application form base that is sign up three dot Java.

106
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.240
This is defined inside the package bank.

107
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.770
We have imported the necessary package here also.

108
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.770
After that we have defined the class, which is extending frame and extension.

109
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.920
There is also 12 labels for radio buttons, two buttons and seven checkboxes.

110
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.390
A string number, form number.

111
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.530
Then we have defined the parameterized constructor and initialize the current instance of our number

112
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.930
to the past instance, past the string form number.

113
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.280
After that, we have said the title as new account application form page three.

114
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:55.390
Then we have added the image and it's added the image to the label and added that label to our frame.

115
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.070
Similarly, we have defined label here.

116
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.420
That is a page three account details settings font properties, account type font properties, card

117
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.720
number.

118
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:08.350
It's from properties and there is another label as showing the format of the card number.

119
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.590
It's setting its font again.

120
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.870
Now use exchange is in card number label and setting its font.

121
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:19.280
Then it would appear on the ATM card, checkbook and bank statement label, setting its font pin for

122
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:25.000
setting its font, another label as which will show the format for the pin, setting its fonts.

123
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.950
Then four digit password setting its font.

124
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.800
After that there is a service required setting its font form number for its font properties.

125
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:39.320
Then for another label which will be storing the form number and setting its font properties, then

126
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.650
there is a button submit setting its font properties, background and foreground colour.

127
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.670
After that there is a button cancel setting its font properties, background and foreground color.

128
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:55.490
Then there is a checkbox save an ATM card, another checkbox for internet banking setting its background,

129
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.200
color and font type properties.

130
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:03.320
Similarly, for the mobile banking checkbox email alert checkbox checkbox, checkbox e statement checkbox

131
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.560
and then there is a checkbox for declaration.

132
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.000
I hereby declares that I will enter details correct to the best of my knowledge.

133
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.710
And after that.

134
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:15.700
Uh.

135
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.870
We have radio buttons, saving account setting, it's fonts and background colour.

136
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.730
Then there is a radio button fixed deposit account setting its font and background color.

137
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:32.030
Then there is a ready button for current account font and background color and recurring deposit account

138
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.530
font background color.

139
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:41.060
Then we have a group to those radio buttons with the help of button group instance group group gender

140
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.320
and added.

141
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.620
All these buttons are one are to have three and four into that.

142
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.900
Then we have set the layout as null.

143
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:55.280
After that, what we have did is is scaled the position and size for all the labels, text field radio

144
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.110
buttons and required fields.

145
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.600
So combo box checkboxes.

146
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.530
We have set their position with the help of said bounce method.

147
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.570
After that, what we did here is get content paint, set background color as white.

148
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.260
So this will set the background color of the complete window file white.

149
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.810
Then set the size as 850, close 850.

150
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.800
Then set location as 500, cross 120 and visibility as true.

151
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.560
Then we have added action as needed both of the buttons.

152
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.460
B1 and be to.

153
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.850
After that inside the action perform the event which is taking action event object it string a type

154
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.230
is equal account type is also null.

155
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.630
So if our run selected we will store saving account.

156
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.190
If are two then fixed up our deposit account if our three current account if our for recurring deposit

157
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.640
account.

158
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:44.180
Similarly for the random, we have randomized our number for seven which and inside the card number

159
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.520
we will install the first seven digits.

160
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.210
Of this variable, which will have the first seven digits for the car number and for the first three

161
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:58.700
digits for the PIN number, we will store in the string pin and then a string facility.

162
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:04.800
If the seven is selected, we will add inside the facility, we will add ATM card, Internet banking

163
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.280
too.

164
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.960
So those are the facilities which will be selected.

165
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.840
All of these will be added inside the facility string with these if statements inside the drive log.

166
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.670
What we have done is if the source of the button is from V1, then we will check if a account type is

167
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.630
equals to null.

168
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.650
Then we will show that.

169
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.120
Fill all the required details.

170
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.070
So after that, if we will create the connection and execute two queries.

171
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:35.840
So first we need to insert the data in the sign up tree table and as well as we will be inserting data

172
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.700
in our login table which will contain form number, card number and pin as card number and pin will

173
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.990
be generated randomly.

174
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.980
So we will execute both of the queries installed in a string.

175
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.030
Q1 and Q2.

176
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:52.850
And so the dialog box that the card number and pin has been generated, then we will move to our new

177
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:53.780
deposit pin.

178
00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:01.840
Her class and said the visibility as to if the source of the button is from B2, then we will system

179
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.110
dot exit close so the complete program will be closed.

180
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:10.580
Now inside the public static wide menu string areas, we will be calling new sign up tree with null

181
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.510
values and set the visibility as true.

182
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:19.690
So this is all about the application form classes which are signed up one sign up, sign up to and sign

183
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.170
up three.

184
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.150
There will be three pages in the application form and we have talked about all these classes which are

185
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.740
creating these three pages.

186
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.180
So that's all in this video.
