1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,610
So in this part, we are going to create a currency converter using the Yahoo API.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,920
So here we will go to the file menu and create our new project.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,760
We made this converter.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,560
Be.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:28,860
And this source package will create a new freeform animators converter.

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,640
Now we will need to do a part here,

7
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,190
a panel here.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:55,700
And now we will take a nibble here and you test this one here.

9
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,790
This will be the amount that you want to convert from.

10
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,430
It will ask and go to the editor and write in the amount.

11
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,580
And now we need a text field.

12
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:21,930
The Sun.

13
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,980
It's clear.

14
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,780
It will change to variable name

15
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,770
currency amount.

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,340
To make it some bigger.

17
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,210
Now we need to have the list for the currency fund.

18
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,940
So let's just this one here.

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
And it this currency from.

20
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,150
Another label to ask the currency to.

21
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,290
Currency to.

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,530
Can you guarantee from?

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,370
But one good got to know.

24
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,680
Now we will select where the list will be stored.

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,490
So.

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,880
So gonna scroll?

27
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,320
No.

28
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,060
We can take combo box here.

29
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,870
This one.

30
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,870
Simply put it to this duplicate.

31
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,480
We said it here.

32
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,180
No Google properties here.

33
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,770
Okay.

34
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,030
These days.

35
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,370
We have this one box of these.

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,660
And go do it.

37
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,330
And here you will set up a list.

38
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,530
I already have my list here.

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,960
Simply copy this.

40
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,540
Simply paste this list here.

41
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,290
This is done.

42
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,330
Same thing with this.

43
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,050
Born and raised here we have a list here.

44
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,810
We simply run this first.

45
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,710
Let me close.

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,170
So here we have a to basically.

47
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,510
Doing on our streets, which we have selected from this list.

48
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,340
The

49
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,320
same goes with this.

50
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,330
Who cares what we have done with that part?

51
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,160
Do we have a precise first?

52
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,700
So basically this is the list.

53
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,220
So here we have this kind of called the variable name.

54
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,080
And we.

55
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,280
Mm.

56
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,850
Couldn't see from.

57
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,720
And this will minimize the currency to.

58
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,490
This will be the currency to hear.

59
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:33,760
No.

60
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,850
We need to tenure.

61
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,560
This will really convert.

62
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,050
Change the variable name, then convert.

63
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,820
Listen, we didn't convert.

64
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:08,600
Now we need a label who basically have the value of the conversion.

65
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,690
So

66
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,830
we will put this on.

67
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,090
Teens already will need to

68
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,140
display.

69
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:39,990
Okay.

70
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,400
So it's done.

71
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,490
No.

72
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,250
We need to function this button first.

73
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,300
We will go to this button.

74
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,010
Convert action form.

75
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,500
We will write the code.

76
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,480
First it takes us a step to collect the actual values.

77
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,620
So basically let's have.

78
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,690
Let's get the amount first.

79
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,300
So will write

80
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,070
the amount first.

81
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,950
To convert.

82
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,540
So to take string.

83
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,380
Quoting the text.

84
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,010
So

85
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,300
to write.

86
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,680
Couldn't see a moon or get texture.

87
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,960
The sun.

88
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,260
No check for numbers only.

89
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,800
Another step we will take to check that it's number or not.

90
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,830
So check the numbers here.

91
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:26,960
So we will take the for loop here so I can do zero.

92
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,070
And I is less than.

93
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:42,800
Good is the amount text not length plus plus.

94
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,430
Not this for loop.

95
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,690
It check character is a digit.

96
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,210
So here we will write if.

97
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,810
I do not

98
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,340
institute.

99
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,730
So here, if it is not there, it's probably a number.

100
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,060
So you will try the currency amount?

101
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,090
Not.

102
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,490
Got at this one.

103
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,410
So we need a text box to convert.

104
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,740
So we need a dialogue to.

105
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,330
G option.

106
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,230
I'm sure.

107
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,920
Message.

108
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,700
Dialogue.

109
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,160
We need a message dialogue here.

110
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,100
Who need this.

111
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,240
In the evening will be

112
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,870
what we will write, please, and a valid amount.

113
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,290
First, we need to focus, of course.

114
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,180
So we will write.

115
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,470
Good into your mind.

116
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,550
Now I request focus.

117
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,410
Moonshine.

118
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,760
Okay.

119
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,080
Who we have in this part.

120
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:49,150
After this, we will set the focus and then return first.

121
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,120
This will be a.

122
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,910
And this will be written over text first and then now includes.

123
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,010
We have the text.

124
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,970
Let's see.

125
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,950
Reset the display result.

126
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:31,200
So after this, we will write this display, not text.

127
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:43,120
Get currency from the get currency to.

128
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,030
We will take.

129
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,710
We will leave a string.

130
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,670
Here we have the string.

131
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,710
So here we will write.

132
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,610
We need.

133
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,490
Careened from text.

134
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:21,650
We need a good and strong law to get selected text.

135
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:32,250
The third value would not speak to the value.

136
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,160
It slipped her index or the item first and then to string.

137
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,660
And after this we need the same thing.

138
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,650
But according to text here

139
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:16,080
Gooding, do not get select selected items not to strip.

140
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:22,890
Basically we get the selected value and the two string converts to the string.

141
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,600
So.

142
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,320
Who would we have done this thing?

143
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,000
I know.

144
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,530
So before we have now here's the thing.

145
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:47,960
The way current text is designed, this one, it saves you if it saves you an.

146
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,090
We get the actual code from the value, you will just say string area.

147
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,420
So what we need is a string array.

148
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,210
Mm.

149
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,990
And we know

150
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:19,010
that we need current phone banks and we need a split.

151
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,590
Hmm.

152
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,950
Could we get this?

153
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,310
Semicolon.

154
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,900
Basically, we need.

155
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,650
Trying.

156
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,560
Wouldn't.

157
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:53,310
We need I think we need a current from tax to.

158
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,790
So we are split that we need.

159
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,760
Going from title here.

160
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,750
So we'll go right from title

161
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,460
to this part.

162
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,230
After this.

163
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,110
We need string.

164
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:54,330
So we would have attempted this rule rewrite.

165
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,240
Current text.

166
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:07,650
No.

167
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,570
We need a current to text into text.

168
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,380
We need a current string

169
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,700
theory to.

170
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:40,480
We need new according to texture and set it to the temp zero position here.

171
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:53,710
And after this we need another string going to cool and set it to one position here.

172
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,210
So here we have done this on a temporary one.

173
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,310
