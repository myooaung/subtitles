1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,950
You know, in the previous thing I told you, we created one client trade, which is exchange trade.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,550
I mistake that in first part is we closed that server or class of only.

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,210
So the this class client should inside only that server class.

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,860
Otherwise it will not run.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,120
So for that purpose I'm going to using inside only that server class.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,520
Now we are created already this constructor.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,080
Now we are remaining with some methods which is basically that get input each and everything, as I

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,960
told you earlier.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:46,050
So first, create a one input or or we can say we can create a one method which is get username for

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,430
getting the username.

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,570
Inside our.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,440
Client.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,320
So let me create one public void.

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,530
Get.

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,330
User.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,390
Name.

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,810
Which is basically.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,470
Returning.

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,800
Username.

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,520
So.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,760
Why it should be string.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,860
Let me tell you, it is returning as a string.

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,060
So it should be string.

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,470
It's not returning void or anything.

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,650
Now I need to set the username.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,810
Similar method public.

27
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,040
Now it's it should be void set username.

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,780
Again this.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,490
So let me check first.

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,930
If I use this set username e anywhere.

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,920
No.

32
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,650
So said username is a first time part.

33
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,180
So you need to require.

34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,840
I told you because.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,090
Or this is very what we can say sometimes this is very huge code.

36
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:23,880
Sometimes you miss checkers those some part or you know writing or you can say uppercase lowercase.

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,710
So always remember you should.

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,560
Go with that part.

39
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,010
So this is using the set username to the username.

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,410
So this is done.

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,770
So this is for the setting, the username and all the things.

42
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,380
So what I'm creating here, I need to create an infinite loop.

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,200
Let me write in finite.

44
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,010
New to read and forward message.

45
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:02,260
So what it's actually going to do, it is storing in the as object that message inside our client we

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:10,870
can say and or we can say edit class released and what it will be do it will print that in a broadcast

47
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,230
we.

48
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,710
So I knew the void meant for public void.

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,480
Run run is basically for the running that.

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,360
Third, as you can see here, we got this one symbol here.

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,860
So what is this thing?

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,960
Is it is executing the trade class.

53
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,380
And you can see target run.

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,220
It is overriding all of this.

55
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,840
Never change that.

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,320
But I'm telling you that before libraries.

57
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,320
Who knew until logout.

58
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,100
So what I'm going to do is William, you know, keep going.

59
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,870
I created already.

60
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,100
Bullion keep going is equal to.

61
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,400
Through.

62
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,900
They'll keep going.

63
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,010
I need to mention the reading part.

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,840
So.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,260
Read.

66
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,130
String.

67
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,600
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to read that string.

68
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,730
So what the things we required here is very similar.

69
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,610
I need to create a blog.

70
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,940
I will tell you what is going to do is I will introduce these chat messages and chat messages.

71
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,880
Another class and this class.

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,670
And it will go to that input and each and every time.

73
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,690
So as I mentioned this, we need to clear this now.

74
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,810
What is remaining class?

75
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,900
Not found thing here.

76
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:55,110
So I am mentioning what we can say will specify the carriage block for our exception different class

77
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,620
not found exception different because there is very important part here.

78
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,770
If you are mentioning exception, it will print all the exceptions.

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,960
But for our client user interface purpose, I'm using this.

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,810
Then.

81
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,530
I'm going to get the message.

82
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,530
I should get that message from that part.

83
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,950
So what I'm going to do is I'm mentioning this part also.

84
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,960
So I will tell you where I'm going to create this great message in the chat message and each and everything.

85
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:32,050
So what I need to do is I need to get a different action based on the type of that messages, as I told

86
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:39,970
you, or if that username part is different and each and everything, I can create a switch case here.

87
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,850
So I will explain the switch case first year.

88
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,310
Often this.

89
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,370
I will mention this.

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,700
Okay.

91
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,070
Now, what are these things?

92
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:58,980
After this chat message, I'm going to ask switch get type, which is basically in the chat message.

93
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,390
Chat message is a message which some broadcast it will.

94
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,370
What will you repeat?

95
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,020
The username and the message.

96
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,070
And what is the confirmation to you?

97
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,430
The confirmation is blocked.

98
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,960
No such use exist.

99
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,120
So what is this part, actually?

100
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,830
As I told you.

101
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:30,600
While I'm asking if I check for that eldritch symbol here I direct John, it will go to that private

102
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,760
research part for search purposes.

103
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,840
What I'm going to do, I'm creating here that broadcast part here.

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,170
So you can see I can say that what if I'm printing logout from the user?

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,230
It will be disconnected for the who is in metered.

106
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,260
It will print all username since that date part.

107
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,320
So this is all about things.

108
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,340
How we can create.

109
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,760
So I need to create.

110
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,940
If you're out of the loop or disconnected, I need to remove that ID and etcetera.

111
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,180
Things I need to mention here.

112
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,680
Then it will be asked me for all gender.

113
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,660
Okay.

114
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,530
So this is how we can create this part.

115
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,240
So.

116
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,240
Let me do two or three things here first as I created here using method.
