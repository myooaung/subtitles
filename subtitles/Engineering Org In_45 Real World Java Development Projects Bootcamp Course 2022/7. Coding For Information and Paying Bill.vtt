WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.320
So here is our Web information dot Java file.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:12.390
So first, this Java file is inside the package electricity.

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.010
And we have imported the necessary.

4
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.800
Packages.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.290
Swing and data, beauty and skill.

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.720
And now we have defined the way of information class, which is extending frame and implementing action

7
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.190
listener.

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.380
Here is only one button, the GIA button type.

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.430
That is a V1 now where information constructor is a parameterized constructor taking a string type of

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.460
variable that is a meter setting the bound for the window and setting the background color of the window

11
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.860
that is a white and the layout has null.

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.010
Then there is a label as title that is a label or named as we have custom information setting the bounds

13
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.900
for the title and.

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.950
Her setting font for the title font, family font type and font size, then adding the title in our

15
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.760
frame.

16
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.300
After that, there is a label element that is a new label for name and it's a respect to label one,

17
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.740
one that will be fetched.

18
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.690
Information will be shown in this label by fetching from the database.

19
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.430
So we have set the bounds for those labels and added those labels in our frame or window.

20
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.320
Then we have label L two and l12 that labels are a meter number named as label meter number, setting

21
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:41.770
the bound for that and adding l two to our frame, then its respective l12 that will fetch the information

22
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.470
from the database and L1 to setting bounds for that and adding L1 to our frame.

23
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.300
Similarly, for the L three that will work for the address and its respective l13 then for the L four

24
00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.900
that work as setting and adding those labels to our j frame or window.

25
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.510
Similarly, for the L five field for a state and its respective l15 will fetch information from the

26
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.630
database similarly for the email as well.

27
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.180
Now after that, L seven will work for phone number as well of the customer.

28
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.650
So these are the labels which we will add and set the bounds for that and add that, add those to our

29
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.730
frame or window.

30
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.150
Now inside right block, we have established the connection of by using our coupon class and here's

31
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.140
the results set.

32
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.790
Type of variable RS which is used to execute the query select aspect from customer number is also meter.

33
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.320
So the meter number for which the information we want admin wants to show or will show he or she admin

34
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.670
will enter the meter number.

35
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.570
And with respect to that meter number, the details of the customer will be provided now for asked next.

36
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:03.060
So result query on the basis of result query the next row of that in the database or in the table customer.

37
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.950
The details will be fetched and stored in the respective labels of this window, as we discussed above.

38
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:20.820
So l11 will have get a string one which will contain meter number two will contain name and respectively.

39
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.410
Name, meter number, address, city, state email and phone number will be stored in these labels.

40
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.520
Catch.

41
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.420
Catch will catch.

42
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.340
Ziploc will handle any exception focus.

43
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.130
Then there is a be button, which is a back button labeled as back set as foreground background color

44
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.320
as back for round color as white, setting the bound for the button, adding its accent listener, and

45
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.780
adding the button to the frame, then adding an image to a new label.

46
00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.980
That is an image I can image is a view customer dot jpg inside the icon folder, adding the label late

47
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.590
with the icon and setting the bound for the label and adding that label to our frame or window.

48
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.580
Then there is the action performed method which is defined this set visible as false so as there is

49
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.180
a one button.

50
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.460
So on event of that button that is a back button.

51
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.620
So this window will be closed and set as visibility as false inside.

52
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.420
Then we have defined the main method with the.

53
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.880
Instance of the information class with nulla nulla string argument and sentence visibility to two.

54
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.690
Let's move to the Babel section of this Babel or Java file, which is defined inside the package.

55
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.470
Electricity.

56
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.010
Necessary file packages are imported.

57
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.010
Then the class is defined as Babel extending frame and implementing action listener.

58
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.240
The labels are six labels and their respective five merge labels.

59
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.360
J Text Field one text field two choices, two buttons and a string type of meta variable passing that

60
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.980
is string type of meta variable to.

61
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.120
Passing that type of metered variable to the parameterized constructor, setting the layout as null.

62
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.430
Setting the bound for the window j table electricity bill named as electricity bill that is a label

63
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.560
setting font for the label and bound for the label, adding the title label to our frame or window.

64
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.270
Now similarly here, meet the number and its respective data which will be labeled which will be fetched

65
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.880
from the database is created it's bonds and added to the project.

66
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.190
Here this will be for name and this will be for month.

67
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.080
Now, for month there will be choice.

68
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.870
So here choice will be defined as the 12 months and add it to our frame with its bounds as well.

69
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.290
Now the Alpha is a new label for the units.

70
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.610
Here it is a units.

71
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.190
Alpha for the units.

72
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.170
And it's expected it will fetch data from the database l5 that is a total bill.

73
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.250
It's boundaries set added to the project and respect to g label whose boundaries has been set and added

74
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.700
to the.

75
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.420
For window now.

76
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.730
l6l6 is a j legal status.

77
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.010
Its bounce has been set and added to our.

78
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.540
J frame or window.

79
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.700
Then the one five whose foreground color is set as red and added to a window.

80
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.260
Now inside try block.

81
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.850
We have first establish the connection result set which is selecting abstract from the customer where

82
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.020
MOS metre is equal to meter.

83
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.680
So on the basis of meter number, this will fetch the data from the database result next with iterate

84
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.040
over the rows of that information which will be fetched.

85
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.890
So L1 one will store the meter name, meter number and logo and will store the name.

86
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.120
Now see this.

87
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.510
This statement will fetch the bill from.

88
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.880
The build table of the database on the basis of meter number and month month is defined here January

89
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.020
and.

90
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:21.330
He rate over the record and a store unit's total bill and status on the respective labels.

91
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.630
L1 three, L1 four and L1 five.

92
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.420
Cas the exception, if any, occurs then C1 ad is now in C1.

93
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.300
That is a choice type of variable.

94
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.460
We have added an item that's not on the item state change if the item is changed from the default.

95
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.750
So we will establish the connection and we have a result set.

96
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.580
We're meeting on the basis of meter number and the month which is being selected.

97
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.460
If it is being selected or changed from the default, it's heading over those record and storing again.

98
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:01.670
Consequently the one, three, one, four and one five for the units total bill and the status respectively.

99
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.110
Getting the exception if any occurs then we will have a button for pay.

100
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.050
Setting the bond on the button, adding the button a button back, setting the bound for the button,

101
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:17.300
adding the button background color as black foreground color as white for the B1.

102
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:23.360
Similarly, for the B2 button as well, setting the image icon using a label l21 setting the bound for

103
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.970
L to one and a negative to one to a frame.

104
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:33.230
Adding accent listener to the B1 and B2 buttons setting the background color of the get pane or the

105
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.020
frame or window window which will want to use as white.

106
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:42.560
Now defining the public void action performed, which will take argument as action event so that if

107
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.140
the source of the action event object is B1.

108
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:55.150
Then we will perform a connection, establish and update the status, and we will update the status

109
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.890
to paid, which we will.

110
00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:04.090
We have previously stated our fixed as not paid when we have generated the bill in a generate build

111
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:04.960
or Java class.

112
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:13.410
So now in catch block we will catch the exception if any court and this starts set as well is it goes

113
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:21.690
to fall so if the if the bill has been passed so this paid so that this window will be closed and new

114
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.980
patent bill window will be called, which will be just going to discuss after that.

115
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:34.300
And else if if the blue button is performed for the event, then this window will be closed and sets

116
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.170
visibility as the false inside the main method.

117
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:44.620
Its current class object has been created and setting is visibility to pro now move to the Paytm dot

118
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.420
java file.

119
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.890
It is also defined inside the electricity package, importing the necessary files.

120
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.740
And packages and defining the class, which is extending a frame and exhalation of a string type of

121
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.890
meter variable and ab1g button type of b1.

122
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.070
So first is PTM, which is the constructor parameter constructor taking a string type of meter.

123
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.280
Setting that instance variable meter to the meter value passed.

124
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:19.130
And here is a DJ editor being created ed pane j set eligible it is fixed to so that set editable property

125
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.340
has been set to false so that it cannot be edited.

126
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:30.260
But when it goes to a new button that is a back button whose color is black and for color is white bound

127
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:36.440
bounds for the button adding action listener to the button and adding that button to the J editor pane.

128
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:44.600
Now try inside triangle as we have set the page in of the editor pane to the Paytm link.

129
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.150
Now inside the catch frame link doesn't work, then the catch block will handle the exception.

130
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:59.420
Now we have added a scroll panel by setting the close operations of the exit on close, getting the

131
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:05.840
content pane and adding the scroll pane on the frame window, setting the preferred size and set the

132
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.120
size for the window and setting the location of the window and setting the visibility of the window.

133
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.180
Now wide action performed inside action performed.

134
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.170
It will take action event as a parameter.

135
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.580
So this dot set visibility equals to false as there is only one button on the.

136
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.460
He went on that button.

137
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:32.040
So this window will be closed if the bag button has been pressed and the new payable meter.

138
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.520
So it will take you back if you press back.

139
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.460
So it will take you back to the PayPal section of the.

140
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.470
People window and close the window.

141
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.230
So that's why people.

142
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.610
Or meter and set visibility has been set to.

143
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.000
Now inside the main function.

144
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.070
New Palladium method.

145
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:59.990
A new Palladium object has been created with mm nulla string of estimated value and set with visibility

146
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.410
as true.

147
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.250
So these are the three classes which we have discussed in this video.

148
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.120
We will talk about the remaining three classes in the next video.
