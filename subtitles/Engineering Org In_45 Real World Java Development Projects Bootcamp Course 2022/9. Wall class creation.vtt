1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.930
So here, this is the world class.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.420
It inherits from actor class.

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.980
So here I will write expense actor.

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:19.190
And now upon the construction it loads a wall image from the resources part.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.950
So simply I will write private IMG.

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.760
Impeach.

7
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:38.130
And now we need a public constructor here to take in X comma into coordinate.

8
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:49.870
Under that, we will call this super the parent class of the one which is the actor actors, the parent

9
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.220
class.

10
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.660
So here I will take x, comma, y.

11
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.160
Now we need to create initial word material.

12
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.120
Ritual mainly take the images from their source.

13
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.030
So my initial one here and here I will write.

14
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.470
Image icon icon equal to new image icon.

15
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:40.540
And here I will give the part i sa c slash resources slash one dot png and next thing I image equal

16
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.250
to I can not get the image here and set the image.

17
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.690
With the I image tag.

18
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.770
And so this is what we have created.

19
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.630
This will be the glacier.

20
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.950
It will inherit from that cloth upon the construction.

21
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.370
It will lose a wall image from the resources here.
