00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.040
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:10.470
So I hope you all have went through the introduction of the project video very well and must be willing

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.640
to start making the project.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.040
So first let me show you the working of the game and how it works, how the obstacles are handled,

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.510
how the snake is being moved and everything about the project before going to start to make it so.

6
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:37.300
Starting the project and show you how it works to make it more interesting and make you more eager to

7
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.020
make it.

8
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.960
So the project is running.

9
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.640
Yes.

10
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.920
The execution is being made and you will see a screen.

11
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.960
Yes.

12
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.800
Perfect.

13
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.390
So now let's start to.

14
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.820
Read The Snake, which in the project is about.

15
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.870
So the dots are increasing, you can see.

16
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.480
Bill is being added to the snake body and.

17
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630
It's such an interesting game.

18
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.150
No.

19
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.320
Yes.

20
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.200
The snake is getting larger and larger.

21
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.510
Eating the apple.

22
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.930
So the project is made using Java JWT and there is a frame inside which the snake is moving.

23
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.080
Or we can say that eating the apple he must be enjoying.

24
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.490
So the snake is growing.

25
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.440
And the project is.

26
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.160
So amazing.

27
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.990
I hope so.

28
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.330
You must be thinking the same.

29
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:07.100
So, yes, the snake is quite large enough, so let us see a more fact about this leg.

30
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.590
Suppose.

31
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.180
Yes.

32
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.990
So the snake hits the wall.

33
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.280
You must have seen.

34
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.330
So when the snake hits the wall or any obstacle, the pop up will appear, showing that the game is

35
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.900
over.

36
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.120
Like, similarly, if I run the project again and try to hit the snake itself, you will see the same

37
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.780
result.

38
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.430
Snakes oppose growing the snake first so that it can hit its own self.

39
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.190
So.

40
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.440
So, yes.

41
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.160
Now, let's try to hit Disney with itself.

42
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.520
I think it's short enough and notable.

43
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.990
Yes.

44
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.090
So that snake hits itself and the game is over again.

45
00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:02.230
So there are three obstacles as the walls, the window frame and the snake itself.

46
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.110
So in the meantime, of feeding the snake, you must have observed, what are the game over scenes in

47
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.800
that game?

48
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.200
And what should be avoided so that the snake can grow longer?

49
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.530
So there is a frame.

50
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.090
You can see that.

51
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.550
And the frame has some size.

52
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.460
Like suppose there are 300 points this 300 point this.

53
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.500
Like we have a whole desktop screen.

54
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.440
So you have to set this frame and we cannot increase the frame.

55
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.480
As if we increase the frame, it will be difficult to set the game of our constraints in the programme.

56
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.190
So we have to set country constraints according to the size of the frame.

57
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.150
Like if the coordinate is going to be zero zero here, suppose this is zero zero.

58
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.650
So if the snake hits this point, the game will be over.

59
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.990
And parallel to the same line here, a few coordinates away.

60
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.160
If the ball is hit by snake, the game will be over again.

61
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.360
And after getting the idea about the working of the application, let us.

62
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.710
Yes.

63
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.130
So let us start.

64
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.570
Making a prototype of what is going to be done in this project, like while making this project, what

65
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.970
are the points we are going to cover?

66
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.130
So firstly.

67
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.520
We have to, of course, create a new Java project.

68
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.530
And the idea, of course.

69
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:53.930
And that can be we have to add images in the project like you have seen that the images are the main

70
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.920
concept behind like we have no real snake.

71
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.850
Of course we have images of points that are growing and Apple also is an image.

72
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.820
And like a PNG image we are adding to the project and then calling it again and again.

73
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.570
So adding images to the project is going to be the model.

74
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:26.420
When we are beginning started creating the frame should be the next concern, starting creating the

75
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.320
frame.

76
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:36.340
So it is the frame which decides that when the snake will die and well, when he will continue to grow

77
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.530
by eating the apple.

78
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.140
After that we have to place the images or we added the images.

79
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:54.560
First we started creating the frame and then we have to place the images inside the inside the frame.

80
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.240
Yes.

81
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.350
So suppose we have added the image, we have created the frame, we have placed the images inside the

82
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.850
frame now.

83
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:17.660
So this is the frame where we have added the image inside which we have to add the object which the

84
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.220
snake is going to it.

85
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:26.240
Now you can see that there are three dots and these three dots are three totally different images,

86
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.890
like we have two green dots which are same but added separately one by one and we have a head as the

87
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.790
red dot.

88
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.920
So in the meantime, we have to add dots, one behind each.

89
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.860
Whenever the snake eats the apple and it starts getting longer and longer.

90
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:59.060
So we have to add image like we have to place the images one behind other, one behind the other.

91
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.060
Yes.

92
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.580
So here we are.

93
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.290
We have created the frame and we have added the images.

94
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.790
We have placed the image.

95
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.720
Place, the major one behind.

96
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.910
So, yes, this is the extra part.

97
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:24.360
Now, the next motive should be location of Apple, like the apple is changing its location.

98
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:30.690
You have seen when I was playing the game once the apple was head then here and continuously changing

99
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.590
the position.

100
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.430
So we have to change the location of Apple.

101
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.770
We have to decide basically that what is going to be the location of the apple.

102
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.640
Yes.

103
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:55.150
So after fitting everything inside the frame, now we have to make the project working like every action

104
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.820
should contain a listener.

105
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:05.260
Which is that what after clicking this button, what this button should listen, and what action should

106
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.280
it perform?

107
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.660
So action.

108
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.390
Adding action listeners.

109
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.680
Yes, actually, listeners.

110
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:26.740
And after that we have to move towards implementing the keyboard events like the snake is handled with

111
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.900
the help of keyboard.

112
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.950
So implementation of keyboard events.

113
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.200
Yes.

114
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.250
So we have four keys overall, which is going to be used while playing this game.

115
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:48.400
So implementation of keyboard events is the important part, one of the important parts, while making

116
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.950
this project and afterwards, we have to handle the collision of the snake.

117
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:59.410
Like if the snake hurts itself or any of the obstacle should be handled.

118
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.530
So that collision of snake with Apple.

119
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.590
Yes, the collision with the apple is also anything like it.

120
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.600
Increase the size of the snake.

121
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.800
Of course the game is not over, but the snake grows in the size.

122
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.730
So this collision should also be taken into consideration.

123
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:26.140
So first collision after which we have to handle the collision of snake with self or with the walls.

124
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.420
So handle the collision of the snake.

125
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.220
With two wars or with itself.

126
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.580
I knitted self.

127
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.050
Yes.

128
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:53.330
So all the three collisions we have covered by far handling the collision with Apple.

129
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:53.930
Okay.

130
00:09:53.930 --> 00:10:01.640
So this is Apple handling the collision of the snake with Apple with the wall and with itself.

131
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.080
Now we have to move the points inside the frame.

132
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:15.100
Like, of course we have images, not any actual thing like which is moving inside the frame.

133
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.010
We are just moving images inside the frame.

134
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.670
So after any collision, the image is moving.

135
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:29.260
So moving one point away or one point away and all these things are going to done in Java completely.

136
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.330
So can you imagine?

137
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.860
We are moving images inside the frame with the help of Java.

138
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.480
We have no videos.

139
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.260
We are moving simple dot images inside the frame.

140
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.850
Isn't it amazing?

141
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.910
So moving the snake inside the frame.

142
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.990
This is going to be an amazing project.

143
00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:01.880
You are going to learn much, much interesting concepts after completing this.

144
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:10.490
So moving that snake inside the frame after which we are going to handle repaint the frame to discover

145
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:18.950
that changes like if the snake is all game over, hit an obstacle, or it eats the apple.

146
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.250
So we have to repaint this.

147
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.250
Like we have to change the apples position.

148
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:34.880
We have to increase the snake by one size by adding a paint to its body, and after which we are going

149
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.810
to add game over functionality.

150
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.370
So the game is over when the snake hits any of the obstacles.

151
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:53.270
So handling the game over functionality should be an important concern.

152
00:11:53.810 --> 00:12:02.870
So when the game is over, should be a function and we are going to do all of this using the Java and

153
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.280
its libraries.

154
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:12.680
After this, completing all the required processes, we are going to run the project.

155
00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.830
Yes, run the project and play the amazing game last night game.

156
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.000
So running the snake game?

157
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.510
Yes, of course.

158
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.850
Running the snake game.

159
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.900
Perfect.

160
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.530
So we have built an overall rough idea.

161
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:38.780
Basically, we have made a prototype that how we are going to design the application and how it's going

162
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.800
to be look after performing all of these.

163
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:52.670
So let's begin making this project step by step and learn the implementation of the libraries.

164
00:12:52.690 --> 00:13:00.650
Learn the calling of the function, learn the accessing of the methods and everything involved in these

165
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:05.470
steps, one by one, without missing any single point.

166
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.290
Like we have to create this project from scratch.

167
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:14.090
So we are not going to miss any of this fact while making this project.

168
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:22.160
So in the next video, we are going to create a new project which is the first step in our ID like we

169
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.100
have to create a Java project named the Snake Ophelia or names of your choice.

170
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.550
It's totally upon you.

171
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.340
So, yes, let's get started.

172
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.140
So in the next video.
