1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,310
In previous videos and tutorials.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:12,030
I told you how we can create some JSP files here and we are done with our servlet patch, so we are

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,850
now focused only with JSP part.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,470
So let me close this index.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,400
What is HTML?

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,170
So we created one admin panel JSP for admin panel student list JSP for the student list instruction

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,530
list for that instruction purposes and question list for the question list purposes, let us see how

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,260
we can create an update student.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,470
JSP Because we mentioned your update.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,760
Student So we need to create updated student.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,500
So.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,390
Let me create one GSP student here.

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,640
Finish.

14
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,000
So bring this on me and.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,330
Remember when you are writing Java files inside this?

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,850
You need to specify.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,640
This FinTechs.

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,480
So let me create a student visa list.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,280
Update student.

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,520
Then.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,930
Let me show you so our page language Java studio because it contains that update student.

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,720
I'm using ArrayList here also.

23
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,120
So let me print your title update.

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:35,930
Don't.

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,380
I'm using bootstrap method in this.

26
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,200
Again.

27
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,400
With this, as usual, I'd be.

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,360
This is all about these things.

29
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,940
Then studio.

30
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,150
I'm using this method.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,130
I'm invoking that ArrayList.

32
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,770
Then this all student.

33
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,530
It will fetch if request not get parameter username for that particular user if our great username which

34
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:14,090
is basically for that specific user, if that is correct, what it will be do it will go to the update.

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,050
Student No, no, what is that update?

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:23,820
Student Now, we already created updates to the JSP, so why we require so if I want to change the username,

37
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,450
if I want to change the name, if I want to change the password, there should be another JSP file to

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,470
process that purpose.

39
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,200
You can include in the same JSP file, but for some simpler purpose.

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,550
Or we can say for the user friendliness and managing purpose, I'm going to use this.

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,740
So again, get the username for this update student.

42
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,490
Which I already created, and this is for the student.

43
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,260
So this is very simple.

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,820
JS file as I told you.

45
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,910
You need to create only this part.

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:10,450
And if that for loop if that which means if that matches to that part only you can easily use this x

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,090
go with the specific that name only.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,990
No need to change that because student is not available.

49
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:17,990
Simple.

50
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,270
So let us see how we can create a student in to part here.

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,650
So let me copy this.

52
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,590
I'm going to create another JSP here.

53
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,450
So as you can see, we have some more JSP files than.

54
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,250
Our part.

55
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,370
So this will contain basic logic of updating.

56
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,020
But so.

57
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,170
Let me.

58
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,340
Use this part of that student now.

59
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,790
And this is.

60
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,330
Instead of deciding what I'm going to put is.

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
The thing.

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,850
Student.

63
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,110
Inform.

64
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,850
I will bring this so it will use this student because I want to update in that part only with student

65
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,790
the model.

66
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,580
It will import this only and ArrayList and everything.

67
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:28,680
So what it will be do it will new user ID, new password, new name which original id you ID and everything.

68
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,780
If this is done like student space, we are already created student lives.

69
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,740
It will send direct to that part.

70
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,100
If not else, it will go in the that error in the database and everything then.

71
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,550
So this is all about how we can create a student notepad.

72
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,360
So this is just a logic, not very important.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,090
Or you can say you can easily use in the student only.

74
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,000
But I just created another part.

75
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,170
So this is very important because this contains the logic of changing username, password and name.

76
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,320
Which original also.

77
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,620
So this is done with average students.

78
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,130
So let us see how we can create some dilute student part also here.

79
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,050
Let me create a JSP file here again.

80
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,670
Delete student.

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,090
We believe this part because this contains some default code.

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,070
While you are creating JSP.

83
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,590
So we don't want to print hello world in the student.

84
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,200
We need to create a logic for deleting students.

85
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,710
So let me create the student part here.

86
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,110
Delete student.

87
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,160
Just need to remove that part only.

88
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,950
So what we are going to do is just deleting that part.

89
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,610
Did the student list and delete record.

90
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,680
Delete record is already mentioned in that database and we are going to delete that record.

91
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,740
So let me change the title here also.

92
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,760
Okay.

93
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,260
Delete student.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,840
Look, now we are done with that student part.

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,800
So we just created update student and student.

96
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,450
Update Student Contents.

97
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,290
Update Student.

98
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:37,560
Now JSP You can directly use these codes because I already created this part.

99
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,710
So remember what I mentioned here is student is with new, student with username.

100
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,840
This if the username is this, I'm going to delete records and it will send me to this.

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,300
If not, it should print it out there.

102
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,660
So that's it about how we can create delete student So now we are done with student list.

103
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,780
Let us see how we can create instruction list here or we need to create instruction, update instruction

104
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,710
and all these things.

105
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,200
Instruction.

106
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,910
Web pages or JSP file here I'm going to create.

107
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,020
Instruction.

108
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,380
So in further videos, I'm going to show you how we can create an answer.

109
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,200
And I agree methods so I don't I have very less time limit here.

110
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,970
Due to time constraint, I'm just doing this.

111
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,460
So let us see how we can create a best instruction method here.

112
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,100
So as we created an object student part, we need to create a Buddhist instruction methodology.

113
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,390
So again, I'm importing all these things.

114
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,630
Remember, I'm importing pages, all pages.

115
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,510
Let me change this.

116
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,540
A date.

117
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,820
Instructions.

118
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,390
With this number because it's an important instruction operation.

119
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,780
The operation is basically basically for the update part, it will get the parameter for that purpose.

120
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:18,160
If that insert part is equal, it will go to that part, or otherwise it will go to the delete part.

121
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,680
We update instructions and delete instructions.

122
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,560
Remember, I need to create update instruction now method also because it contains the logic of that

123
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,700
object instruction.

124
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,740
Similarly, as I created for.

125
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,640
Student list.

126
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:48,160
So result will contain all the result information for that student purpose.

127
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:49,980
Okay.

128
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,110
So update instruction now.

129
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,830
Let me save this post and let me show this first also.

130
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,720
So, as you know, update instructions students know contains this.

131
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,620
I will just copy this because I want to insert title here again.

132
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,710
I'm dating.

133
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,630
These options.

134
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,540
That's it.

135
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,910
Similarly, we created this.

136
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,100
I need to create this part again because if original then modified.

137
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,410
If yes instruction list it will send me to directly to that part.

138
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,250
If not, it shows me the error.

139
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,200
So this is basic logic for that update instruction.

140
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,140
Now what we require.

141
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,910
So we are done with this.

142
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,570
So now we are needed.

143
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,660
The lead instruction part.

144
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,920
Also, let me create another delete instruction.

145
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,640
Yes.

146
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,660
If I'll only.

147
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,650
Just be only.

148
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,130
Okay.

149
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,760
This.

150
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,600
New GSP.

151
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:10,930
Okay.

152
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,840
Remember the names here?

153
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,680
If you are mentioning some other names, it will not work.

154
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,810
No created.

155
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,560
Delete this.

156
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,720
Again.

157
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,150
Delivered instruction.

158
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,100
So let me read one instruction part also here.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,470
Again, simple logic.

160
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,580
Or delete instruction.

161
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,590
Instruction is that instruction get parameter which basically in instruction if that delete record.

162
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,780
So where is the delete record I'm using is.

163
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,220
Delete instruction.

164
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,520
So this from the TV and that model.

165
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,060
Instructions.

166
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,610
So I'm deleting and I'm what I'm using delete record inside the instruction.

167
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,910
So now you can understand why I am using the solid part.

168
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:44,830
If I am not using different packages, it will take too much time for the creation of the solid.

169
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:52,470
So creating a servlet is a task for the developer, as you can see, because I need to create and I

170
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,930
need to mention everything inside that purpose.

171
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:01,080
So once I created this inside that model, it contains instruction to go to the delete record.

172
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,450
So I'm using that method in that part.

173
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,710
So as you can see inside the model instruction duo contains delete record method.

174
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,090
So now we are done with the instruction part.

175
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,470
So our remaining part is now the question list.

176
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:25,020
So let's see how we can use that question list again, because it also contains a question or question

177
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,040
list of that question.

178
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,710
It's a new GSP.

179
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,570
Similar things I'm using.

180
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:38,800
I'm using similar logic, but variables are different just because it contains all different.

181
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,940
And it's it is using the database.

182
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,420
So let me create.

183
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,130
And I already created.

184
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,780
Let us see how we can create.

185
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,420
This mental.

186
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,090
Okay.

187
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,090
So.

188
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,590
Update Christian method.

189
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,100
So now this is done only.

190
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,800
Oh, okay.

191
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,570
Now this is done.

192
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:16,810
But the update question now is remaining which contains logic and is very similar thing like.

193
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,210
These only.

194
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,840
And let me put here is that question.

195
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,930
And it will create this GSP and it's required this part also.

196
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,800
Similar thing.

197
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,050
Delete that part because it contains some default code.

198
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,580
Go do this part and.

199
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,560
So I am not deploying it again and again because at the end of this program or everything, I'm going

200
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,000
to deploy it a single time or I'm going to deploy in the single part.

201
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:02,840
So.

202
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,030
Let me use this one.

203
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,430
Okay, so similar thing.

204
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,770
I'm using this.

205
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,020
I'm dating.

206
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,830
Christians.

207
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,150
Okay.

208
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,040
So.

209
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,250
This will import everything and you importing only questions do you?

210
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,430
Because this is only required no need to import DB or anything.

211
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,100
Option An option B options the option DM importing.

212
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,790
If the answer, then if you are changing something.

213
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,870
Or to use questions it will redirect to this part.

214
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,800
If the status is not error error in the database, it's not exceptionally awkward.

215
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,480
You can put that part.

216
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,680
So this is all about how we can create instruction, video and everything.

217
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,590
In further part, I'm going to create some ad questions and everything, so I will just go through that

218
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,650
and I will deploy our project on the server.
