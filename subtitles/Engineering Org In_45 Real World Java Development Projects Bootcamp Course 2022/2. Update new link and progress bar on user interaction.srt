1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,610
My project by the name simple browser.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Here the folder is RC Domain and the junk.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:12,300
Under this we will create a new package by the name sample browser and then click fresh.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:20,770
In this package, we will create our class by the name, browser, browser or Java.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,940
So here I get my class.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:32,080
Firstly, we will extend in the class application from which we will get our properties on the Java

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,730
effects.

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,790
So here and we have to import this also imposed on Java.

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:52,050
Now firstly, what we will do, we will override the method which really we don't like before it starts

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,810
the primary.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,440
Speech and prose exception

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,390
key although.

13
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,570
All right.

14
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,310
Unimplemented, immature.

15
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,580
I got this one already generated.

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,880
Now we will write our code.

17
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:33,460
First we will do the tapping and continue tapping here this one

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:45,100
afterwards we will do the tap start said taps closing policy.

19
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,490
You know, maybe I have.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,020
Certainly.

21
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,850
Yeah.

22
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,740
Now what?

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,350
We will give the values.

24
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,930
We will do the tapping or tap closing policy.

25
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,670
Not all taps.

26
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,110
No.

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,280
Will make another class.

28
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,180
This is a one.

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,530
Firstly, make one thing.

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,900
Also we include a new class as well.

31
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,420
And start.

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,030
What to do?

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,610
Yeah, the main class.

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,800
Our main class?

35
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,330
After this.

36
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,040
Key.

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,740
No.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,530
Hood Public.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah, right.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,300
So the public yeah.

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:03:00,630
So extending it mean trim and she's smart simple one now in the browser dot main and here this one.

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,040
Okay so.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,170
Here?

44
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,640
Yes.

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:22,310
We have to drill now or we will do we will create a new class and new single page and then finish.

46
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,520
Now in this class.

47
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,780
Firstly, we will create our variables.

48
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,600
No, see, we will try the private view.

49
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:45,190
You know, another one is the private Indian.

50
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,430
Indian.

51
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,600
And afterwards we will clean the private

52
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,420
text.

53
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,250
Feel as though you are in text field, which we will need.

54
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,730
And what are the rules?

55
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,170
We will see that.

56
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,080
So we have to import this also.

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,360
Here, I will import all these things.

58
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,740
Now done.

59
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,270
Now, afterwards, we will do one thing.

60
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,720
Also, we will make the constructor also.

61
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,520
The single page.

62
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:41,090
And under this we will make a method initial page and we will keep it blank and give its body afterwards.

63
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,240
Right.

64
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:58,470
So what we will do in this matter, we will give the all functionality of our initial page.

65
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,350
What we will do?

66
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,720
What will it open?

67
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,090
So now from here onwards, fill.

68
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,820
Right.

69
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,370
Those few equal to Newman view.

70
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,280
The Sun and the.

71
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,770
In just a second here.

72
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,810
The small one.

73
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,270
Sorry.

74
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,240
Not right.

75
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,710
Easily some.

76
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,740
Yeah, this one.

77
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,770
No.

78
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,300
Look back in June and then write down you.

79
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,500
This one not get attention right now.

80
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,950
Of course, we need one more thing that is private.

81
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,900
The box.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,200
This one name returns to the box.

83
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,390
So here we will do one thing.

84
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,600
Also out of the box.

85
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,370
Sorry.

86
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,530
This Reebok sequel to new Reeboks.

87
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,470
This one.

88
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,040
And afterwards we will take the edge box also.

89
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,510
These are the horizontal and vertical boxes.

90
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:39,590
In some problems this actually controls.

91
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,520
Ball.

92
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,060
Yeah.

93
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,140
Control Smoke.

94
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,080
Sequel to New Box.

95
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,810
The soon afterwards, we will do we will call our text field.

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,620
This one is called the new.

97
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,750
Fixed field.

98
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,380
Hmm.

99
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,680
Okay.

100
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,990
Starting this one, your text field.

101
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:24,140
And then afterwards, we will give us the we will give to you first the load you are in.

102
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:36,340
And then we will take the example of the two http colon backslash one dot com

103
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,760
colon more happened.

104
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,550
Okay.

105
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,920
We will create this matter after all.

106
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,070
And now you are all text filled or sent text.

107
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,420
This one.

108
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,230
And give them a clue here.

109
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,940
Also htp or non backslash?

110
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,320
Not con, no.

111
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,740
Here we will write our progress bar.

112
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,730
We will create the progress.

113
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:29,080
This one we need this one to name it as the bar, the p, the equal to new progress over here.

114
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:37,630
And what we will do, the pr dot we will give it the right property.

115
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:49,690
So pre this one pre revert property and we will bind this one bind with the vertical locks as well.

116
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:57,100
So we start here also in the root property.

117
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:07,810
So this one, the only property, the property and afterwards when the user interacts, the link changes.

118
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,650
So we have to update the text field with the new link also.

119
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,290
Now we will create our new functions.

120
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:27,730
So here what we will do and the user interacts and the link changes.

121
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,720
We will update the text field.

122
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,360
With the new link.

123
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:44,250
So here what we do is called love engine, not location.

124
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,580
This location property.

125
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,460
And call the listener method.

126
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,280
This.

127
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,290
You know what we will do?

128
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,280
We will give it stoke value.

129
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:07,280
The values are firstly the new and new change listener.

130
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:20,380
You know, change this one change listener.

131
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,080
But we have to convert it to string also.

132
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,060
So you okay?

133
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,360
I'd give it as a string.

134
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,630
Not the TV, but we will write you a string.

135
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,720
What happened?

136
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,710
You change listener.

137
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,640
Okay.

138
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,450
Here.

139
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,860
Here.

140
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,110
You got the override marker.

141
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,580
Public void change.

142
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,440
Observable value.

143
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,360
So here.

144
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,410
What we will do.

145
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:10,120
We will take the text field which we have created and give the set text value in the string.

146
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,560
And here we will write the new value.

147
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:22,490
This one done here we have created our and the colon.

148
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,060
So all things are done.

149
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,690
Know what to do after forwards.

150
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,020
Now we have updated the text field with the new link.

151
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,680
So also we have to update the progress for our progress while it is loading.

152
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,020
So here what we will do, we will update our.

153
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:57,050
Okay, firstly, right, we have to update the progress bars progress

154
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,980
while the web page is loading this.

155
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:13,670
So here we will create a rhythm in Jakarta called fibrinogen node get load worker.

156
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:21,340
I think the load worker and afterwards we will call the work done property and then the listener thing

157
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,240
listener.

158
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:29,390
And then here we will also get the new changes not.

159
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:40,360
And now here we will give our number property, not the string, and write the number.

160
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,570
So here it will give us the overwriting method as well, this one.

161
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,820
And here we will write about properties.

162
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,710
So what we will need.

163
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:06,130
Firstly, we have to call the P bar our progress bar and give it a set visible and here we will go over

164
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,860
by default through value first.

165
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,470
Cool.

166
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:19,600
Then we will call the Beamer, of course, again, and then we will set the progress here.

167
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,110
And we will write the new value and it will begin to double.

168
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,760
So we will write the double value, and here it's done.

169
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,480
And now we have to build the conditions.

170
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:42,790
If the progress is equal to 100 excited to false and then it will give zero.

171
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,050
So we will try it with the we will take the loop.

172
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:57,880
Then we have to give the condition so we will use P but not get progress.

173
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,250
Yeah.

174
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,650
The sun that progress is equal to 100.

175
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:13,800
So you take the parentheses and write the p bar not set visible.

176
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,280
And here we will give the false, of course.

177
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:26,070
And after we set it to E but not set progress.

178
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,190
Set progress.

179
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,080
And here we get the zero.

180
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,120
And it's done.

181
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,460
And all these things are done.

182
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,760
It needs a colon, of course.

183
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,000
And here we have done our things.

184
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,290
Now what we will do, we have to give the actions.

185
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,200
What what will our buttons will do when we action on?

186
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,540
So we have to run first.

187
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,980
No, I think it has to be complete.

188
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,360
So what we will do, we will create the buttons.

189
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,470
So you are in text field.

190
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,880
I'm not set on action.

191
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,460
Sit on this one and write.

192
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,620
You know you are in parentheses.

193
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,680
When you are, it is loading.

194
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:28,880
No.

195
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,030
You are in.

196
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,560
And.

197
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,390
Something.

198
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,560
Okay.

199
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,800
This one, the Lord you are.

200
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:50,190
And then we will call the URL text field or get text in a string form.

201
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,460
And.

202
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,230
And what happened here?

203
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,210
Okay.

204
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,850
We will create our method afterwards.

205
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,650
And it's done here.

206
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:07,290
And after this thing, what we need to back in the forward button also.

207
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,670
Firstly, back we created a bridge.

208
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,290
We will source something.

209
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,160
We have to go back.

210
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,480
Also, we have seen in our browser there was the option to go back and the forward and the reload option.

211
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,740
So we will create a three buttons.

212
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,160
Firstly, we will create the back button and name it as the back button.

213
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,400
We will use the camel case here.

214
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:41,190
So back button equals to new button to start back.

215
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,980
Or you can also give the images as well.

216
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,730
If we only.

217
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:59,370
But I'm simply writing the back here and here back button and set on action the event handler which

218
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,030
we are using and here we go.

219
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:09,120
It's action back which we will create it.

220
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:15,240
Here I am using this function and we will create its body afterwards.

221
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,350
And now what we need, we have created the back button as well.

222
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,330
So now what?

223
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,790
We need a new button to forward.

224
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,590
We have created the back.

225
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,040
Now we need the forward button.

226
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,340
Always remember the camel case, of course.

227
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:44,010
And then new button name returns forward, this one clone.

228
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:59,820
And then we set its action also to forward button not set on action on here what I do, created or not

229
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,870
done.

230
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:13,500
And right here we will do one thing also here we make another matter animate to go forward.

231
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,680
We will give it my third body afterwards.

232
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,430
Here I have created this.

233
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,980
This is done.

234
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,950
Now another.

235
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:35,520
And the last thing is the button, reload, reload, button and equal to new button many more times

236
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,530
to reload, of course, and clone semicolon.

237
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:54,270
And then we will give the listener to that reload button not set on action name does this one give some

238
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:04,890
space insert and make another method by being called reload and here our part is done.

239
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,030
So what do we have done here?

240
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,410
Firstly, we have the user and drag the link change and updated the text field with the new link.

241
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,000
So here it's done.

242
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:29,550
And another thing is we have created the updated the progress bar and this progress bar while the back

243
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,690
page is loading.

244
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:41,010
And another thing which we need, okay, so we have okay, we have to do one more thing as well.

245
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,580
One type of URL in the text field, it has to stretch as well.

246
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,100
So we have not done this thing, so we have to do that thing.
