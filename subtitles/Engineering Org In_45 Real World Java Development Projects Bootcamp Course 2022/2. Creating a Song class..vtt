00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.280
We need to create a new project from the file menu.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.090
So go to the project mode in our application.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.290
And inside that sources we have our package called com dot.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.290
What whatever the name in your ID.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.280
So let's create a new class of songs and in that class as song or Java under that package.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.290
So the first thing that we are going to need is a string string, which is the name of a song, so let's

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.330
call it a title.

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.260
And the second thing that we have is the song duration.

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.810
So we take it as double.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.120
Let and another one we will have a constructive hearing on both things to be initialized.

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.640
So the string and the duration double which is are initialized or sliding, we can easily generate this

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.630
automatically.

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.850
Right, right.

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.440
Clicking our control.

15
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.560
And now we will create an empty constructor as well, although we are not going to use it.

16
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.440
But still, let's have one.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.800
Okay, so we have this empty structure.

18
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.530
Now let's have a getter method for title as well as the duration.

19
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.430
So the get title and the get duration of our getter.

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.410
And we also need our two string method and it will give the public string to two string.

21
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.090
So it will be what it does, that it will return whatever the property of the class.

22
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:39.360
So here, the class of song, we have this string title and a double duration, so it will simply print

23
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.740
those things for us.

24
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.270
So here we have this, a public string, two string method.

25
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.250
So it's simply returning whatever we have in this class.

26
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.370
And finally, this is all about the song class and what will be the next thing that we are going to

27
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.350
need is a class of album.
