1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,920
Between the previews we do we are having you know, pointed exception to.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,830
Before 912.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:15,260
Do we have to display the images here first so we will right display image and here we will give the

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,040
parameter to raw and give the label name as well.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,810
So here Chile will draw same here.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,620
Similar to that we will try to display image and give it the parameter.

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:39,380
The people and the label name would be put here and forces here.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:49,400
We will display image and this will give the parameter to see those labels users.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,620
So here we have done this part on.

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,880
Known.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,460
Simply run the file.

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,410
Okay.

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,930
So we are having a procedure here when we have to.

14
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:23,640
We need a game frame here and we will do one thing.

15
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,280
Okay.

16
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,320
We need.

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,310
Q So they have done one thing wrong here, thing here.

18
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,170
Change the barometer in height and width.

19
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,840
Make it to the world.

20
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,430
Keep it to the height here.

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:13,130
And we will give the size 100 by 100 here.

22
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,490
100 100.

23
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,770
The soon to the height and avert.

24
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,300
No.

25
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,460
Can't hear them.

26
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,300
So these are phone.

27
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,310
Hundred.

28
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,250
100.

29
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,920
See here.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,560
200 by 100.

31
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,530
Now we need a red list.

32
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:17,680
Hmm.

33
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,310
Well, do.

34
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,170
Before constructor.

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,830
We will create ArrayList here.

36
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,020
You will write ArrayList of String.

37
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,610
Done.

38
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,640
New list.

39
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,690
We done.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,800
So we have added this to this list.

41
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,530
No, we have to mean it.

42
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,030
So here we have a constructor.

43
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,350
Now we will display images.

44
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:13,770
Okay.

45
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,310
No, we will do this.

46
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,100
Here we have displayed the image in No Labels.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,100
So this part is done.

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,870
Two labels.

49
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,200
And now another part which we need.

50
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,350
We have to add items to the list.

51
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,590
We will do.

52
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,760
And I flipped through the list here.

53
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,590
So we will start at

54
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
the start and.

55
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,370
The third and last one we really start at.

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,290
Scissors.

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,740
Sanders.

58
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,570
This is John.

59
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,240
Dude.

60
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,690
We helped create the world.

61
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,170
Okay.

62
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,910
We have create a list.

63
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:23,960
Okay.

64
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:40,210
So now we have to do we need a random pick our random random include new random unknown.

65
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,670
So import this first.

66
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,660
We imported.

67
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,670
Know what we have to do here.

68
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,470
We need variable also or score.

69
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,120
It's will clean and.

70
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,520
Okay.

71
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,890
In.

72
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,570
You can write your events.

73
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,630
And so I to the zero.

74
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,560
Same goes with the computer to Vince and set it to zero.

75
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,270
Next thing, we need a string.

76
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,990
Random selection.

77
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,440
This is done.

78
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,360
No.

79
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,700
Go to the rock mostly.

80
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,460
Even here, we will make a random selection.

81
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,960
So here we are.

82
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,240
Random selection first, right?

83
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,110
Random.

84
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,060
We need the random selection equal to.

85
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,210
We need the list Lord you get.

86
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:33,020
Here we will write random dot next to end.

87
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,890
And the rich.

88
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,180
We will write

89
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,050
must not size

90
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,030
then.

91
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,150
Okay.

92
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,960
What do we have to do?

93
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,970
We need a more display image.

94
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,400
Okay, so we have to display a random selection.

95
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,010
So next thing to do.

96
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,730
Display image here.

97
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,170
We write, we will call our mother display image.

98
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,270
From here, we will give the parameter a random selection.

99
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,110
Give it to the.

100
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:42,290
Geneva computer and give the height and the weight to the hundred and 100 subject to the 102 hundred.

101
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,440
For every mouse click the even we have to do this.

102
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,390
Things seem as it is.

103
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:58,340
So we will write in the scissor mouse click even to.

104
00:08:59,330 --> 00:08:59,730
Okay.

105
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,580
Here.

106
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,170
We know selection,

107
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,040
right.

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,840
Random selection equal to.

109
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,820
Let's start that random next in.

110
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,760
The ritual, a barometer to list out.

111
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,040
Signs

112
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,620
that we will display our image.

113
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,210
So display image, whatever the random selection.

114
00:09:51,740 --> 00:10:04,990
Set it to the G label computer and give the height and width 200 by 101

115
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,840
C with the scissor.

116
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,820
We had random selection.

117
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,380
Right.

118
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,650
Random selection.

119
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,940
Equal to news told.

120
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:37,980
Get this, we will write random thought.

121
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:56,340
Next end give the barometer to nest dot size display image guitar barometer route random selection,

122
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:03,660
set the label to computer and set the height and lower 200 again.

123
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,260
So here this part is done.

124
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,440
Now, another part which we have to do is to create a function to get the winner.
