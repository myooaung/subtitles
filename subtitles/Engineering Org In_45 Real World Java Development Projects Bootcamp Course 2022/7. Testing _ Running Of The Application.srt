1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,810
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:10,150
So till now, we have created all the classes which are going to be required inside this contact repository

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,250
interface application.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,940
We have created the main class which will be responsible for testing and running of the application.

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:27,070
We have created this contact class, which is like performing the getting and setting, like accessing

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,190
and updating of the labels of the form.

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:37,470
We have created this repository and object repository class which are like handling the key value per

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,230
thing or listing every thing inside the form in the form of a key and a value.

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:50,200
So specific action is like attached to specific key.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:59,980
So yes, this repository is helping us to update, remove and extract data which is stored inside the

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,700
repository or for specific saved content.

12
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:13,180
So this repository makes both the repository and object repository has made the extracting and storing

13
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,460
of the data very convenient.

14
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:25,210
Now in the last part we have created this GSC Frame class, which is basically the frame inside which

15
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:32,290
the yes, the concept stands, whether it be the repository or the form are contained inside.

16
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,540
So yes, this frame.

17
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,570
Is containing fields for all of.

18
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:45,390
Yes, this is for the contact site and this is for the contact information site.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,880
We have a division between both of them.

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,820
The contacts and the contacts is one mission.

21
00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:02,020
We have set our layout and our like size border everything to both of the sections inside the frame.

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,310
So inside the contact information, we have set of labels for the first name, last name and all of

23
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,420
the like required labels inside the form.

24
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:21,760
And also we have set the line drop and the for the notes and the address labels.

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,150
So the line rep is going to be work inside this.

26
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,670
Our line will be changed once this like we have set the size to 20.

27
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,720
So if this 20 is full, then the line will automatically change and the input will start appearing from

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,530
the next line.

29
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,050
So yes, till then we have covered all the three buttons we move, update and add.

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,860
We have now attached action to all three of them.

31
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:56,740
Now in this part we are going to add all the labels state fields repository to the contact frame, like

32
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,560
the contact frame we have created.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,990
So once creating all the things we have to add in order to make them visible to the frame.

34
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:14,290
So yes, this layout is going to be like this, how things are going to be added.

35
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,340
So firstly, the panel, the title panel is going to be attached.

36
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,490
The contacts title and the contact information later to that are like we have to add a gap between them

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,660
here.

38
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:37,750
There is a short gap between both the sections and in the next part we are adding like the labels or

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,560
the first name.

40
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,070
Last name would send everything to the frame.

41
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:49,390
So this training helps us to that, like aligning of the elements inside the frame.

42
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:58,390
So once the there is the end of a line, then automatically it should change its alignment to the next

43
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,930
line.

44
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,230
So first name after that trailing then last name email.

45
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,510
For the phone number, for web address, for address, and for everything.

46
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,960
So we have used trailing for that purpose.

47
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,400
Yes.

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,830
So adding components inside the frame is done with the help of dot add keyword.

49
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,160
We have already discussed this in the previous part.

50
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,940
So yes, this add this adds a group.

51
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,160
So add group for the.

52
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,530
We have two sequences, contacts and contact information.

53
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,480
So basically there are two groups.

54
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:46,360
Now adding components helps us to like align things one by one, add components in a parallel group

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,150
with specified alignment.

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,880
So we have like a decided alignment above here.

57
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,410
Now after earning.

58
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,240
All of them inside the frame.

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,090
So the frame is looking like this.

60
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,760
There is a blob that is a vertical gap between this block and this block.

61
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,480
So this vertical grouping is done.

62
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,010
Ted.

63
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,800
Said Vertical group.

64
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:23,270
So between both the vertical groups are basically that are two vertical gaps, one between these two

65
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,690
blocks and one between this label and the text field.

66
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:34,890
So this vertical group is for the like, what's the gap between the label and the text field?

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,610
So that is label for all of them.

68
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,360
First name, last name, email.

69
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,420
And then after that text, we'll attach it to that.

70
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:54,290
So this related keyword is used to attach that text field and basically that label and the text field

71
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,880
are going to be related.

72
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,940
Like this first name is related to this text field or not or other text fields.

73
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:12,650
So all of the text fields are related to their specific labels and there should be no overlapping in

74
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,640
any manner.

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:21,800
That specific relation is unique for all of the labels and which is done here with the help of this

76
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,460
related.

77
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,430
Now, yes.

78
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,710
Till now we have covered all the groupings are in alignment.

79
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,350
Thanks.

80
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,820
Now in the next part.

81
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,520
Here it is, Java String Group layout.

82
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:45,220
So this group layout is managed inside this like a method layout function and this method is managing

83
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,930
the panels, whether it be this panel or this panel.

84
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,230
So the layout of the panels is managed inside.

85
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,910
This are the default size that is for both of the panels.

86
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,060
Here it is set to 208 by default.

87
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:10,840
So you can see that the panel is like a little distance from the left side and this much distance from

88
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,690
the bottom border.

89
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,210
So, yes, this is for the sizing of both the panels.

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:29,590
And later, we have used this back pivot in order to pack all of them inside the window.

91
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:36,130
So this pack keyword enables packing all of the panels inside the window itself.

92
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:42,550
So once we minimize our maximize it, it resizes itself accordingly.

93
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:51,700
With the help of this pack, now that we have set the layout and grid the layout of all of the panels

94
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,960
inside the frame.

95
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,510
So the next concern is to add action looseness to the button.

96
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,610
So we have created like text fields and three buttons.

97
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,080
So the actions attached to the buttons are going to be listed here.

98
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:16,150
So once we import any text inside the labels, the last name, first name, email are everything.

99
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:23,710
Then it should be added to the repository which is being created this side of the frame.

100
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:31,960
So yes, once we hit the enter on that, then it should be attached to that specific selection.

101
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,860
And on clicking that selection, it all should appear in the form of our repository and also the list

102
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,400
module.

103
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,940
So everything is added in the form of a list of course.

104
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:49,390
So we have called the repository dot add to add all of the inputs made by the user.

105
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:58,930
And also from closing a form window closing will appear after hitting update button and add button.

106
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:06,850
So this new form will appear once we close like this and that specific contact will be added to the

107
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,700
repository in the left side of the frame.

108
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,540
Now after this, we have created list contact value change.

109
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:23,440
So once there is any kind of update in the values of the text field, then it should be reflected inside

110
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,420
the selection.

111
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:33,190
So suppose if we click, we update, like in the working part, we have updated the web address of this

112
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:42,100
contact and once we click on this update button, then after opening the option contact again, the

113
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,970
updated value will be reflected in the form.

114
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,330
So yes, this is responsible for changing the value after that.

115
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,660
Yes, this is the update functionalities we have created above here the update button.

116
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,110
Yes, it is.

117
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:07,660
So the action performed function was created here and the action is listed here.

118
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,340
Over this part.

119
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,460
So yes, for the update and the remove.

120
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,370
So contact's value changed.

121
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,920
And the move action performed.

122
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,250
So all of the action perform are listed here inside this part of the snippet.

123
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,710
And all of them are actions attached to all three of the buttons.

124
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,490
Now.

125
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:43,540
So then we have attached a unique value change to all three of the buttons, whether it be the remove

126
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,170
button, we have a specific value chain, the function for that.

127
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:54,520
Similarly for the update button, a value chain function for that and the add above here.

128
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:03,730
So after completing all three of the action handling of the buttons now in the file, like a conclusion,

129
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:11,440
we are adding everything, whether it be the button, all three of them, the labels and the text fields

130
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,600
to the frame.

131
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:20,070
So here we are declaring the variables we have been using above there.

132
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:27,640
So the declaration pattern's done here for all of the variables, or we can call it as objects.

133
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:36,640
So these are the total objects which are being used inside this GC frame class, or they can be accessed

134
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
inside other classes also.

135
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,700
Okay, so at the end this will list items.

136
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:49,420
So once the list item is filled, we are using a for loop for getting all of them.

137
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,240
So once we click on a specific content, a for loop is attached for every contact.

138
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,790
So on clicking this a list, a full list will be accessed with the help of this.

139
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,080
Get all key word from the repository, of course.

140
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,210
Okay.

141
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,920
So this clear input is marking.

142
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:16,210
Like this whenever we hit the update and the clear input will appear.

143
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:26,170
So all of the text fields will again set to empty whenever we clear the input of any text field.

144
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,100
So once we hit on the update button, we will encounter that.

145
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,450
We will.

146
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,510
So we will encounter this when we will run this program.

147
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,080
So the overall programming execution part is completed.

148
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:50,610
Now we have completed all five of the classes which are required inside this application.

149
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,170
Now jump into the main class and trying to run this.

150
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,780
We will see that everything is working perfectly fine or not.

151
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,100
So this is working perfectly fine.

152
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,270
We will remove this.

153
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,750
And then this contact frame is open.

154
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,740
There is a panel for contact contact information.

155
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,570
The buttons, the text fields and the labels.

156
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,250
So let us try adding something.

157
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,850
So let us type something random only in order to check that everything is working fine or not.

158
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,730
The number should contain numbers.

159
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,530
Web address.

160
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,370
Dot com and the email should contain.

161
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,500
At the date like this format and.

162
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,450
Address could be anything any random text on hitting on this add button.

163
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,410
This is added.

164
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,620
On opening this, it appears now again hitting.

165
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,040
Let us try to change this to a new contact.

166
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,480
Okay.

167
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,900
So we have been trying to add a new contact to the list.

168
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,550
Okay.

169
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,770
So we have added the second one.

170
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:20,900
Now, I like wanting to check the functionalities of this update and remove also.

171
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,680
So let us try to update this address to New Delhi.

172
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,780
And check that whether the upgrade functionality is working perfectly or not.

173
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,590
So hitting on this update and the input is clear, input for it is clear.

174
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:48,940
We have seen this in the last part we were discussing about it is yes, this clear input is called every

175
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,320
time when we.

176
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,250
I'll click on any button, so let us check that whether the address is updated or not.

177
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:04,450
So yes, the second one, the address is updated successfully, so the update is working perfectly fine.

178
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,950
We have added to contacts, so that key is also working perfectly fine.

179
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,750
Now let us try to remove one of them.

180
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,890
So, yes, selecting the first contact and hitting on this removed button.

181
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,540
So yes, it is removed.

182
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,760
So this application is working perfectly fine in every manner.

183
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,380
All the buttons are working perfectly, the text fields are taking input.

184
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,940
The repository site is also working like clicking this.

185
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,160
We are able to get all the information of that specific contact.

186
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,360
So yes, now we have covered everything in this project.

187
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,010
The testing and running part is also done successfully.

188
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:53,370
So I hope that you all have gained much idea about Java after the completion of this project.

189
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:00,690
Now I would encourage you all to try making this project on your own so that it will make you much aware

190
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,220
about these concepts we have applied inside this tutorial.

191
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,060
So thank you all for joining this session.

192
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,640
And once again, I would encourage you all to make this project on your own.

193
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,120
So thank you.
