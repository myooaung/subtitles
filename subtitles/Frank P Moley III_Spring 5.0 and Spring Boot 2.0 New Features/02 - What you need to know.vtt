00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] There's really only a few things

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.080
that you need to know in order to be

3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.080
successful in this course.

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.000
First and foremost, the use of the Java language.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.030
Now I'm going to be focused on using Java 11

6
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.020
throughout this course, but you should

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.090
be able to use any supported version of Java

8
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.000
that is available within the Spring Initializr selection.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.040
I also expect you to have some basic

10
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.070
knowledge of how Spring works.

11
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.070
After all, we're going to be talking

12
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.060
about the new features of Spring itself.

13
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.010
If you'd like to bump up some of your

14
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.090
knowledge on the Spring framework

15
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.020
I have several courses available in the LinkedIn

16
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.090
learning library that you can choose from

17
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.070
that will teach you the basics of Spring

18
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.060
as well as Spring Brute and some of the

19
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.050
more advanced topics like Spring Security.

20
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.000
Throughout this course I will be using

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.070
Maven as a dependency manager and a build system.

22
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.030
I don't need you to be an expert in Maven

23
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.080
but I do ask that you at least have

24
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.030
the baseline knowledge so that you can

25
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.020
use Maven effectively throughout this course.

26
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.080
Another aspect that I'm going to be using

27
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.010
is my IDE.

28
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.040
Now, I use InteliJ Ultimate.

29
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.030
You do not need to use this IDE.

30
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.020
In fact, you can use any IDE that you

31
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.020
are comfortable with for Java development.

32
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.030
There's also Spring plugins for many

33
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.000
other IDE's out there, and I do encourage

34
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.080
you to use those for your IDE of choice.

35
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.070
The big thing here is understand

36
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.080
how to use your IDE.

37
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.020
I may use features built into mine to generate

38
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.060
getters and setters and things like that.

39
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.030
There are equivalent options and tools

40
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.080
throughout all the IDE's to do very similar tasks.

41
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.070
So just know how to use your IDE really well

42
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.090
in order to be effective in this course.

43
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.000
And with that, let's get started.
