00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Instructor] So now that we've run through

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.040
all of the changes that occurred

3
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.070
with Spring 5 and 5.1, and Spring Boot 2.0,

4
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.060
you may be asking yourself what's next.

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.020
I encourage you to engage.

6
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.060
That's the first and foremost thing

7
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.000
that I hope you take out of this course.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.090
Spend some time and play with all of these feature changes.

9
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.070
Read about 'em, look 'em up, try to manipulate 'em

10
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.050
and find ways where they can improve

11
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.070
your efficiency within your existing company.

12
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.010
I also encourage you to read about

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.090
why the changes were made.

14
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.060
To be an active member of the community,

15
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.020
you not only have to be able to utilize the tooling,

16
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.080
you have to know where they're going and what they're doing,

17
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.000
so that you can make good decisions as a software developer

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.040
about where to take your code.

19
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.020
I also always encourage you to try something new.

20
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.070
Software development, that's part of the fun of it,

21
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.080
is learning how to do things new,

22
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.030
trying new technologies, trying new constructs,

23
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.060
and doing things in a new way.

24
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.040
And with Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2,

25
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.090
we get that, we get the reactive model.

26
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.000
We get the new way of doing metrics.

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.090
There's lots of things that come with this

28
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.030
that we can try new,

29
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.020
that may be the next great thing for our company.

30
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.020
And lastly here, I highly encourage you,

31
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.010
highly, highly encourage you,

32
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.010
to get involved in the community.

33
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.040
And not just the Spring community,

34
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.000
but get involved in your local development community.

35
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.050
Start a Java user group, join a Java user group,

36
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.040
start a Spring user group, get involved

37
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.090
because you may find that being involved in the community

38
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.070
gives you a lot more value

39
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.080
than any job search sites you can find,

40
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.040
because people are going to know who you are.

41
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.040
Now, I also encourage you to start preparing now

42
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
for the next upgrade, we know it's coming.

43
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.020
That's the beauty of open-source software

44
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.060
is it's always moving.

45
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.070
So, start reading the Spring blogs

46
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.090
and look at where they're going.

47
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.020
Get engaged with the Spring committers

48
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.010
and the Spring leads on Twitter and find out their thoughts

49
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.040
on where they're taking the next thing.

50
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.020
If you need to know who to follow, go see who I'm following

51
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.000
because a lot of those people are engaged and pivotal.

52
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.060
Also make your voice heard.

53
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.060
If there are things you want to see in the platform, add it.

54
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.020
If there are things you want to see in boot or framework

55
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.090
or wherever it's at within the Spring umbrella,

56
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.080
add it to the JIRA, make your voice heard.

57
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.070
You have to remember that everything in Spring--

58
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.070
Spring Boot was based on a ticket.

59
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.080
Everything comes from the feedback of the community,

60
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.010
so be that next champion.

61
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.030
I also encourage you to connect with me.

62
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.030
You can follow me on Twitter or Stack Overflow,

63
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.090
or follow me on LinkedIn.

64
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.040
My commitment does not end when this course ends,

65
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.010
and these media allow me to connect with all of you.

66
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.020
If you have questions about how to solve things

67
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.010
in the actual course,

68
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.060
or how to do things, reach out to me on these platforms.

69
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.030
There's no way for me to know

70
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.080
that you need help if you don't ask,

71
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.010
and I'm always willing to help you

72
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.030
about things around my content

73
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.060
or high-level constructs within Spring,

74
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.070
or any software development.

75
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.090
Finally, I want to thank you

76
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.070
for spending your time with me throughout this course.

77
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.070
Your time is valuable, and I know that.

78
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.010
And it does mean a lot to me

79
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.000
when I hear feedback from people,

80
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.090
that they enjoyed my course,

81
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.010
or that they learned something new from me.

82
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.050
That really is what drives me

83
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.060
to continue to produce this content.

84
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.060
So thank you for taking the time,

85
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.080
and please provide me the feedback that I need

86
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.000
to make these courses even better for you.
