00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.050
- Now there was another change in the Spring framework

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.070
that deals with XML configuration changes.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.060
And if you're still using XML for configuration,

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.080
you're in luck, it's still supported in Spring 5,

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.090
but there have been a few changes

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.020
that streamline the versioning.

7
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.080
If you don't provide a versioning,

8
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.070
you're going to get the latest XSD resolved

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.070
and version-specific declarations are now validated

10
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.030
against the latest XSD and not necessarily

11
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.090
the version that's provided.

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.080
And that's a big change from how we traditionally did

13
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.060
namespaces in XML for Spring configuration.

14
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.070
Now no judgment here, but I wouldn't be doing you a service

15
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.090
if I didn't ask the question of why.

16
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.070
Why would you still be using XML at this point?

17
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.090
Java config has been out and vetted for quite awhile.

18
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.000
Component scanning has been out and vetted for quite awhile.

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.040
And with Spring Boot and auto-config

20
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.060
there's really no reason to be using XML,

21
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.010
especially for code that you're writing.

22
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.030
If you've got code still depending on XML,

23
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.020
now's the time to make the conversion.

24
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.020
You're going to be upgrading to Spring 5 or Spring 2.0,

25
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.060
get rid of the XML.

26
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000
It's time.

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's move to the modern age and let's go to Java config.
