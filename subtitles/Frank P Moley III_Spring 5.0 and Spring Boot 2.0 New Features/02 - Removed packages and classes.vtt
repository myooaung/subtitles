00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.030
As with any major version upgrade

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.000
you've got to expect some removal of constructs and packages

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.070
within the library because this is the opportunity

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.040
that developers have to remove that deprecated code,

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.050
and Spring is not different.

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.000
One of the first things that we're going to notice

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.060
is the BeanFactoryLocator, which comes from the package

8
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.020
beans.factory.access has been actually removed.

9
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.050
Now this happens a lot of times

10
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.080
with layered application contexts.

11
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.010
A lot of times we see this interior architectures

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.050
of EJB applications.

13
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.030
Now the solution to this problem is really a couple options.

14
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.020
First, and the one that I would choose,

15
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.030
is to move away from EJBs.

16
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.010
That's not to always possible,

17
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.070
but if you leverage EJB 3.1, you can use CDI,

18
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.070
which should replace the need for the BeanFactoryLocators.

19
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.050
NativeJdbcExtractors were also removed in Spring 5.0.

20
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.030
This comes from the package jdbc.support.nativejdbc.

21
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.070
This was used to extract native objects

22
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.010
from the JDBC abstraction.

23
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.050
Things like raw connections, native result sets, etc.

24
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.040
The construct that has now been provided,

25
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070
is the connection.unwrap() method,

26
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.080
and I encourage you to look at that within the package.

27
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.040
The next change comes from removing the

28
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.000
AnnotationDrivenStaticEntityMockingControl.

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.030
Now this is something that was used for static mocks

30
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
and, to be honest, it's not something I've ever used.

31
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.050
It was used to aspect static entry of mock support in tests.

32
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.090
There are many other libraries

33
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.040
you can do to do this same thing.

34
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.020
So it's no longer supported,

35
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.090
but if you can find a library

36
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.000
that isn't being kept up-to-date with the latest JDK,

37
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.010
you can use that for those static mocks.

38
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.030
Now this really applies only to test compile-time aspecting

39
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.060
and we're not going to get into that

40
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.020
throughout the rest of the course.

41
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.040
Just know that this was a change.

42
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.070
Now there were several major version upgrades

43
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.030
with common web components, as well as back-end components.

44
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.000
If you're using tiles, Tiles 2 is removed,

45
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.020
and now you should be using Tiles 3.

46
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.040
If you're using Hibernate, 3 and 4 were both removed

47
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.090
in favor of Hibernate 5.

48
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.010
A lot of times when you're doing JPA development

49
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.060
you're using Spring Data JPA,

50
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.060
you may not even know

51
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.080
that you're using Hibernate behind the scenes,

52
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.040
and you're going to get Hibernate 5 out of the box.

53
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.080
But if you are using Hibernate natively,

54
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.030
make sure you upgrade to Hibernate 5.

55
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.050
Now there's been several contracts

56
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.030
that have been fully removed.

57
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.050
Portlets are gone.

58
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.020
Velocity template rendering is gone much to my chagrin.

59
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.090
I liked Velocity template rendering,

60
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.090
especially when dealing with email templates

61
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.000
for internal applications.

62
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.050
JasperReports are also gone and XMLBeans are gone.

63
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.070
Java Data Objects from the Java object persistence are gone,

64
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.020
and Guava support is no longer available.

65
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.090
A couple additional changes per the documentation

66
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.050
are listed and I encourage you to go read those.

67
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.010
There were many other deprecated classes

68
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.010
that were removed across the codebase,

69
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.050
and some compromises were made for commonly used methods

70
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.080
that may have been deprecated.

71
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.010
So again refer to the documentation for a lot of these.

72
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.060
These are just high-level changes

73
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.000
that have occurred across the platform as whole.
