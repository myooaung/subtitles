00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Instructor] So just like we saw with Spring 5.0,

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.080
Spring Boot 2.0 had some pretty significant library changes,

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.020
many of which actually rely on Spring 5.

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.080
The JDK is one of those situations.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.060
So Spring 2 now relies on the underlying changes

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.080
to Spring 5, and as such, JDK 8 is required.

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.080
JDK 9 support came out of the box when it was released.

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.070
JDK 10 and JDK 11 are supported along the same line.

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.010
I would encourage you because JDK 8

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.050
is now deprecated that JDK has 11 out as is 9 and 10.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.080
Do all of your work going forward with JDK 11.

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.070
So, as we've noted Spring 5 is now required,

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.080
so that is one of the major upgrades.

14
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.050
And as such, any time you upgrade your application

15
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.010
from Spring Boot, say 1.5.4 to 2.0.4

16
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.030
or whatever the latest version

17
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.060
is now, you're going to have to take into account

18
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.090
the fact that Spring has changed as well.

19
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.030
So you made need to make changes

20
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.010
to the construct itself during this upgrade.

21
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.000
And all of the library upgrades really fall in line

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030
with that upgrade to Spring 5.

23
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.090
The core library, for instance,

24
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.010
Tomcat 8.5 is now the default embedded

25
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.000
Tomcat web server for Spring Boot web.

26
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.060
9 is supported through a property change,

27
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.050
Flyway 5 if you're doing database migrations,

28
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.030
Hibernate 5.2 if you're doing JPA,

29
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.040
and Thymeleaf 3 if you're doing HTML view templates

30
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.010
which are all things that we would normally

31
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.030
use within an application, maybe not so much Flyway,

32
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.090
but that just depends on where you're at.

33
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.050
Now, one thing I want to note about the rest

34
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.050
of this chapter, I'm not going to go

35
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.010
into actually showing you a lot of the details

36
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.070
of how Spring Boot changes have occurred.

37
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
And the reason for that is I have an entire course

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.050
in the LinkedIn Learning Library

39
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.060
called Spring Boot Essentials 2.0.

40
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.050
And this is really designed to show you

41
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.050
how to use Spring Boot, but to use it in a 2.0 world.

42
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.030
I have a similar course out there for 1.5.x.

43
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.050
So take a look at that if you really want to

44
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.080
get more in depth.

45
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.030
I'm going to provide a very high-level overview

46
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.070
of what is changed.

47
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
Again, so if you want code, go look at that other course.

48
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.020
This is just high-level changes.

49
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.060
And if you're currently using Spring Boot.

50
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.020
This should really be just a primer

51
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.000
of what you may need to look at to make changes.
