- [Frank] Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.020
I am a software developer and architect

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.010
who has spent many years of my career

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.000
working with the Spring Framework.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.040
I have been involved in many open-source software projects

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.050
and very few, in my opinion, work as well

7
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.020
as the maintainers of the Spring Framework.

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.080
Working with open-source software is one

9
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.030
of the most exciting aspects of being a software developer.

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.030
Every single day, I get to work with some

11
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.010
of the brightest software engineers in the industry.

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.020
I get to work with the software that they write

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.040
and contribute back to their projects as a peer.

14
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.050
What really gets cool

15
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.080
is when the open-source project maintainers

16
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.030
listen to the feedback of their users and collaborators

17
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.060
and respond by making their projects even better.

18
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.020
Come join me in my LinkedIn Learning course

19
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.030
on the latest features of the Spring 5 Framework

20
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.010
and Spring Boot 2.0 and see why I believe Spring

21
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.020
continues to be the best framework available

22
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.000
for the Java developer today.
