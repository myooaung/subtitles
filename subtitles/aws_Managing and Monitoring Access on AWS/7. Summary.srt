[Autogenerated] Now that we are at the end of this module,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,620
let me finally rip up all the topics we have discussed so far in

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,030
this model we have explored AWS I am policies,

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,390
objects which provides a set of tools to regulate access to

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,840
AWS resources in a very granular way.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,330
Remember, with the policy,

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,450
you can see who does Watson given a set of conditions and most important,

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,840
the policy are perfectly coupled with AWS resources,

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,380
meaning that you have proper semantics to build the policy.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,440
Taylor, the toe well defined the results is off a specific AWS a service.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,250
Finally,

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,930
it is worth observing that aws I am policy are able to

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:56,000
possibly cover near all use cases that you can find one working in real world aws cloud environment.
