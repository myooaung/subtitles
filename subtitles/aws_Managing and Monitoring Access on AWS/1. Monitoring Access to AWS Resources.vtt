[Autogenerated] monitoring access to AWS resources.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.440
This chapter is the natural compression off the whole

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.950
course and provides your set of tools to ensure proper

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.610
governance off your AWS account.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.950
In this section, we're going to investigate AWS Tools,

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.740
which tracks success to AWS account and allows for monitoring and log in.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.230
We will concentrate on two main topics.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.170
Help the log activity performed on your AWS account and how to create a report

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.770
which described the usage of credentials across AWS account.

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.340
Let's start with Club Trail.

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.580
AWS Cloud Trail is in need of Leah service that helps you enable governance,

12
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.740
compliments and operational and risk auditing off your AWS account.

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.480
And this is straightforward.

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.730
Cloud trail is little which allowed to convey logging

15
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.940
activity down on AWS services of your account.

16
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.470
Action taken by a user role or an AWS service are

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.540
recorded as events in cloud trail,

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.750
so Cloud Trail can record all action on any AWS services

19
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.640
performed by user roles or services.

20
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.380
Events includes action taking in AWS management console,

21
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.590
AWS Common Lane interface and AWS sdk and AP eyes.

22
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.230
The trail is able to log events of regardless,

23
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.020
the tool used to perform the day action and this should remind you something.

24
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.140
When a policy is associated to a user,

25
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.520
the user can perform allowed actions regardless the tool used Console Seelye,

26
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.310
Sdk or FBI.

27
00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.440
Let me provide now more detail on a typical workflow involving cloud trail.

28
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.780
Everything starts with global Mantex AWS account.

29
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.700
When clothed trail is created,

30
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.990
all events performed on AWS services are logged as management events

31
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.410
which are represented by administrative actions,

32
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.890
for example, create a bark.

33
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.640
It started an 82 machine and so on, also for a subset of services.

34
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.330
At the time of writing astri and longer services,

35
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.740
Cloud Trail is able to record the data events.

36
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.940
For example, when love the function is started.

37
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.770
When data enters the bark it and so on by default cloud

38
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.500
trays log are starting single est Reebok it encryption at

39
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.940
rest is enabled by default.

40
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.740
Now we'll see that the logs starred in target s tree bark.

41
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.970
It are not so user friendly.

42
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.360
Luckily, Amazon allows for streaming the cloud trade logs into cloudwatch logs,

43
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.740
which is definitely easier to read and to interact with.

44
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.280
You should just remember that streaming cloud tree logs into

45
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.830
cloudwatch logs will cost you some money?

46
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:20.000
No, let us go for some demos, which, as usual, are organized as a scenario description and a task to be performed.
