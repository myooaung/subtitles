1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.710
[Autogenerated] managing the root user.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:10.770
Let's no see some action with AWS cloud environment and is them.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.740
We simulate global Mantex scenario where you receive credential for a fresh AWS

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.740
account about a your CEO and you must securely manage it.

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.040
We will see the following topics.

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.140
What is two factor authentication and how to manage for the rooty user?

7
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.010
How to disable access keys for the route users and how to

8
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.140
stop password policy for I am users.

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.640
Now let me provide more details on multi factor authentication.

10
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.440
Multi factor authentication is a security strategy where you have your

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.050
password and you have a token and the combination off.

12
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.340
The two can validate your identity.

13
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.530
A token can be a hardware token,

14
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.560
which is a physical device preferred where you have

15
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.240
strong security requirements.

16
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.940
Harder tokens are in vulnerable to malicious attacks,

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.550
and Amazon recommends them to secure your route user on the other side,

18
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.960
Softer talking consists in an app which most of time

19
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.140
is installed on your smartphone.

20
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.550
They are generally considered less secure and generally used to secure.

21
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.300
I am users among a wide range of multi factor authentication.

22
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.540
Strategy is we're going to investigate little more the

23
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.650
universal second Factor authentication, which has recently gained momentum.

24
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.240
It is an open standard which strengthens and

25
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.260
simplifies two factor authentication.

26
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.230
Using specialized universal sale bus cards.

27
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.850
It provides a strong two factor authentication,

28
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.000
which protects against fishing session _________ men

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.080
in the middle and malware stocks.

30
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.540
They are very easy to use.

31
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.260
They worked out of the box that,

32
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.720
thanks to native supporting platforms and browsers,

33
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.940
including chrome opera and Mozilla,

34
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.400
no code to type A or driver to install a universal two factor security Cajun.

35
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.040
Every new pairs of key for every service and only

36
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.040
the services store the public e.

37
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.870
With this approach,

38
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.150
no secrets are shared between service providers and an affordable,

39
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.050
universal two factor security.

40
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.870
He can support any number off services.

41
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.240
It is a cost efficient,

42
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.860
since user can choose from a wide range off affordable devices.

43
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.440
And you because is the brand leader now on the market?

44
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.040
The demo as being run with you be key, which costs around $25.

45
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.640
Now let's do some action on AWS account.

46
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.120
First thing to note is that you have separate entry points for the

47
00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.030
root user and for the I am users as discussed on Lee.

48
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.580
The root user is now over label.

49
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.120
My AWS account is already in place and credential a story in the browser.

50
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.840
All I have to do is to seinen let me click on I Am service and here we go.

51
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.680
There is some stuff you should not here First.

52
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.540
I am is not related to specific region,

53
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.240
but its configuration can be considered as a global configuration.

54
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.100
Second,

55
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.310
you have specifically where the I am user can second in it

56
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.340
contains your account I D and can also be customized.

57
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.170
For example, let's choose treatable name for it.

58
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.940
Then we can observe that hours security status and needs some attention.

59
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.180
As stated by AWS Gate Lines, we have five issues to be fixed.

60
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.620
Let's start with access keys as already discussed,

61
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.520
that if an access key has been generated for the root user,

62
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.340
it must be deleted.

63
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.730
Please note that the lesson must be preferred over the activation.

64
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.580
Since addictive ated key can be reactivated back,

65
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.070
let's no move to multi factor authentication.

66
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.420
Selected the device type for the root user with select you to F.

67
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.140
U B key device.

68
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.210
We are prompted to insert our you Becky and press on the

69
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.580
golden button on top of the token, and this is done em.

70
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.140
FAA is enabled.

71
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.220
Let's verify it.

72
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.280
Let me look out and looking back after heaven provided the

73
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.940
user name and password for my root account.

74
00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.230
I am prompted to insert my you Becky, and here I am back in my AWS account.

75
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.640
Finally, let's create apostles policy.

76
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.640
Following best practise for possible policies implies,

77
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.290
use at least eight characters, requires at least an upper case.

78
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.800
Enable password expiration time.

79
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.240
Allow the user to modify their own password and prevent for password reuse.

80
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.140
Once these configuration is applied,

81
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:40.000
you can see that we managed to fix three out of five issues related toe our AWS account.
