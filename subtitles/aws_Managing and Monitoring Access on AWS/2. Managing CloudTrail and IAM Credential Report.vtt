00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:06.220
[Autogenerated] Let's no focus on a set of dams which demonstrate aws stools,

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.640
which enables the monitoring off AWS account.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.150
As an 80 administrator,

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.710
you're asked to log all activity performed on AWS Club romantics.

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.520
Account looks must be securely stored in EST Reebok.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.740
It also you must ensure that logs are tamper evident and finally the

7
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.090
logs must be streamed in a user friendly format.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.540
Let's start with the club trail dashboard.

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.330
We create a new trail, provide a meaningful name regarding management event.

10
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.840
We decide that we want both read and write events to be recorded.

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.040
We choose for the sake of simplicity not to log key aim s events.

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.640
We skip inside events here.

13
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.540
He should also be aware that enabling this function will cost addiction.

14
00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.700
Aled money.

15
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.150
Regarding that, I Vance,

16
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.780
we enable logging for all present and future buckets

17
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.540
enabled on the current account.

18
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.210
Now we create a new back.

19
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.240
It we're all cloud trade logs and will be stored.

20
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.740
We enable lock validation as requested by the scenario and keep

21
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.340
the notification disabled for the moment.

22
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.510
Once covered trail has been created.

23
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.980
There is a final conflict to be done.

24
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.440
We specify that cloud Trey logs will be streamed to cloud wash logs.

25
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.170
And you should not be surprised that for these we need to

26
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.740
specify a role and an attached to the policy.

27
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.440
Now, using airless profile, we simulate an industry event.

28
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.640
We read all s three buckets and upload an object to a specific back it.

29
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.000
Then we moved to Cloud Wash logs without the 4th 15 minutes of delay.

30
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.480
The event generated by Ellis Action is recorded and streamed the two

31
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.840
cloudwatch log group created for this purpose.

32
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.470
When we open the event log element,

33
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.530
we can confirm that this is generated by Ellis Uploading file

34
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.470
on S three bucket As an 80 Administrator,

35
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.390
you're asked it.

36
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.080
Log all activity performed on AWS account and on a tear.

37
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.040
The party AWS account, which has been recently acquired by Global Mantex.

38
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.290
After the acquisition,

39
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.240
you are responsible to ensure governance for both accounts.

40
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.800
Logs coming from different account must be stored in

41
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.880
the same as three storage bucket.

42
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.220
To be able to satisfy this scenario,

43
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.440
we need to modify cloud trail target history back it.

44
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.840
Let us move to permission tub and let me outline which grant

45
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.910
access to a new folder identified by AWS account i d off the

46
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.040
company acquired by global Mantex.

47
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.980
Now we switch to the other account We create a new trail and

48
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.120
specified the already existing astri back it as target for these

49
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.840
new trail back to our primary account.

50
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.970
We see that a new folder as being created this folder will

51
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.400
receive all logs originated by Global.

52
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.720
Mantex acquired the company as an 80 administrator,

53
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.640
you're asked to provide a report which logs use age off AWS I am

54
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.590
credentials across your organization and is them we leverage on I am

55
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:52.670
tool to perform this task AWS I am makes a powerful tool of the label

56
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.350
Tow us to track down use age of credentials credential Report feature

57
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.690
is very easy to use.

58
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.330
It generates a report in comma separated values as you can see for all,

59
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.740
users were able to see when credentials has bean created and used.

60
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.560
Now we see that for root user we have aws access

61
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.380
keys enabled and if you remember,

62
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.440
we have enabled them when working with a stree MF a delete feature.

63
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.760
So let me looking as rooty user and disable access keys as

64
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:44.000
you can see now in I am main dashboard, all five items are green again, meaning that we have correctly secured our road user
