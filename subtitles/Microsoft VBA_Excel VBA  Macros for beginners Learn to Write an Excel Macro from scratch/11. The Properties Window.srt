1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
Okay,

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,120
I So now we're going to speak about the properties window.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,310
So the properties window enables us to it.

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,410
It the properties of whatever object we select from our Project Explorer.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:11,940
Okay,

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,450
so this is the properties window.

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,750
Now we can view the properties window by going to the view menu here at the top and

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,250
clicking on Properties Window.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,330
And alternatively,

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,610
we can click on F four on our keyboard.

11
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,040
Okay,

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,380
so now if I select module one,

13
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,460
you can see here that the only property I couldn't edit is actually the name of the module

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,460
.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,920
Now,

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,360
if I select cheat One,

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,120
for instance,

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,050
here he can see here that I can also modify its name.

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,520
And it can also enable calculations or disabled them enable of format conditions,

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,260
calculations and other things.

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,460
So you can see how I can get a different properties off the sheet.

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,200
I can enable or disable pivot tables as well.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,570
We've got different properties that weaken edit here on the worksheet.

24
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,460
And you can see here that there are two ways of actually arranging the properties,

25
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,640
either in an alphabetic way or in a categories way.

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,420
Okay,

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,670
so you can see here we can either arrange them in alphabetic order or put them into into

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,590
different categories.

29
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,960
But here,

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,210
actually,

31
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,270
we've got only one category for the worksheet object.

32
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,220
But actually,

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,120
both these stabs contained the same properties.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,570
It's just that they are arranged differently.

35
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,420
Now,

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,420
if I select this workbook,

37
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,790
you can see here that the workbook has mawr properties to be modified than the worksheet.

38
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,740
And of course,

39
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,400
they are also arranged in two different ways either alphabetic or categories.

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,690
But both ways actually have the same properties.

41
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,120
Now,

42
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,280
if you need to change any other properties here on the properties window,

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,880
you can just go in and change it so you can go in and type,

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,770
for example,

45
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,870
changed the name often object,

46
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,050
or you consider act something formal dropped on menu here.

47
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,490
Okay,

48
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,280
so this is how you can change the properties of an object.

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,000
But actually,

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,590
most of the changes that were going to do to object properties were going to do them

51
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,420
through the code window through writing VB a code.

52
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,130
Okay.

53
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,940
And we will be discussing the code window on the next lesson.
