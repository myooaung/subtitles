1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,210
Hey,

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,510
guys,

3
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,160
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,140
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,050
we're going to speak about this.

6
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,470
Sells collection,

7
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,000
object.

8
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,730
So the cells collection object is a collection object that allows us to deal with cells

9
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,860
just like the range object.

10
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,470
However,

11
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:22,150
we do that in a different way because instead of providing the name of the cell like a one

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,100
a two b one b two c three,

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:31,530
we actually provide the row number and the column number for the cell.

14
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,960
Because the intersection of a certain row and a certain column I would give us a cell.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,750
Right?

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,630
So this is how we deal with the cells collection object.

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,810
Instead of providing the name of the cell,

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,090
we actually provide the row number and the column number for the cell.

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,040
Okay,

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,130
so let's have an example here,

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,650
suggests a I right cells.

22
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,920
And then I opened some brackets,

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,950
okay.

24
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,570
And you can see here we've got to imports the row index and the column index,

25
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,250
and actually,

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,550
they are both optional because you can see they have got square brackets around them.

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,510
However,

28
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,940
we actually need to input the row index and the column index because this is the only way

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,650
to refer to a certain cell.

30
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,020
And even though they are optionally needs,

31
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,940
you need to be impotent because if you don't import them,

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,190
then you're referring to all the cells in your sheet.

33
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,350
So,

34
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,950
for example,

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,810
for right cells don't select it with or without the brackets.

36
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,110
This will actually select all the cells in my sheet,

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,150
as you can see here.

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,980
So back to our cells collection objects.

39
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,130
So if I write sells one comma,

40
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,920
two duck value equals 50.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,400
So this will actually put the value of 50 in the cell that is in the first row.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,160
And in this second column,

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,190
that means is gonna be Selby one.

44
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,040
So if you run,

45
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,610
that can see here,

46
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,950
the Selby one has acquired the value off 50.

47
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,810
So basically,

48
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,360
as you've seen here,

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,650
we needed to specify which sell we needed to deal with,

50
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,620
because the cells collection object contains all the cells.

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,060
So when use it,

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,690
if you need to deal with a certain cell,

53
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,060
you need to actually specify which sell you are dealing with.

54
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,520
What more thing I'd like to tell you about the cells collection object is that you're

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,880
dealing with cells just like what you were doing when you were using the range object.

56
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,730
So actually,

57
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,210
most of the methods on properties that we've explained when we were explaining the range

58
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,960
object are actually going to be applicable to the cells collection object as well,

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,940
because at the end of the day,

60
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,900
you're also dealing with cells,

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,400
right?

62
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,050
So because both the range object and the cells collection object the deal with cells,

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,410
they will have the same methods on properties.

64
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,450
Okay,

65
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:18,570
so someone would ask a question here if the cells collection object does the same thing as

66
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,840
the range object which is dealing with cells,

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,130
why would we bother to learn about it?

68
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,640
So actually,

69
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,590
in the future,

70
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:33,830
when we learn about variables which are basically containers of data so each variable can

71
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,950
contain some data and this data could be a number,

72
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,610
you could have a variable X here in the row number in the cells collection object with Roe

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,210
index,

74
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,730
and this variable could have its value changing,

75
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,830
especially if you're using a loop,

76
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,580
for example,

77
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,230
and a loop is basically you can think about it as laps around a track or rotations around

78
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:00,850
the track.

79
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,850
So in the first rotation,

80
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,070
the value of X could be one.

81
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,890
And then on the second rotation,

82
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,040
the value of X could be,

83
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,570
too.

84
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,600
And then on the third rotation,

85
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,590
the value of X could be three and so on and so forth.

86
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,280
And actually,

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,920
when the value of exchanges this means that you will be dealing with different cells,

88
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,270
right,

89
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,320
goes sells.

90
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,160
One comma,

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,650
too,

92
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,650
is different than cells to calm a two.

93
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,860
And that's different than sells three comma two right?

94
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,350
So when the value of exchanges the cell that you're dealing with changes.

95
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,370
So basically the fact that the cells collection object except numbers and you can plug in

96
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,860
variables in the cells collection object,

97
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,540
this gives it a lot of power,

98
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,320
and this will be clearer.

99
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,760
Actually,

100
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,850
as we progress through the course and when we reach the variable section,

101
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,250
we explain variables.

102
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:01,070
But I just wanted to highlight the power and the potential off the cells collection object

103
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,070
.

104
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,210
It is truly powerful.

105
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,840
One more thing I'd like to tell you about this sells collection object is that you can

106
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,340
actually input the column index as the column letter.

107
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,090
So instead of importing the number for the column,

108
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,910
you could put the letter for the calm.

109
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,070
So,

110
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,800
for example,

111
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,610
if I write cells one comma,

112
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,080
see?

113
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,820
But you actually need to write the letter in between double quotes,

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,950
this will refer to cell C one.

115
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,650
Okay,

116
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,690
so if I run that he could see her.

117
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,450
That cell C one has been given the value off 50.

118
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,750
Okay,

119
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,320
Okay,

120
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,170
I So that's it for the introduction to the cells collection object.

121
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,530
We will speak more about it in depth as we progress through the course.

122
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,150
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see you in the next one.
