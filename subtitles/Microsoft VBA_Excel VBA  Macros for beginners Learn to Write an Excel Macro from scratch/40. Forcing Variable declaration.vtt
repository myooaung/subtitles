00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
Hagos,

2
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.480
welcome back.

3
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.630
So on the previous video,

4
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.370
we have seen how weaken declare variables.

5
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.730
And we've also seen a demonstration off the different variable data types.

6
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.780
We have also discussed the debate on the Internet between two groups of people where

7
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.600
actually one group are not a fan of variable declaration.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.130
And they say it's not important to declare your variables in XlV B.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.070
A and the other group say that variable declaration is an absolute must and that you must

10
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.130
declare each and every variable on your procedures.

11
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.500
So one of the ways that the second group,

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.430
the people who are saying that variable declaration is an absolute must one of the ways

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.600
that this group used to force themselves to declare variables is to actually right at the

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.750
top off a module option explicit.

15
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.910
And what option explicit does is that it forces variable declaration in that particular

16
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.460
module that you would write it in.

17
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.100
And that means that if any sir procedure or any macro in that particular module has a

18
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.950
variable that is not declared,

19
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.600
the macro will not run,

20
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.850
you've got an error.

21
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.240
So,

22
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.250
for example,

23
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.560
on this macro here that we created on the previous lesson where we demonstrated running a

24
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.720
macro without having variables declared.

25
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.400
And we've demonstrated that very in data type,

26
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.040
because here at the moment,

27
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.650
Bolivar is equal to Jack.

28
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.490
So this variable my var is not declared.

29
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.550
We haven't written the line of code that says dim.

30
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.360
I've are as whatever data type we want it to be.

31
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.550
So right now,

32
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.390
if I try to run this macro,

33
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.700
I will get a Knerr er variable not defined.

34
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.590
So this is what option explicit,

35
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.460
written at the top of the module.

36
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.430
Does it forces variable declaration.

37
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.600
And if any variable is not declared,

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.880
the marker will not run on.

39
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.250
Please note that he needs to be written at the top of the module.

40
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.420
It cannot be written inside.

41
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.660
A certain sir procedure,

42
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.180
for example,

43
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.170
needs to be written outside of also procedures and at the top of the module.

44
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.850
And please note as well that if I declare my var as variant,

45
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.630
the module will run.

46
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.310
Okay,

47
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.180
so run absolutely fine as long as you declare as something even if it's as variant.

48
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.750
But if you don't declare it at all,

49
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.950
that's when you get an error.

50
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:51.130
Another thing that the second group of people do to force variable declaration is that they

51
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.330
would have each and every module that they would create,

52
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.070
having option explicit on it.

53
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.680
So right now,

54
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.410
I have written option explicit right now.

55
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.080
But if I create a new module option,

56
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.570
explicit will not be written.

57
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.700
So if I want option explicit to be written at the top of each and every module that I

58
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.640
create,

59
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.620
what I need to do is to go to the Tools menu here at the top and then go to options and

60
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.100
then here,

61
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.100
under the editor top Aiken check.

62
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.910
Require variable declaration and click OK,

63
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.520
and now,

64
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.760
from that point,

65
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.950
each and every module the I create will have option explicit written at the top.

66
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.990
But if a module has already created,

67
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.060
it wants so here module to was already created,

68
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.680
it doesn't have option explicit at the top,

69
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.860
but if I create a new module,

70
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.480
it will have option explicit.

71
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.420
I'm personally not a fan off doing require variable declaration because sometimes I might

72
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:58.010
just write a short macro that I would even use ones so I would not declare the variables.

73
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.520
It's just something short that I just want to do quickly,

74
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.910
and I just saved myself some keystrokes and I just don't declare the variables and it just

75
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.840
do it that way.

76
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.070
That is not the best thing to do,

77
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.140
but this is what I personally do.

78
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.260
But usually I do declare my variables.

79
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.610
But sometimes if I just want to do something quickly,

80
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.670
I just write a macro like that without declaring the variables and it just do it.

81
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.390
Okay,

82
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.240
But it's really a personal thing if you want to be forced to declare variables each and

83
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.970
every time than just go to tools.

84
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.940
Options check record Variable Declaration.

85
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.210
Click OK on your set to go guy.

86
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.270
So it's a personal thing,

87
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.850
really,

88
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.850
and a difference between one V.

89
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.060
B.

90
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.150
A developer and another.

91
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.250
Okay,

92
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.440
so ah,

93
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.970
thank you guys for watching this video and I'll see on the next one
