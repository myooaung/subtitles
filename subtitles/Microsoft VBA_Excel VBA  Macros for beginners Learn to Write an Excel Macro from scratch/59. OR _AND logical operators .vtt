00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200
Hey,

2
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.500
guys,

3
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.130
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.250
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.560
we're going to discuss the and and the or logical operators in XlV A.

6
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.770
So the end and the or logical operators in XlV be a work exactly the same as the end and

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.100
the or functions in Excel in that only excel grid.

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.390
So as we know,

9
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.710
the and function will take some logical tests.

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.170
And if all the logical tests are true,

11
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.910
then it will you the true.

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.380
And if any of the logical tests is false,

13
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.790
then it will yield a false.

14
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.970
That's what the ad in function does.

15
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.760
And that's what the end logical operator in Excel VB a does and the or function in Excel

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.350
takes some logical tests.

17
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.160
And if any of the logical tests is true,

18
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.120
then he will yield a true and actually,

19
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.680
if all of them are false and this is the only case it would yield the false.

20
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.020
Then it's going to yield a false.

21
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.760
So if graded,

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.500
a simple macro here called and or and,

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.170
as you can see,

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.340
are,

25
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.720
um,

26
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.650
applying logical tests on Selby 21 that's colored in orange year.

27
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.800
And as you can see here,

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.420
the first test year.

29
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.930
The first,

30
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.500
if condition,

31
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.250
says,

32
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.970
if the value of Selby 21 is greater than or equal to one,

33
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.610
and its value is less than or equal to five.

34
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.900
So this is a condition,

35
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.430
and this is a condition,

36
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.000
and there is an and logical operator here.

37
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.060
So basically,

38
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670
in order for this whole,

39
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.270
if condition to yield,

40
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.110
a true this needs to be true.

41
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.060
And this part is,

42
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.350
well needs to be true.

43
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.700
And they will actually be true in our case here,

44
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.620
because Selby,

45
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.180
21 has a value of three,

46
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.290
which is greater than or equal to one,

47
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.810
and at the same time it's less than or equal to five.

48
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.220
So that means that if we execute this macro uber pressing F eight owner keyboard,

49
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.040
this if will yield a true and we're going to see this message boxes says between one and

50
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.670
five.

51
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.080
You can also add more than two logical tests for the and here,

52
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.070
so we can actually add to be 21.

53
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.710
Value does not equal to two,

54
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.650
for example,

55
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.980
so if range B 20 wonder values greater than or equal to one,

56
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.480
and it's less than or equal to five and at the same time as well is not equal to two.

57
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.200
So all these logical tests are going to yield a true So that means that the whole if will

58
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.120
be a true and we're going to get this message box.

59
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.950
However,

60
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.730
if any of these logical tests is false than the whole,

61
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.190
if will be false.

62
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.730
Okay?

63
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.520
Because in case of the end,

64
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.050
all the logical tests need to be true in order for the logical tests to be true.

65
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.800
So,

66
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.420
for example,

67
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.770
if we change this to be greater than or equal to 10 for example so when this logical test

68
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.150
is done,

69
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.190
this is going to feel the full,

70
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.390
so the whole if will be false.

71
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.110
So it's trying out here.

72
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.060
As you can see here,

73
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.340
it's gonna bypass it because it's shielded the false,

74
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.920
and this one also will you the false where the or one and we will speak about that shortly

75
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.920
.

76
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.280
But as you can see here for the end,

77
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.680
all the logical just needs to be true.

78
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.190
In order to yield a true and if any of them yields the force than all the logical s will be

79
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.730
false.

80
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.100
Now we're going to speak about the or logical operator.

81
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.300
So here we've got the second line of code here has an or logical operators.

82
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.330
It says else if range B 20 wonder value is equal to 10 or it is equal to 20.

83
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.420
If we make this a 10 than the fact that this will be true will make the whole else if true

84
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.030
as well.

85
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.860
Okay,

86
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.790
So in case of the or if any of the conditions you're testing is true,

87
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.050
then the whole logical test will be true.

88
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.040
Okay,

89
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.220
So if we run this macro because here we're gonna actually execute the message box for that

90
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.380
one because the else if will be true and that is because one of them is true.

91
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.100
Now,

92
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.750
the only case that this else if in this form will be false is that if both are actually

93
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.510
fall So if we change the value year to 11 and we're on the macro,

94
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.170
it will actually yield fools.

95
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.850
And the message box 10 or 20 will not be executed because the values neither equal to 10

96
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.290
nor equal to 20 as you can see her,

97
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:07.040
you can also mix between the or and the end in that case,

98
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.730
Actually,

99
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:16.280
it is preferable that you would put brackets for both readability and also for excel Toe.

100
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.670
Be able to understand what you want to do.

101
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.310
So,

102
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.890
for example,

103
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:28.820
if I write range B 21 value is equal to 10 or beat one to wonder values equal to 20 and B

104
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.550
21 is less than 30 and we change this actually to 10.

105
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.960
So in that case,

106
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.550
actually,

107
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.600
this will yield a true this whole thing,

108
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.010
will you?

109
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.560
The truth And this whole thing also will you two True,

110
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.790
Because the value is equal to 10 or equal to 22 this part will yield a true,

111
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.970
and the value is also less than 30.

112
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.020
And in that case,

113
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.360
actually,

114
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.540
this whole bunch,

115
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.470
which is too logical tests with an or logical is treated as as one logical test.

116
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.810
And this is treated.

117
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.340
There's another logical test,

118
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.100
and they're both being tested with an end logical operator.

119
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.460
So in this case,

120
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.650
it will actually yield the true.

121
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.300
And we'll have this message box 10 or 20 pop up.

122
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.730
So let's run the macro here.

123
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.520
Step by step.

124
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.240
You can see here They got the message box 10 or 20 popped up.

125
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.730
So if you're gonna mix between the end and the or it is preferable and highly advisable,

126
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:42.890
it's a good practice to put your tests between brackets for both readability and also to be

127
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.880
able to convey the message or what you need to do to XlV.

128
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.200
Be a correctly so to be able to convey your message correctly.

129
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.950
Okay,

130
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.830
so I hope that was informative for you guys.

131
00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.220
I hope he understood the difference between the end and the or logical operators were going

132
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.990
to use them quite a lot on the course.

133
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.580
Okay,

134
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.550
so thank you very much watching this video and we'll see on the next one.
