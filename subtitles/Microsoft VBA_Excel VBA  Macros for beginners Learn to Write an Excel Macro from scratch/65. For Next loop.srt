1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
Hey,

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,190
guys,

3
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,710
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,610
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,050
we're going to discuss the first type of loops,

6
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,090
which is the four next loop.

7
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,370
So the for next loop has a very simple structure,

8
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,230
which is for the value of a counter.

9
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,090
And this counter is gonna be a variable equal start,

10
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,590
which is gonna be asserting value.

11
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,470
Such is one,

12
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,240
for example,

13
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,200
to end,

14
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,900
which is gonna be an ending value such as 10.

15
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,770
So for X,

16
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,380
for example,

17
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,940
equals 1 to 10 we're gonna execute some code,

18
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,850
and then next counter,

19
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,100
which is next X,

20
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,950
for example.

21
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,920
So that means that X is going to take a value of one,

22
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,290
and then this code is going to be executed.

23
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,370
That's gonna be the first pass on.

24
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,030
Then when we reach the next X statement,

25
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,620
we're gonna go back and increment the value of X by one to become a two and then execute

26
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,220
the code.

27
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,530
And then we're gonna go to the next X statement and then go back again,

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,770
increment the value of X by one to become a three and then execute the code,

29
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,890
go to the next X statement and so on and so forth and we're going to keep on executing the

30
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,300
code until the value of X reaches the end value,

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,340
which is 10 for example.

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,810
Okay,

33
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,300
so when the value of X reaches 10 acts,

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,210
is going to take the value of 10 execute the code for the 10th time and then because it's

35
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,150
the n value.

36
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,300
When it reaches the next X statement,

37
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,640
it's not gonna go back.

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,660
It's just gonna execute any code below the four next loop.

39
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,110
So that is the structure of the for next loop.

40
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,340
And please note that the start and end values are going to determine how many times the

41
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,560
code in between is going to be executed in the upcoming videos as well.

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,870
We're going to learn about the exit for statement,

43
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:53,260
which is going to enable us to exit the for next loop at any point if a certain condition

44
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,730
is mad.

45
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:59,270
So we're going to learn as well how to exit the loop without depending on reaching the end

46
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,600
value for the count.

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,950
So let's see an example for the four next loop.

48
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,800
Okay,

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,030
guys.

50
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,220
So I've created a set procedure here,

51
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,540
cold for next loop,

52
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:18,170
and I'm gonna dim X as bite and then for X is equal to 1 to 10 Next X and then what we're

53
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,020
going to do is that we're gonna print the value of X in the immediate windows or debug dot

54
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,520
print.

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,080
Exe.

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,210
So this code,

57
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,930
what it's going to do is that it's going to give X the value of one at the beginning and

58
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,540
then print the value of X,

59
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,590
which is gonna be one.

60
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,340
And then it's going to go.

61
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,130
The next X statement is gonna increment the value of X by one to become a two on so on and

62
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,620
so forth.

63
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,420
So let's go through the coat together.

64
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,540
Basically,

65
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,950
the value of X is gonna be printed here in the immediate window.

66
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,320
So I'm going to go through the coat step by step here by pressing F eight on my keyboard.

67
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,940
And as you can see,

68
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,590
her first of all,

69
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,130
the value of X is equal to one.

70
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,850
As you can see her when we highlighting it is gonna print the value of X here,

71
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,510
which is gonna be one.

72
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:10,290
And then when it reaches an X X statement and because the value of X is still less than the

73
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,270
end value.

74
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,810
We're gonna go back an increment,

75
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,960
the value of X by one to become a two.

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,200
And then we're gonna print the value of X year.

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,720
And then we're gonna increment the value to become a three.

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,890
After reach the next X statement,

79
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,030
print it on.

80
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,520
If we keep doing that,

81
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,100
you can see here that the values of X have been printed tear at the bottom.

82
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,070
And after we reached the value of 10 here is the next X statement.

83
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,580
Now the value of X is a 10 as you can see here,

84
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,340
and we reach the next X statement.

85
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,380
So what's gonna happen?

86
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,720
We're not gonna go back.

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,690
We're gonna exit the loop because we've reached the end value for X and we've exited the

88
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,540
loop and we're gonna execute any code after the loop.

89
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,450
And at the moment,

90
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,020
Onley the end sub line happens to be the line after the code.

91
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,990
So we're gonna execute the ends up line here and just and the macro,

92
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,450
so that simply is the for next loop.

93
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,580
This is the simplest structure for the for next loop.

94
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,590
The value of X is incremental by one.

95
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,640
By default,

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,270
however,

97
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:22,190
we will see shortly how we can change the incremental value or the value that X is

98
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,270
incremental by.

99
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,830
So we could make it get implemented by to for examples,

100
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,020
it's gonna become 135 and we can increment backwards as well.

101
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,090
Like we can do a countdown.

102
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,410
So 10 86 we can do that as well.

103
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,480
We're going to see that shortly.

104
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,540
Another example that we can have year is actually using the cells collection object inside

105
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,850
the for next loop.

106
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,770
So,

107
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,780
as you can see here,

108
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,970
this is a four next loop for X equals 1 to 10.

109
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,010
The action that we're going to take or the code we're going to repeat is basically cells X

110
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,880
comma one equals X.

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,970
So at the beginning of the loop and on the first pass,

112
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,980
X is gonna be assigned a value of one.

113
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,280
So this is going to yield sells one comma,

114
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,150
one equals one.

115
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,660
This is gonna put the value of one and sell a one,

116
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,550
and then X is gonna be incriminated by one on the second pass.

117
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,260
So it's gonna be cells to calm a one equal stew,

118
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,230
so sell a two is going to be populated with the value of two.

119
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:31,650
And basically we're gonna fill the cells a 1 to 8 10 with the numbers 1 to 10 using this

120
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,050
coat.

121
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,860
And remember,

122
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,170
guys,

123
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,030
when we're speaking actually about the cells collection object and we said that is very

124
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,120
useful because it uses numbers instead of saying sell A to,

125
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,730
for example,

126
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,610
we specify the number for the road number and the column number for the cell.

127
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,280
So this is why the cells collection object is useful.

128
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,410
And we've spoken about that,

129
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,320
and here we're actually demonstrating how useful it is.

130
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,030
So if we run the code step by step here,

131
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,730
using F eight on our keyboard,

132
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,770
you can see here first of all,

133
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,560
X takes the value of one.

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,300
And because extrude the value of one,

135
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,940
you can see that the value of one is put in cell a one.

136
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,240
And then on the second past,

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,420
we're gonna get the value of to put in cell eight to And if we keep on pressing F eight on

138
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,020
our keyboard here,

139
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,970
the value of X Nolly stench is gonna go sell eight and put a 10.

140
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,330
And because we've reached the end value for our loop.

141
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,360
We're not going to loop again after the next X statement here,

142
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
we're gonna execute the following statement which is ends up.

143
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,330
So we're gonna exit our micro.

144
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,650
So it's another example actually of using the for next loop with the cells collection

145
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:47,730
object to loop through cells we're going to see as well how to look through cells using the

146
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,310
for each loop later on in the course.

147
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,330
But this is one way to look through cells.

148
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,470
There's another way which is using the for each loop as well.

149
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,140
OK,

150
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,410
guys.

151
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,450
So now we're gonna see how to change the increment ation value for our variable.

152
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,930
So we said that by default,

153
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,880
the value is incremental by one.

154
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,690
However,

155
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,680
we can change that value.

156
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,450
So here we're going to make our value get incremental by two.

157
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,430
So,

158
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,180
for example,

159
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,720
the first pass in this loop is gonna be X having the value of five.

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,930
And then the second pass is gonna be X,

161
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,210
having the value of seven,

162
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,270
therefore incremental by two on,

163
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,600
then the third pass is gonna be X,

164
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,840
having the value of mine and then 11 and then 13 and then 15 on how you change.

165
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,470
The implementation value is basically using using this step word to this step word controls

166
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,840
your incantation values.

167
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,180
So here we've written Step two and our value gets implemented by two.

168
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,950
If you're right three than the value is gonna be implemented by three and so on and so

169
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,400
forth.

170
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,240
So if we go through this code,

171
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,200
step by step here is here on the first pass the value of excess gonna be five.

172
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,150
And then when we reach the next X statement,

173
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,470
the values gonna be implemented by two sonar the value of excess.

174
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:03,930
Seven.

175
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,260
You can see here that the values printed here at the bottom seven and then nine and then

176
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:17,050
beloved and then 13 and then 15 and then when reached 15 we exit the loop on and sub.

177
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,840
Okay,

178
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,710
so this is how you can change the increment ation value.

179
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,970
You can also increment backwards.

180
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:32,750
So here for X equals 2 15 to 5 step negative two is gonna increment backwards or do a

181
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,590
countdown.

182
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,550
So basically,

183
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:41,920
X is going to take the value of 15 and then on the second pass is going to be 13 11 97

184
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,760
until we reach a value of five.

185
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,740
However,

186
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,800
I want to show you something,

187
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,330
actually,

188
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,630
because this is not gonna work with the variable type being a bite.

189
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:59,990
And the reason for that is that the bites value is between zero and 255 forgotten over flow

190
00:08:59,990 --> 00:08:59,990
.

191
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,250
And although the value of X is not gonna be outside the range of the bite,

192
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,940
actually,

193
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,480
I believe that the value of X is given a value of negative two,

194
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,460
which is outside the range for the bite.

195
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,130
So is given a value of negative too,

196
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,710
I think.

197
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,440
And then it's added to the current value of X.

198
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,520
So adding a negative to to a current value of X would just incremental backwards by

199
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,550
negative too.

200
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,310
But it doesn't work.

201
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,990
The bite does not work.

202
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,740
So it is better to do an interview in this case.

203
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,620
And then if we run this code,

204
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,410
we're going to actually have a countdown.

205
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,060
15 13 11 975 and then and sub.

206
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,930
Okay,

207
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:50,680
this is how you can control the increment ation value for your variable,

208
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,540
and you can do a negative value that is,

209
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,780
you can count down as well.

210
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,760
You can also do a decimal value for the incantation value.

211
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,480
But you need to make sure to change the data type for your variable to something that can

212
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,820
hold decimals because the inter jury cannot hold decimals.

213
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,520
So here we can do 15 to 5 with a step negative,

214
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,440
open five.

215
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,700
And that means that we're gonna count down by 1/2.

216
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,460
So 15 14.5 14 13.5 in this.

217
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,760
And it's a too long.

218
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,250
So I'm just gonna execute the macro straight away,

219
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,140
no step by step until we reach the value off five,

220
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,990
as you can see here.

221
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,880
And you can also do a positive decimal as well.

222
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,260
So if you make this just opened five and you make this 5 to 15 you can increment with a

223
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,950
step of positive or 150.5 as well.

224
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,910
Just make sure the you select the correct variable data cyp.

225
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,450
Okay,

226
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,360
so let's see it,

227
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,710
guys,

228
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,850
for the for next loop.

229
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,860
Thank you very much watching this video.

230
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,120
I know.

231
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,170
See you on the next one
