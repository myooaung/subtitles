1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
and this video,

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,310
we're going to see how we can move sheets using XlV b A.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,890
So to move sheets in xlv b A You could write the name of the worksheet,

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:18,650
so worksheets sheet one dot move and there is actually a before or after parameter that you

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,010
I need to put if you need to move it in the same workbook.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,380
OK,

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,790
so let's say work seat seat,

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,680
one dot move,

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,020
and then it's going to be put after calling equals worksheets.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,040
She too.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,540
Okay,

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,160
so this is gonna move sheet one to be put after she too.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,090
And that is to the right hand side of she too.

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:44,060
So if you run that you can see here that sheet one has been moved to be after she to or to

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,250
its right hand side.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,900
If you remove the before or after parameters,

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,970
what's gonna happen is that it's gonna be moved to a new workbooks in your workbook will be

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,460
created,

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,900
and sheet one is gonna be moved to it.

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,060
So if you run that,

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,320
you can see her sheet one has been moved to a new workbook.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,070
And then you could take that workbook,

23
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,020
Do whatever you want with it,

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,100
And we will learn about workbooks shortly in the course.

25
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,950
Okay.

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,140
So Ah,

27
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,130
thank you very much,

28
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:12,320
