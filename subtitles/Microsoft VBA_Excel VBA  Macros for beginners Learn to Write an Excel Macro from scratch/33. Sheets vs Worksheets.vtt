00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.230
Hey,

2
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.520
guys,

3
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.060
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.880
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.670
we're going to discuss the difference between the worksheets collection object and the

6
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.180
sheets collection object.

7
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.320
So basically,

8
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.580
the worksheets collection contains only the worksheets that we use often,

9
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.650
you know the regular type when you press the plus button.

10
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.400
This is the type of worksheets that get inserted by default.

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.280
Our if you right,

12
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.150
click on any sheet,

13
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.330
click on insert and click on worksheet and press.

14
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.910
OK,

15
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.370
this is the only type of work sheets or,

16
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.910
if she eats,

17
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.420
that is contained in the worksheets collection.

18
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.090
Okay,

19
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.240
however,

20
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.520
the sheets collection contains the other types as well.

21
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.470
So the chart and the macro sheets and international macro seasonal these sheets that we

22
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.400
don't use often.

23
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.800
Okay,

24
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.910
so that's may need the difference.

25
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.510
Actually,

26
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.850
the worksheets collection contains just this single type of worksheets,

27
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.820
but actually the sheets collection could things charge sheets,

28
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.910
macro sheets and these other types that we don't use often.

29
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.960
And to illustrate that with an example.

30
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.870
If you write worksheets dot ads and then on the type parameter,

31
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.670
we would write Excel Sheet type dot axel chart,

32
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.500
for example.

33
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.360
OK,

34
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.420
so actually,

35
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.910
the charge sheet is not one of the types that are part of the worksheets collection.

36
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.100
So if you run that,

37
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.150
you will get an error.

38
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.480
And actually it is a bit weird that there is actually a type parameter in the worksheets

39
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.060
collection.

40
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.270
Because if you think about it,

41
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.140
the worksheets collection contains only one type,

42
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.050
and there is no need to put a type parameter right.

43
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.830
At least that's what I think.

44
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.180
So I mean,

45
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.330
this parameters,

46
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.300
in my opinion,

47
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.410
should not exist.

48
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.450
But oh,

49
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.850
well,

50
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.690
okay,

51
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.350
so if you actually change the worksheet start,

52
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.710
Adam,

53
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.990
make it just sheets,

54
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.800
start ad and run that you actually have a chart sheet inserted.

55
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.180
So this actually illustrates that actually,

56
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.450
the charge sheet is part off the sheets collection.

57
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.220
One more thing I want to tell you as well is that when inserting a sheet,

58
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.770
you could actually omit the actual Excel sheet type.

59
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.190
This is a constant.

60
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.620
You can omit it,

61
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.010
actually,

62
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.380
and right,

63
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.750
just type equals excel chart.

64
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.850
And this will enable you to insert a charge sheet as well.

65
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.700
But the Excel sheet type enables you to have a drop down with she types of the different

66
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.410
she types.

67
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.640
So it is better,

68
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.910
I believe to write it because this will enable you to have a list.

69
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.850
And you won't need to memorize the difference.

70
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.120
She types how they're written.

71
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.950
So okay,

72
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.800
to illustrate the difference even more,

73
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.320
we're gonna use the sheet,

74
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.250
start counts property.

75
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.960
We're gonna put it inside a message box.

76
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.790
And actually,

77
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.250
I'm gonna comment this line of code as well so that it wouldn't be executed.

78
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.150
And now,

79
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.850
if you run that macro here,

80
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.270
you're gonna four.

81
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.310
And the reason is that Excel is counting all the she types because the sheets collection

82
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.990
object contains all the she types.

83
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.870
So the regular worksheets that we use and the chart sheets as well we've got four in total

84
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.190
here.

85
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.220
Now,

86
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.720
if you actually run the message box was worksheets.

87
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.740
Stock counts.

88
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.590
You'll see here that we get a two on Lee because it's only counting the regular type of

89
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.170
worksheets that we use,

90
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.470
which is sheet one and C two.

91
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.040
This is why we're getting it to OK,

92
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.780
so this is basically the difference between the worksheets collection object and the sheets

93
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.750
collection object.

94
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.870
So thanks,

95
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.100
guys,

96
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.150
for watching this video,

97
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.550
and I'll see on the next one
