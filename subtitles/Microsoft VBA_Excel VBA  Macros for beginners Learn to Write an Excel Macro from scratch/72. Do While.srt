1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
Okay,

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:00,710
guys.

3
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,380
So now we're gonna have a simple example for the do while loop.

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,610
So we're going to do the same,

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,060
actually,

6
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,820
as what we were doing on the example for the do until so here.

7
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,540
I've got some code and is going to select cell a one.

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,170
And then while the value of the active cell is less than 10 we're actually going to go one

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,460
step down or one cell down.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,470
So as long as the value of the active cell is less than 10 we're just going to keep on

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,790
going one step down.

12
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,710
So if I execute this code using F eight,

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,710
I'm first consider Akseli one and then I'm going to check.

14
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,360
And as long as the value of the cell is less than 10 we're going to keep on going One step

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,820
down.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,050
So now here we are on cell a 10 that contains the value of tens to here.

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:50,730
This condition is not gonna be satisfied because the value of the active cell is not less

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,320
than 10 because it's currently tends is not less than 10.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,230
So we're gonna exit the loop and execute the end soap.

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:58,870
Now,

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,150
if we switch to the do loop while structure.

22
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,550
So here,

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,750
if I execute this code,

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,070
you can see her that we actually,

25
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,600
instead of checking for the condition first and then executing the code,

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,980
we execute the code first,

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,220
and then we check for the condition.

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,480
We're going to get the same result in this case.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,900
But in some other cases,

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,250
using the do while structure is better than using the do loop.

31
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:25,700
Ah,

32
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,720
wild structure.

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,430
It old depends on your code and what you're trying to achieve.

34
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:30,880
And so,

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,060
but in a lot of cases,

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,780
using do while loop is better than using Do loop oil guy.

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,340
So this was a simple example for the do.

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,630
Well,

39
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,830
Lou,

40
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,550
thank you very much for watching this video I'll see on the next one.
