1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330
Okay,

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,600
guys.

3
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,190
So now we're gonna introduce a very important statement that you're going to use Ah lot

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,480
when handling errors,

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,760
which is the on error statement.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,340
Okay,

7
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,400
so let's say I've written this line of code here.

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,080
Worksheets,

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,590
my work,

10
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,720
she does select.

11
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,910
And actually,

12
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,570
there isn't a worksheet that is called my work shit in this workbook.

13
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,550
So if you run that,

14
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:27,650
you will get a runtime our sister out of range Soil press end year and try to deal with

15
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,150
Blair.

16
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:35,920
The simplest form of dealing with the air is to write on her resume next,

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,400
so honor resume.

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,760
Next.

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,880
What it does is that it just simply ignores the error.

20
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,050
So this statement is gonna cause an error.

21
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,720
We'll just ignore it and execute anything after it.

22
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,150
So maybe message box.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,050
We have ignored the error.

24
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,040
And if we just execute that,

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,520
let's do it step by step,

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,170
actually.

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,240
So on her resume next year.

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,580
And so now any statement there's gonna cause an error that is gonna come after on air a

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:05,970
resume.

30
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,510
Next,

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,070
the error is just gonna be ignored,

32
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,530
OK?

33
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,840
And please note that is gonna be for any statement that would cause an error.

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,620
Not just this statement here.

35
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,570
Worksheets might work.

36
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,050
She does select any statement that would cause air.

37
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,780
From now on,

38
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,960
after executing the honor resume,

39
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,270
next line of code is gonna be ignored.

40
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,560
So now works.

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,220
It's my work.

42
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,870
She select this schools in Arab,

43
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,860
but it actually is gonna be ignored.

44
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,000
And then we'll execute this message box,

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and that's it.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,550
OK,

47
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,230
so here the macro ends.

48
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,810
And so if we write actually another statement that would cause an error.

49
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,110
So my worksheets Another where?

50
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,510
Sheet.

51
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,340
I'm just gonna call it another worksheet.

52
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,600
Select.

53
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,860
So this one as well should cause an error.

54
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,100
But because it's part of our mockery execute this statement here on our resume Next,

55
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,840
this is going to affect this statement there is gonna be ignored.

56
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,850
And this statement is,

57
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,050
Well,

58
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,370
area is gonna be ignored and then going to get our message box.

59
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:03,840
Well,

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,800
that's a very easy way to who ignore errors.

61
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,440
But you're just ignoring them.

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,630
You're not handling them.

63
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,240
You're not creating a work around or a solution for the air.

64
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,540
Okay,

65
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,860
but this is the simplest form.

66
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,410
Sometimes you're going to use it is the simplest thing that you can do.

67
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,370
There are more sophisticated or more complex stuff that you can do on handling errors
