1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,270
Okay,

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,630
So one of the first things that you'd want to do before taking this course is to activate

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,260
the developer tab on the ribbon.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,360
You can activate the developer tab on the ribbon by just right clicking anywhere on the

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,170
ribbon and then clicking on customize the ribbon on.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,570
Then you're going to choose customize ribbon here.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,080
And then here you have the developer top here.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,580
You can just check the check box here for developer and click.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,040
OK,

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,330
and you will have the developer top activated.
