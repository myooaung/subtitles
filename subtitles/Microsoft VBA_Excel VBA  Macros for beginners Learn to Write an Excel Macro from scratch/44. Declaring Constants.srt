00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
in this video,

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,370
we're going to speak about Constance and Constance.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,890
Air basically values or tax that their value does not change.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,450
Like,

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,270
for example,

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,450
the pie value.

7
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,010
The pie value is a long decimal,

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,010
but it starts with 3.14 and then a lot of other digits.

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,890
And for the sake of simplicity,

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,770
we're just gonna approximate it to 3.14.

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,650
So this value is a constant.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,850
So you can actually declare a constant to be either public so that it can be used from any

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,790
procedure in any module in your workbook or it can be declared as a private.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,470
And in that case,

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,480
it can be only used in the module that it's been declared in.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,500
So to declare a constant,

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,150
all you need to do is to write public,

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,170
to say we're gonna declare a public constant.

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,870
So you're going to write public,

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,650
Const.

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,450
Let's say we're gonna call it pie value as single.

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,250
For example,

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,480
this ever gonna declare its status up to be a single equal to 3.14.

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,140
Okay,

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,490
so we're declaring a constant is gonna be public's.

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,580
It can be used in any sir procedure and in any module in a workbook,

27
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,130
and its data type is gonna be a single,

28
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,850
and its value is gonna be 3.14.

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:37,480
So this is how you can declare a constant so the value of this constant can be used in any

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,950
macro in our workbook.

31
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,090
So in this case,

32
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,030
if you run this macro,

33
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,820
for example,

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,150
here,

35
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:49,560
we're going to get the area of the circle and it's gonna assume the value of the pie to be

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,640
3.14.

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,860
So if I run through this macro,

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,150
actually step by step,

39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,840
you can see here the pie value is 3.14.

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:06,600
It got its value from this public constant and were able to get the value off our area.

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,840
We could do that as well.

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,150
For the second circle,

43
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,290
you can see here that actually the pie values recognised a 3.14.

44
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,550
Even before calculating the area,

45
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,900
it's recognizing the constant that we have declared.

46
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,810
Okay,

47
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,190
so this is how you can declare a constant.

48
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,070
And this can work,

49
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,480
of course,

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,310
in any module.

51
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,850
Sufi,

52
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,880
if you have actually another procedure in module to here,

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,370
have got another PSA procedure.

54
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,020
School circle three.

55
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,780
You can calculate the area of that circle is going to recognize that this pie value is

56
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,380
equal to 3.14.

57
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,450
Also,

58
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,550
you could make the constant private,

59
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,720
and in that case,

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,480
axity the value for it would be only recognized in module one.

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,120
So if you run these macros and module one,

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,330
you're gonna be able to get the area of the circle.

63
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,050
Normally,

64
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,060
however,

65
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,740
if you go to module to and since the constant has been declared to be private to only

66
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,140
module one if you run actually,

67
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,960
the macro in module tool if you step through that step by step using F eight on your

68
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,400
keyboard is here.

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,670
Actually,

70
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,030
the pie values empties,

71
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,970
not recognizing the constant pi value because it's been declared as a private okay.

72
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,660
And we get the areas zero because it's empty is actually a zero.

73
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,580
You're multiplying something.

74
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,050
My zero,

75
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,950
you get a zero.

76
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,520
Okay,

77
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:33,550
so this is how you can declare either a public or private constant.

78
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:39,350
You can also declare a constant to be specific to just a certain serve procedure boy

79
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,500
declaring its value inside the sub procedure,

80
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,740
berating Const.

81
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,800
And then the name of the constant as whatever data type you wanted the clarity as to be

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,240
equal to its value.

83
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,830
Okay,

84
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,810
so you can actually do that as well.

85
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,170
You can make the value of the constant Onley specific to a particular sub procedure.

86
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,810
This is what we've done here in these two sub procedures.
