00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,470
in this video,

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,820
we're going to talk about the value and text properties for the range object,

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,940
and we'll see how the differ from each other case.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,310
I'm gonna go to my vb a editor here.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,050
I'm gonna insert in you module.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,310
I'm gonna make a new micro's sub Molly value,

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,500
for example.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,810
Okay,

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:35,260
so if I say range a $1 value by type that and then I put it equal to 12 and I run that it's

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,470
gonna put a one equals to 12 okay?

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,590
And actually,

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,930
the dot value property is the default property for the range objects.

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,790
As you've seen on the previous video on a previous video,

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:56,500
we ignored the dot value property and we just set a one equals to 12 and it would still put

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,600
a one equals to 12 or equals to the value that you've put after the equal sign.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,280
Because the DOD value is the default property.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,420
So if you omit the property the dot value property,

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,550
Excel will assume that you mean the dot value property when you write that statement.

19
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,250
Okay,

20
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,870
Now let's do something else,

21
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,330
which is just going to give this 12 a bit of formatting Okay,

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,160
so I'm going to make it $12 so the value is actually 12.

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:40,240
But how it looks is that it's $12 So this is how it appears to me.

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,970
But the actual value is 12.

25
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,690
And I'm just gonna verify that by writing a message box function,

26
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,420
and I'm gonna ask it to give me range a $1 value,

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,110
and we'll talk about the message box function later on.

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,680
But just for now,

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,470
you got to know that all it does is that it displays a message box and it gives you what's

30
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,690
inside the message box function.

31
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:11,370
So I'm going to run that and you'll see that a message box has popped up and it's got the

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,060
value for range a one.

33
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,910
So because of us,

34
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,350
for the value it gave me 12 because this is the value that's in cell a one.

35
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,660
However,

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,370
if I ask for the text So there's another property for the range object,

37
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,880
which is called the Tax.

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,580
It's gonna give you the actual text that's appearing to you.

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:43,260
So if I run that you can see here that has given me $12 because this is the text that's

40
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,300
appearing in the cell.

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,090
Okay,

42
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,980
so now we've seen how the value and the text properties differ from each other.

43
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,850
The value property gives you the value off the sell off.

44
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,040
What's inside the cell on Dad?

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,700
Actually,

46
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,950
the text property gives you the text that's appearing to you in the cell.

47
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,010
So that means that if you've got some formatting applied to the values off the cell,

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,500
it will actually give you the text,

49
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,950
which includes value and the formatting,

50
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,610
Basically.

51
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,600
And actually what you get as an output from the text property is basically a string.

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,370
So a text basically okay.

53
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,110
And we'll talk about strings and the data types of different data types in vb A later on.

54
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,890
So thank you guys for watching this video and please follow me on to the next.
