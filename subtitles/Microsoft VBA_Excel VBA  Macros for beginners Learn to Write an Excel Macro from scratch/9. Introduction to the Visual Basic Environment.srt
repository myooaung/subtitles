00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170
Hey,

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,450
guys,

3
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,020
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,910
So in this video,

5
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,060
we're going to have an introduction for the visual basic environment.

6
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,880
So the visual basic environment is where all the coding work is done.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,580
This is where we write our code and do a lot of stuff on.

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,420
We will spend a lot of time during this course in our visual basic environment.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,130
So to get to the visual basic environment,

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,670
you can either hit old and F 11 on your keyboard,

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,070
where you can go to the developer tab and click on Visual.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,190
Basic on.

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,610
This is the visual basic environment.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,070
And,

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,870
as you can see here at the top,

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,300
we've got a title bar which says Microsoft Visual Basic for applications.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,120
And then it has the name of the workbook VB editor intro.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,650
So just like any Windows application,

19
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,460
you'll have a title bar having the title off the application that you've got open.

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,730
And as you can see here,

21
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,660
we've got some menus as well,

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,090
and these menus are the typical menus that we find on almost any Windows application,

23
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,040
and we will deal with them as we progress through the course.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,600
Also,

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,540
we will find here a toolbar with some buttons.

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,890
So we've got here this button that would put us back to the Microsoft Excel environment and

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,610
also this save button here that can save our work in the visual basic environments to save

28
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,150
old the code that we've written.

29
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,830
We've got this play button here that runs our code and some other buttons as well,

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,590
and we will deal with them as we progress through the course.

31
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,480
We've also got our code window here where we write our code and we've got our Project

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,120
Explorer,

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,810
which enables you to switch between different projects.

34
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:53,800
And we've also got the properties window here that enables us to change the properties of

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,630
objects.

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,310
And we will deal with these elements and speak about them as we progress through the course

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,910
as well.

38
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,850
So,

39
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,300
guys,

40
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,100
this was a quick overview about the visual basic environment.

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,370
Thank you very much for watching this video on else.

42
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,320
You on the next one
