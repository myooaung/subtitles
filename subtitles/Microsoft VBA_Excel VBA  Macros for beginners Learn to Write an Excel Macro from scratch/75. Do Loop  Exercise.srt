1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430
Okay,

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:00,690
guys.

3
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,450
So now we're gonna have an exercise for the do loop.

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,650
So we're actually going to do the same exercise that we did on the for each loop.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,860
But we're going to do it.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,170
This thing using a do loop toe haidl the sheets in this workbook except for the exercise

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:17,560
sheet.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,890
And of course,

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,910
you know your hint that you're going to use a property for sheets,

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,550
which is the doubt visible.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,050
Here's the link for the property.

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,090
If you want to read about it on MST on,

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,650
so please attempt the exercise.

14
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,240
And if you get stuck,

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,250
I've actually got the answer here on this module called Exercise Answer.

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,410
You can have a look at the answer if you get stuck,

17
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,230
but please attempt the exercise first.

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,580
And if you have any questions,

19
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,650
please leave them in the Q and a section.

20
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,400
Thank you very much for watching this video,

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,730
and I'll see you on the next one
