1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190
Hey,

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,480
guys,

3
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,150
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,260
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,000
we're going to see the exit do statement.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,730
And also we're going to see a do loop where actually we would create a counter to count how

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,350
many passes or how many interational we've done in the loop.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:16,990
So here,

9
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,550
we're gonna have actually the same example that we had previously on the exit for statement

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,210
where we hade a random number generated,

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,610
and we wanted it to be equal to the value of the active cell.

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,970
And this Rendon This factor is a scenario that you might face where you don't know on which

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,020
iteration or in which passed.

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,140
You're gonna need to exit the loop.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,950
So here I've got some variables.

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,980
The last row where we actually get the last row here on column X,

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,350
I is basically our counter and also the random number.

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,200
So we will actually activate the worksheet that's called Introduction that has our example

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,590
here.

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,280
And then we're going to get the last row on column X,

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,090
and then we're gonna actually select the first cell in column acts,

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,240
and then we're going to set the initial value for our counter to be zero.

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,740
Okay,

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,550
and then we're going to start our do loop.

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,380
We're gonna create a random number on each pass on the loop.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,480
And also,

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:23,810
we're gonna increment our counter by one so as to have this counter count how many passes

28
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,190
or how many alterations were done in the loop.

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,940
So we'll create a random number and we will test if the value of the active cell is equal

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,560
to the random number.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,110
And here we are on the first cell in column X currently.

32
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,540
And then if the random number is equal to value the active cell,

33
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,570
then we're going to get a message box that we've reached our goal after whatever number of

34
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,110
it rations and we will exit the do loop.

35
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,650
And also,

36
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,170
if that's not the case,

37
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,080
then we will test if we are on the last row.

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,090
If eyes equal to the last row.

39
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,290
So the number of iterations that we've done is equal to the last road.

40
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,020
And if that's the case,

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,010
if the number of it orations is equal to the last row,

42
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,150
then that means that we have done all our 30th durations and still we haven't reached our

43
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,650
goal.

44
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,140
So will display a message,

45
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,750
Boxes says.

46
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,550
We haven't reached our goal and exit the do loop.

47
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,320
However,

48
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,710
if we still have it orations to do so,

49
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,500
the number of it orations is not equal to the last row.

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,080
We will actually execute this statement,

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,890
which is to go to the next cell and then weaken,

52
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,430
Do another iteration and then we can increment our counter by one and start doing another

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,160
iteration and so on and so forth until we reach all 30th orations.

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,950
So let's go through that macro step by step here.

55
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,440
So,

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,250
first of all,

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,860
I'm going to select the worksheet called Introduction Here is to make sure I select the

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,750
correct worksheet.

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,100
I'm going to get the last row on column acts,

60
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,220
which is 30.

61
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:04,550
I'm also gonna select the first cell here in column X and then I'm gonna set the initial

62
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,500
value for my counter to be zero.

63
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,420
I'm going to start my do loop.

64
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,270
So now the value of all he is equal to zero.

65
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,170
Now we're going to give it a value of one source to incremental it by one,

66
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,350
and to indicate now that we are in the first pass on the loop we're going to generate a

67
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,840
random number and we're gonna ask the question,

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,170
is the value of the actor so equal to the random number?

69
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,730
The random members currently 22 the value the active cell is currently one.

70
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,750
So there no equal.

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,310
So we're gonna do the loop again and keep on doing it until the value of the actor cell is

72
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,550
equal to the random number.

73
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,400
So if I keep on executing this macro,

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,920
if I continue press here the play button and this year we haven't reached our goal.

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,120
So we've done 30 passes through Lupin,

76
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
generated 30 numbers,

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,970
and they've never been equal to the value of the active cell.

78
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,130
We could run it again and we still haven't reached our goal.

79
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,870
And we can try again and we still haven't reached.

80
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,580
Our goal is really a random thing.

81
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,380
So and here we've reached our go after 11 integrations.

82
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,050
So you can see here that we managed to reach our goal on one pass here and exit the loop

83
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,560
before we've gone through all the it orations.

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,120
OK,

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,810
so the exit do statement does the same thing as the exit for statement,

86
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,070
except that we use it with the do loop.

87
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,370
And we've seen here a technique as well on how to count the number of iterations that

88
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,180
you've done in a do loop.

89
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,840
So maybe you would want account that for whatever reason,

90
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,490
maybe you're testing your macro and you want to include that technique in order to know

91
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,990
when you reach your goal.

92
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,420
After how many alterations,

93
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,520
Maybe you'd want to run it several times and know on average,

94
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,560
after how many alterations you reach your goal.

95
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,840
So that's it for this example where we learned the exit do statement,

96
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,050
and we've learned as well how to count the number of inspirations that we've done in a

97
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,470
doodle.

98
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,700
Thank you very much for watching this video and L c on the next one.
