1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
Alright,

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,750
guys,

3
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,560
let's have some examples for the different types of errors that we might encounter in xlv B

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:07,880
A.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:15,420
So if you write workbooks my workbook and then I miss the second double quote here and a

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,710
close of rockets dot open You can see air We got a compiler,

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,130
but before we even got them SMIs itch box for the compile Ari kas here the R code turned

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,690
red.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,530
So this is a syntax error.

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,880
Your co turning grad means you have a syntax error.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
You have a grammar or spelling mistake.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,710
So our grammar spending mistake here is that we didn't put the second double quote.

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,100
So this is a Syntex er now to have an example for a compiler.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,890
Let's say we put instead of workbooks,

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,380
we put just the word workbook here.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:56,550
Now this is still not generated this Syntex air because the word workbook is a word that is

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,450
part of the XlV be a dictionary.

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:06,070
So VB a recognizes this word as part of its dictionary and so he will not tell you there's

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,130
a spelling mistake.

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,100
However,

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,290
when it tries to run the code,

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,350
it will generate to compel er because although the word workbook exists in the V B A

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,220
dictionary.

24
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,370
It is not put in the right context.

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,350
It's it does not make sense to put it in this context.

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,540
So if you run the code here,

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,030
you'll get a compiler because the word workbook cannot be used in this context.

28
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,350
So you need to use workbooks,

29
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,280
not workbook.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,590
So this is a compiler now to have an example for a run time error.

31
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,310
If we write worksheets,

32
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,850
my worksheet dot select.

33
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,210
As you can see here,

34
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,950
our code has not turned red.

35
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,910
So that means that there isn't a syntax error.

36
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,330
And also we can check for compel ER,

37
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,000
and we can do that even before running our code by going to the debug menu here and

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,070
clicking on Compile VB a project.

39
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,370
So if you click on that and we don't get an error,

40
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,100
that means that there aren't any compel Er's on our code.

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,410
And if we run this code,

42
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:07,700
though,

43
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,930
we will get in error.

44
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,760
And the reason for that is that although this action is a valid action to select a

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,290
worksheet called my Worksheet,

46
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,270
we will not be able to do it because we do not have a worksheet that is called my worksheet

47
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,960
in this current workbook.

48
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,950
So if you run that,

49
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,250
you're getting harassed out of range,

50
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,310
and that is because we do not have a worksheet in this work work that is called my

51
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,110
worksheet that we can select.

52
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,660
So this is a valid action.

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,440
However,

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,320
we cannot do it because there isn't a worksheet that's called my worksheet that exists now

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,320
.

56
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,520
The errors that you're gonna be dealing with the most or that you're gonna be encountering

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,120
the most are actually one time errors because syntax errors are gonna be pretty obvious

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,460
when you write your code,

59
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,370
you will have it highlighted in red indicating the part of your code is having a problem.

60
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,390
And most of the time you'll be able to figure out what the problem is on.

61
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,920
Compel ours as well are going to get you an error and that part of the code and actually

62
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,570
your cold will not start running in the first place.

63
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,240
So be able to discovery pretty early over run time.

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,060
Errors can happen,

65
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,460
actually,

66
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,640
after the code runs for some time.

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,330
And even after you try the code several times where on some trials.

68
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,590
Your code runs fine.

69
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,690
And on others,

70
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,580
your code would generate an error.

71
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,270
So this is actually the error type that you're gonna be spending most of your towing

72
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,320
focusing on and handling,

73
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,190
which is the run time errors.

74
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,820
So,

75
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,870
on the upcoming videos,

76
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,440
we're going to be focusing on how to handle one time errors.

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,140
We're going to see different methods and techniques to do that.

78
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,570
So thank you for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
