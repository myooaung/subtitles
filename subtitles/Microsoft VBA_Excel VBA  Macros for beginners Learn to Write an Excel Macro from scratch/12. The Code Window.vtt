00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.280
Okay,

2
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.520
guys.

3
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.420
So now we're going to speak about the code window and the code window,

4
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.250
or the modules are basically containers for your Mac Rose.

5
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.870
And this is where you're going to write.

6
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.510
Coat.

7
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.890
This is where you're going to write VB a code.

8
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.920
And this is where most of the action action he is gonna happen.

9
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.160
Now you can see here that I've got a module here that is created.

10
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.830
They schooled module one,

11
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.050
and module one has been created because I recorded some macros here on this workbook.

12
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.880
The absolute macaron,

13
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.020
The relative macro.

14
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.050
But actually,

15
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.170
even if you don't record Mac Rose on your workbook,

16
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.920
a module is already created in Excel,

17
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.630
which is,

18
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.530
for example,

19
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.950
the sheet module here.

20
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.970
This is a module that is already created an excel,

21
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.600
and you can start using it so I can write a PSA procedure called testing code,

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.310
for example.

23
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.020
And then Aiken destroyed any coat range D one equals one,

24
00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.980
for example,

25
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.710
and this is going to put the value of one in cell D one.

26
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.100
So if you run that,

27
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.850
it would still work,

28
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.810
Okay.

29
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.160
However,

30
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.890
normally you do not use the worksheet module or the workbook module to write Normal Micro's

31
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.890
,

32
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.120
you'd normally use them to write event procedures.

33
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.630
OK,

34
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.500
so I'm just gonna delete that because normally you would write normal Macron's in modules.

35
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.570
You create a module either you created or excel it created,

36
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.790
and then you would write the macro that way.

37
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.240
Okay,

38
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.800
so let's go back to our code window here,

39
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.920
and as you can see here at the top,

40
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.090
we've got two menus here to drop down menus.

41
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.430
We've got the object or up,

42
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.810
down,

43
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.590
and we've got the procedure top down on the object.

44
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.130
Drop down allows you to select different objects,

45
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.520
okay.

46
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.360
And we will see that in the future,

47
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.350
especially when we deal with events.

48
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.750
And this procedure drop down allows you to use a certain procedure for that particular

49
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.310
object.

50
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.500
So,

51
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.080
for example,

52
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.390
if you select a worksheet,

53
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.520
you could use the procedure for activating the worksheet.

54
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.140
For example,

55
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.340
which is gonna be the event,

56
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.340
whatever code you're gonna fire whenever that particular sheet is activated and we will see

57
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.540
that in the future.

58
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.800
Now,

59
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.520
currently,

60
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.400
the object drop down has only general in it because we're in a normal module.

61
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.680
But when we're working in events we're going to see workbook or worksheet,

62
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.970
and in this procedure dropped on,

63
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.510
you're going to see your micro's your different macros.

64
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.430
Okay,

65
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.070
so I've got here the absolute macron,

66
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.190
the relative macro.

67
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.570
Okay,

68
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.820
so right now in this module,

69
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.550
we've got two procedures.

70
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.500
We've got the absolute macro procedure,

71
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.890
and we've got the relative macro procedure.

72
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.330
And as you can see here,

73
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.550
I can see both procedures in the module.

74
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.680
If we look at the bottom here,

75
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.030
we will see that we've got two buttons.

76
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.840
We get the full module view button and the procedure view button.

77
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.220
And these buttons enable us to either have a view viewing all the procedures in the module

78
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.770
or just a single procedure.

79
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.180
So,

80
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.610
actually,

81
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.790
if we switch to the procedure of you while we are in the absolute macro,

82
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.200
if you click on that,

83
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.090
you can see here that we are now in a view that shows us just a single procedure.

84
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.030
And this is useful if you've got a lot of procedures in your module and you would like to

85
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.550
focus on just one procedure in order to avoid writing code in the incorrect procedure.

86
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.030
So if you go back to the full module view.

87
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.310
You'll actually see all the procedures in the module.

88
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.580
If we click inside the relative macro and go to the procedure view,

89
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.980
you can see where we are now focused in the relative macro procedure.

90
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.830
Okay,

91
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.440
so these two buttons enable is to toggle between either a full module view or just a

92
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.080
focused view on a single procedure.

93
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.120
Okay,

94
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.500
so now you see this bar here on the left.

95
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.850
This is called the margin Indicator bar,

96
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.140
and it's going to give us some visual cues or visual indicators when we're doing our

97
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.080
handling and debugging for our code,

98
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.260
and we'll see how to do air handing and debugging in the future.

99
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.350
So thanks for watching guys I'll see on the next video.
