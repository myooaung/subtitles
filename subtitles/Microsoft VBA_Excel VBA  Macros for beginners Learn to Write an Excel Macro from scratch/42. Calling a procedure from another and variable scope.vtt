00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.170
Hey,

2
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:00.470
guys,

3
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.130
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.100
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.000
we're going to see how we can call one procedure from another.

6
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.090
So how to run a macro from another macro?

7
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.840
And we're going to see the scope of the variables and how their value actually becomes

8
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.070
empty once you exit the procedure that they have been declared in.

9
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.570
And on the next lecture,

10
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.150
we're going to see how to declare public variables.

11
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.230
So actually have good a procedure here called calling procedure.

12
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.000
And within that Colin procedure,

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.370
we're gonna call another procedure that I've called cold procedure that is actually below

14
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.720
here.

15
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.050
So the procedure below will be called by the procedure at the top.

16
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.920
So if I go through the procedure at the top for go through the macro the top by pressing F

17
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470
eight on my keyboard,

18
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.990
So I'm going to step into the macro going into it,

19
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.890
step by step.

20
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.150
And as you can see her,

21
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.740
I'm now on the line that says cold,

22
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.570
cold procedures.

23
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.760
Some.

24
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.940
When I execute that line,

25
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.630
we're going to go to a court procedure.

26
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.360
So this is actually how you can call a procedure from another procedure just right.

27
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.800
Cool.

28
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.850
And the name of the procedure that you want to call.

29
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.690
And as I'm stepping through,

30
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.710
I'm actually here on the step that will set the value of a variable Cold War two in the

31
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.380
court procedure to 125.1.

32
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.450
I'm actually going to set up a watch window here,

33
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.920
so I'm going to right click,

34
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.620
click on add watch,

35
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.150
and then I'm gonna create a watch window for VAR to on a watch window.

36
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.170
Basically enables you to keep an eye on the value of your variable.

37
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.020
As you're stepping through your procedure and the complex Alva is gonna be in cold

38
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.410
procedure because this variable is limited,

39
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.970
the scope of it is limited to only this procedure.

40
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.930
So I'm gonna press OK here and now when I execute this step,

41
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.580
you'll see her.

42
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.450
This value is currently 125.1,

43
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.680
so this watch window here enables me to keep an eye on the value off my variable as I'm

44
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.660
stepping through the procedure Now,

45
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.440
when I execute this step,

46
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.920
they schooled end sub.

47
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.460
You can see here that the value is now out of context and actually my variable has become

48
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.810
empty.

49
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.720
So if I right in my immediate window here a question mark and then var to tow us for the

50
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.070
value of our two.

51
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:20.100
I'm not going to get a values get a nem t value because the value of the variable has been

52
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.410
cleared once the procedure has won,

53
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.210
it scores.

54
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.440
So,

55
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.970
as you can see here on the court procedure after finish it,

56
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.560
the value of this variable var to is going to be cleared from system memory and snowing and

57
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.430
contain any value.

58
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.780
So this is something that you need to bury.

59
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.790
Mind that when you declare a variable inside a procedure,

60
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.190
once your procedure finishes running,

61
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.960
the value of the variable is going to be cleared from system.

62
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.570
Memory is not gonna have any value.

63
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.390
And if I just execute the end sub here just to finish everything,

64
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.410
so that's it.

65
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.080
So you need to bear that in mind When you declare variable inside and micro and the macro

66
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.690
has run its course,

67
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.340
the value of the variable is gonna be cleared from system memory.

68
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.960
So how do we create some sort of a public variable on something that can retain its value

69
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.760
throughout the module or it throughout the workbook.

70
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.290
We're going to see that on the next video.

71
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.770
So thanks,

72
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.550
guys watching I'll see on the next one.
