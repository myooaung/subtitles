00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150
Hey,

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,440
guys.

3
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,700
Welcome box In this video,

4
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,000
we're going to discuss the workbook.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,030
New sheet events of the workbook.

6
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,960
New sheet event runs whatever code you put in it,

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,620
whenever you insert in you sheet so you can get it.

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,090
Of course,

9
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,750
by opening your VB editor,

10
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,070
double clicking on this workbook and from this man,

11
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,420
you're gonna select workbook.

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,530
And from this men,

13
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,310
you're gonna select new sheet.

14
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,010
So whatever he could you put in,

15
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,840
it will be run whenever you insert in.

16
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,860
You she So,

17
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,470
for example,

18
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,760
I could put a message box you have inserted in you sheet.

19
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,210
Okay,

20
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,830
so now whenever we insert in you sheet,

21
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,700
let's just inserting you sheet here because he here that the message box pops up,

22
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,500
you have inserted a new sheet,

23
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,230
and actually this code runs after the sheet is inserted.

24
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,190
So actually the sheet is inserted first,

25
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,470
and then the code runs.

26
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,810
Something else that we need to learn about is actually the S h parameter.

27
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,330
Okay.

28
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,820
And this H perimeter is basically a worksheet object,

29
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,690
and it refers to the worksheet this just been inserted.

30
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,550
Okay,

31
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:16,570
So something else that you can do is that you could give each new sheet inserted a number.

32
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,210
Okay.

33
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,370
So,

34
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,030
for example,

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,980
if we insert a new sheet in our case here because it's gonna be the fifth sheet in the

36
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,490
workbook,

37
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,390
it's gonna be assigned the number five.

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,590
So you can do this.

39
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,200
You could write.

40
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,880
Shh.

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,490
Stop Name equals this work.

42
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,170
Booked out worksheets dot count.

43
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:32,640
Okay,

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,570
so now is going to be given the number five,

45
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,150
or actually,

46
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,440
each sheet is inserted.

47
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,250
Is gonna be having a number that is gonna be equal to the number of worksheets that would

48
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,550
be available after inserting the new worksheet.

49
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:45,720
So,

50
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,340
for example,

51
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,400
us instead of a new sheet here in Syria,

52
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,670
has been given the number five.

53
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,390
That's instead of another one has been given a number six because it's the sixth.

54
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,370
And unless you insert 1/3 1 has been given the number seven because it's seven.

55
00:01:59,370 --> 00:01:59,850
Okay,

56
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,110
so this is the workbook new sheet event.

57
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,320
I typically don't use that a lot,

58
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,380
But if there is something in your business or something in in your applications that you

59
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,220
would require it for its there,

60
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,350
you know how to use it.

61
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:16,890
Okay.

62
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,740
And if you find something that this event would be really useful for and you liked it.

63
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,940
Please let me know about it.

64
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,800
Let me know about what application you used it for.

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,330
I would be interested.

66
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,910
So that's it for the workbook.

67
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,730
You sheet.

68
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,200
Evan,

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,970
thank you very much.

70
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,910
Watching this video I'll see on the next.
