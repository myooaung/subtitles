00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
in this video,

2
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.690
we're going to discuss the range dot count property.

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.210
So the range thought count property.

4
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.650
What it does is that it gives us the count off the cells in a range,

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.850
and it will count the cells regardless if they contain values or not.

6
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.040
So even if the cells are blank,

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.310
they will still be counted.

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.970
And that is unlike the count function in Excel,

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.740
the worksheet function count,

10
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.430
which you get by writing,

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.220
equals count in a cell.

12
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.130
This function will only count the cells if they contain values or numbers.

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.750
Okay,

14
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.480
so if they are blank,

15
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.070
they will not be counted in the content text.

16
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.360
They will not be counted.

17
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.650
If they contain errors,

18
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.710
they will also not be counted.

19
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.730
Okay,

20
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.900
So,

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.490
to have an example,

22
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.020
we can actually write range.

23
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.550
And then we're going to count the cells in the range that is called my table.

24
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.330
The named range that we have created before.

25
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.600
So it right range my table dark account,

26
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.650
and we'll put that inside a message box.

27
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.340
So if we run that you will actually give us the number of cells in that range.

28
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.100
Remember,

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.430
guys,

30
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.070
the my table range was between a 12 f done.

31
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.710
So if we run that he will give us the count of the cells in that range.

32
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.680
So how many cells are in that range?

33
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.560
We've got 60 cells because that ranges six columns by 10 rows.

34
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.450
Okay,

35
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.310
So as you can see as well,

36
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.610
the cells have been counted regardless.

37
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.100
If the contained values or not,

38
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.510
you see the cells or blank.

39
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.140
But they have still being counted.

40
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.240
But in case of the count function,

41
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.170
the con function will not count blank cells.

42
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.770
Okay,

43
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.060
so I will also show you how to use the count function through VB.

44
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.630
A year will probably should have a separate video on how to use worksheet functions in XlV

45
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.630
.

46
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.250
Be able just show you how to use the count function here.

47
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.690
So actually put some values in my range first range money table.

48
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.320
So put 10 here,

49
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.870
for example,

50
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.890
any value press control and enter to just fill the whole range with this value.

51
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.600
Now,

52
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.350
I can actually count the number of cells in that range using the count function.

53
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.500
So I drive application worksheet function dot count and then I'll put my range,

54
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.610
which is range my underscore table,

55
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.470
OK?

56
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.660
And I'll put the inside a message box.

57
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.570
So if we run that you will see here that we will get 60 because all the cells contain

58
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.220
values.

59
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.950
Remember that count function does not count empty cells.

60
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.740
But if we clear some of the cells here,

61
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.970
make them empty and we run that again.

62
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.260
So I've actually clear 10 cells so that she give me 50.

63
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.870
So as you can see here,

64
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.070
we've got the count function giving us 50 cells as the count off the cells because it does

65
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.290
not count blank cells.

66
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.090
Okay,

67
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.770
so we will have actually another video in the course about how to use worksheet functions

68
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.760
in xlv b A,

69
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.010
but just wanted to show you the difference between the range not count property and the

70
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.110
worksheet function that is gold count.

71
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.700
OK,

72
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.770
so thanks,

73
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.000
guys.

74
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.850
Watching this video,

75
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.050
I'll see you on the next one
