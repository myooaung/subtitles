1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
and this video,

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,650
we're going to discuss the immediate window and the locals window and the watch window,

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,480
which are tools to help us troubleshoot,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,410
are coat and do air handling and debugging.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:11,860
So,

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,330
first of all,

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,080
the immediate window,

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,020
you can view it by going to the view menu here and then clicking on the immediate window or

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,310
you compress control and G on your keyboard,

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,560
and the immediate window allows you to run code on the fly.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,980
You can just type question mark and then,

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,850
for example,

13
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,470
I'm going to run a message box here.

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,730
I would say I'm just trying the immediate window,

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,900
and I'm just gonna close my brackets and press enter and then you can see here.

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm going to get a message box pop up that says,

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,800
I'm just trying the immediate window.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,570
And don't worry about the message box.

19
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,320
If you don't know what the message box is,

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,580
we're gonna explaining in detail in the future.

21
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,420
But I'm just demonstrating the ability of the immediate window to let you or to allow you

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,880
to run code on the fly.

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,620
The second window is the locals window,

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,370
so you can view the locals window by going to the view menu here at the top and then

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:13,130
clicking on locals window So the locals window allows you to see the names of your

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,200
valuables and the values and their types when you're running your macro step by step,

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,980
for example.

28
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,080
So this is useful in trouble shooting and debugging your macro,

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,010
and we will see that in the future when we go into the air handling section.

30
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,860
So this is a very useful window for troubleshooting and air handling.

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,740
The third window is the watch window,

32
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,910
and you can view the watch window by going to the view menu here and then clicking on watch

33
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,380
window.

34
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,190
So the watch window allows you to monitor expressions or variables,

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,970
and an expression is basically it can be like a formula containing multiple valuable,

36
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,410
so it allows you to monitor expressions not only variables,

37
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,820
and you can see their value on their type and their contacts as well.

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,190
And you speak about that later,

39
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:08,900
and it also allows you to stop running gear macro when your expression reaches a certain

40
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,290
value.

41
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,270
So when it reaches the value of true or when it reaches one or zero,

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,950
so you can determined that and said that up on the watch window.

43
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,450
OK,

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,780
so this is also very useful in troubleshooting and debugging your coat.

45
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,160
OK,

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,390
guys.

47
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,450
So that's it for the immediate and locals and the watch windows.

48
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,820
Thank you so much watching,

49
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,810
I'll see on the next one.
