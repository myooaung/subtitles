Hey,

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,000
guys,

3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,630
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,880
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,920
I just wanted to go over the comparison Operators in XlV be a really quickly because these

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,220
comparison operators air going to be used in comparing expressions to each other.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:19,010
So there's this is something is equal to something or less than or greater than or not

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,870
equal to.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,800
You.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,690
Probably used the's comparison operators when you were using the Normal Excel grid,

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,440
but I just wanted to go over them really quickly.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,690
So get the equal sign you got not equal to get the less than so in greater than son.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,500
This is less than or equal to and the greater than or equal to.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,870
So I believe you should be familiar with them already.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,980
But I just wanted to get them out of the way because we're going to use them.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,630
Ah,

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,550
lot in this course,

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:55,660
and I'll be also including a PdF document listing these comparison operators.

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,650
So thank you very much watching this video guys I don't see on the next one
