1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330
Okay,

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,580
guys.

3
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,450
So in this video,

4
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,540
we're going to discuss another feature in error handling,

5
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,130
which is how to set up a break point on your code.

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,120
So a break point enables your code to stop executing at a certain point that you will

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,010
specify.

8
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:21,630
And this is gonna be especially useful in events because you cannot execute events step by

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,010
step.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,250
By pressing F eight on your keyboard,

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,270
you will need to set up a break point to stop the coat from executing and be able to

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,110
troubleshoot it.

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,490
So to set up a break point for your code,

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,290
you can just click inside the line that you want your coat to stop executing at.

15
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,930
And then in this gray bar here,

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,830
beside it on the left,

17
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,710
you can just click this way.

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,090
You've tuggle the break point,

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,280
and if you run your code,

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,250
it will stop.

21
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,470
At this point,

22
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,420
it will not go beyond it.

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,000
So if I just stop executing my code here if I want toe untouchable,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,300
this break points Ooh,

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,960
remove the break point.

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,370
I can just click on this red circle here,

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,890
and it's gonna be removed.

28
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:11,020
Another way to tuggle a break point as well is to go to the debug menu here and click on

29
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,110
Double Break Point.

30
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,530
Or you can also press F knowing on your keyboard.

31
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,290
There is another way as well,

32
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,030
which is using the debug toolbar here.

33
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,380
So if you right click at the top and enable the debug to bar,

34
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,750
you can just click on this hand here,

35
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,150
which struggles a break point as well.

36
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,370
So I just wanted you to get introduced to the concept of creating a break point to stop

37
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,940
your coat from executing at a certain point,

38
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,620
because we will need that when using events,

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,040
and you can also use it in normal.

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,240
Macron's where you would want to stop your code from executing at a certain point and check

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,640
the values of some variables,

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,420
for example,

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,120
or so.

44
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,940
So that's it,

45
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,310
guys,

46
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,690
for troubling a break point.

47
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,670
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see on the next one
