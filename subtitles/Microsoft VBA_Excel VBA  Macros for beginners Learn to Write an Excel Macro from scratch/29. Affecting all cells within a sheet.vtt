Hey,

2
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.500
guys,

3
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.070
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.890
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.000
we're going to see how we can use the cells collection object to affect all the cells

6
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.630
within the sheet or within,

7
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.330
actually or current sheet.

8
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.410
So to do that,

9
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.180
you can write cells dot And then you can see here that all the methods and properties for

10
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.710
the cells collection object which are actually similar to the ones that we've explained on

11
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.620
the range object will actually start appearing.

12
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.330
Okay,

13
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.820
so we can actually write cells dot fund start name equals Ariel,

14
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.760
for example,

15
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.520
and we can write as well.

16
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.390
Sells dot Fund size equals equals 15 for example.

17
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.800
Okay,

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.920
So what this is going to do is that is going to change the font name for all the cells in

19
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.870
this sheet to be Ariel.

20
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.150
And it's gonna change the fund size as well to be 15 for all the cells in the sheet.

21
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.390
So I'm actually gonna put the value of 10 in some of the cells year just as a sample.

22
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.180
But actually the changes will not just affect these cells.

23
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.330
It will affect all the cells within the sheet.

24
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.000
But I'm just putting a sample for you.

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.210
So if you run that this,

26
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.520
let's activate the home tab on the ribbon here.

27
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.110
You can see here that the fund to skirt the calibri So if you run that you can see here

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.750
that it's now Ariel and the fun size is 15.

29
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.300
And actually,

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.530
this is going to be applicable for any sell within the sheets,

31
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.110
because year,

32
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.450
any cell within the sheet,

33
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.740
the fun size is 15.

34
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.600
And the front name is Ariel.

35
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.240
Okay,

36
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.390
so this is basically how you can affect all the cells within a certain sheet.

37
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.820
Okay.

38
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.670
Which is using the cells collection object.

39
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.100
If you use the cells collection,

40
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.160
object to strike cells dot and then start using any property or method.

41
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.530
And that's without specifying a certain cell boy in putting a row index and a column index

42
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.530
,

43
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.030
this is actually gonna affect all the cells within your sheet.

44
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.580
Okay,

45
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.520
so thanks.

46
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.890
Guys were watching this video,

47
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.570
and I'll see on the next one
