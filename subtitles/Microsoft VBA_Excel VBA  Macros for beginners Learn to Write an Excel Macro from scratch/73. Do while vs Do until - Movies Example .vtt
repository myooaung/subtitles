Hey,

2
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.500
guys,

3
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.060
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.100
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.670
we're going to high the more complex example using to do loop.

6
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.720
And we're going to solve this problem here using it due until and it do while as well.

7
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.090
So as you can see here,

8
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.300
I've got a list of the highest grossing movies,

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.860
the movies with the heist earnings in 2016 and basically what I want to do using a Do Loop

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.070
is to either write the word millionaire or billionaire in column de,

11
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.680
depending on the movies,

12
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.350
earnings.

13
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.370
So if the movie's earnings are greater than or equal to one billion adroit the word

14
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.110
billionaire and they're less than one billion than on the word millionaire.

15
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.350
And I want to do that using a do loop.

16
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.250
So basically,

17
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.470
here on this macro,

18
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.030
the first step is that I'm gonna activate the movie sheet to make sure I work on the

19
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.870
correct sheet,

20
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.660
and then I'm going to select Cell D two and then I'm gonna do until the value of the active

21
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.670
cell toe offset zero.

22
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.280
Common negative one is equal to blank,

23
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.670
and that is the value of the cell.

24
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.600
The is on the left hand side of column D.

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.190
So basically the value of the selling column c on the same row here.

26
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.810
So I'm gonna loop until there is nothing in the cells.

27
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.350
So basically,

28
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.970
I'm going to keep on looping as long as I've got some earnings in column C And when I don't

29
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.990
have any earnings when a cell is blank,

30
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.710
then I'm going to stop the loop.

31
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.950
OK,

32
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.660
so this is the condition for stopping the loop on.

33
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.170
Basically,

34
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.010
there's an if statement here that says,

35
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.060
If the value of the sign column C just one cell to the left of the cell in column Dida I'm

36
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.660
sitting on is greater than or equal to one billion.

37
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.450
Then I'm going to set the cell in column D to be equal to billionaire Els.

38
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.890
I'm gonna put the word millionaire and then inside the lupas Well,

39
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.690
I'm gonna move one cell down to do the test again.

40
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.820
So I'm gonna move one cell down and then loop again and start doing the test again and put

41
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.930
either billionaire Oh,

42
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.770
millionaire,

43
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.260
Move on,

44
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.080
cell down.

45
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.520
Do the test again until the value off the Sun column C is equal to a blank.

46
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.120
That's when the loop stops.

47
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.950
So I'm gonna go through the loop step by step here.

48
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.170
So as you can see here,

49
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.630
I've selected cell D two.

50
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.240
I'm gonna do my testing.

51
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.210
I put billionaire on there and I'm gonna loop again.

52
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.650
Here,

53
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.490
do it again until I basically finish the loop.

54
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.960
OK,

55
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.670
so So the Lupus finished because it tested the cell in column See here sells C 12 and it

56
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.590
found it blank.

57
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.520
So this is why the loop has finished.

58
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.440
So we've done it this way,

59
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.510
using to do until we could do it,

60
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.250
using the do while a swell.

61
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.100
But I need to change the condition here so that the value of the cell does not equal to

62
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.170
Blank.

63
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.820
OK,

64
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.970
so I'm gonna loop as long as the value of the Sun column C is not equal to blank.

65
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.250
So if I just delete these cells again here and I run the macro step by step as well.

66
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.550
And you can see here that I'm filling the cell here using to do while instead of a do until

67
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.070
and now when it actually tests the condition again.

68
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.470
And it found that this cell is blank.

69
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.000
So this condition is false.

70
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.750
Okay,

71
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.910
so it actually exited the loop as you can see her,

72
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.250
and we've ended the macro.

73
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.220
So this is an example here that we've managed to do using to do until and the do while as

74
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.510
well.

75
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.870
So that's it,

76
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.180
guys,

77
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.300
for this example.

78
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.980
Thank you very much.

79
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.350
Watching this video I'll see on the next one.
