1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,270
Okay,

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,500
guys.

3
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,060
So now we're going to speak about the workbook window resize events of the workbook window

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,060
.

5
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,400
Resize event gets triggered whenever you try to resize a window in the workbook that the

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,900
event is written for.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,010
So this event actually is written in the workbook ice cold workbook events.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,560
Okay.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,620
And I've got to windows open for it.

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,160
Now there's workbook events one and workbook events to.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,710
Okay,

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,230
if I'm just selecting the windows,

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,540
nothing is gonna happen.

14
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,710
But if I try to resize them,

15
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,080
you can see here The message box that have written in the event husband trigger to your

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,240
window has been resized whenever he tried to resize it,

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,530
you know the event will be triggered.

18
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:39,940
OK,

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,050
but if we go to another totally different work,

20
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,550
Bushes is another workbook than the workbook that the event is written for.

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,150
This is called Book Four,

22
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,770
for example.

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,640
And now if I try to resize that one,

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,730
nothing happens.

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,530
The event will not be triggered because the event is written in this workbook module for

26
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,480
the workbook that is called workbook events.

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,350
I typically don't use it a lot at all.

28
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,750
Perhaps they've never used it.

29
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,050
Never needed to use it.

30
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:16,390
But there is an application that you would feel that it's suitable for Please let me know.

31
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,780
You know,

32
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,450
the if you if you use it and it works for you and there's something useful that you would

33
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,130
use it for,

34
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,020
Please let me know.

35
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,010
I'll be interested to know it.

36
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,650
Okay,

37
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,160
thanks,

38
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,370
guys,

39
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,670
