00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
on this section off the cores were going to speak about error handling in xlv b A.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.780
So on the process off writing code in XlV B A and developing applications,

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.680
you are bound to get errors no matter what your skill level is as a developer.

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.140
And on this video,

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.910
we're going to have an introduction to are handling in xlv b A and we're going to learn

6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.620
about the different er types in XlV b A.

7
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.420
So in xlv A,

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.310
we've got three main types of errors that you might encounter.

9
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:44.300
We've got Syntex errors and we've got compile errors and we've got run time errors.

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.830
And to understand the difference between them,

11
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.110
we need to understand how vb a checks our code when we write our coat.

12
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.540
So VB A does three types of checks.

13
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.940
When we write our code,

14
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.190
the first type is syntax checks and the second type is compile checks and the third type is

15
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.750
run time checks.

16
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.070
So first of all,

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.580
starting with syntax checks,

18
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.040
these Syntex checks are basically like spelling and grammar checks if we relate that to

19
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.760
English language.

20
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.490
So when VB A checks your code on this type of checks on Syntex checks.

21
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.210
It asks the question.

22
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.520
Does your code have any spelling or grammar mistakes?

23
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.650
So it basically searches for any grammar or spending mistakes on your code.

24
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.730
So let's have an example.

25
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.340
For example,

26
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.790
here,

27
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.570
if you write workbooks and then molly workbook dot open,

28
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.970
you will immediately.

29
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.430
If you write it this way,

30
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.860
you will immediately get your code turn into red color.

31
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.320
So write it or quote,

32
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.860
turn into red color.

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.270
Here,

34
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.680
it's because we're having a spelling mistake,

35
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.070
which is basically not putting a second double quote after the word my workbook.

36
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.760
So the word my workbook needs to be enclosed in to double quotes.

37
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.680
We've got only one double court here on the left.

38
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.890
We don't have a closing double quote,

39
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.450
so this is in V.

40
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.640
B.

41
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.110
A's book is basically a spelling mistake,

42
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.620
and this is a syntax error,

43
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.040
and you will get notified about this error by having your code highlighted in red.

44
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.650
And this is because syntax checks are done in real time as you write your VB a code,

45
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.530
so if you make any errors,

46
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.940
you will get notified immediately by having your code turning into red.

47
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.790
The second type of checks is basically compiled checks.

48
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.340
So compile checks.

49
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.150
Ask the question.

50
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.090
Does your code make sense?

51
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.720
So this is actually kind of the question that v b a.

52
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.930
Us about your code.

53
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.500
Does your code make sense?

54
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.000
And this is done before attempting to run your coat.

55
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.670
So before your code starts to run and just after you hit the run button,

56
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.500
this check is done.

57
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.150
And if you have an error,

58
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.590
you will have an error that says,

59
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.480
Compile our and you will have the air and your code will not start to run.

60
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.270
The third type of checks that get done on your coat are basically runtime checks.

61
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.600
One time checks.

62
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.870
Ask the question.

63
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.170
Can what you need to do be done.

64
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.050
And this is done when your code is running while executing each line of code.

65
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.040
Okay,

66
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.770
so let's have an example for each type of errors in XlV B A.

67
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.420
So starting with Syntex Er's syntax errors are similar to spelling or punctuation errors in

68
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.460
English language.

69
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.620
So if you write in English,

70
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.230
I love chocolate and you write the spelling off chocolate incorrectly.

71
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.630
As I did hear,

72
00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.850
you're basically making a spelling mistake and this is similar to writing workbooks.

73
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.830
My workbook without a closing double court here dot open.

74
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.900
You made a spending mistake and your code will turn into red.

75
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.800
Okay,

76
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.280
so these air syntax errors compilers are basically errors where you have your spelling and

77
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.690
punctuation correct.

78
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.230
However,

79
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.280
the context that you're using the words in does not make sense.

80
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.910
Remember,

81
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.990
on compiled check,

82
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.250
we ask the question,

83
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.020
Does your code make sense?

84
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.900
So I'm gonna have an example here in the English language.

85
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.480
So if somebody tells you,

86
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.200
I fly my car to work every day.

87
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.730
Okay,

88
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.900
so this sentence,

89
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.460
I fly my car to work every day does not have any spelling earners,

90
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.870
and it does not have any punctuation,

91
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.520
er's and it's grammatically correct.

92
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.620
However,

93
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.270
this sentence does not make sense.

94
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.850
Why?

95
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.770
So what's the error?

96
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.740
What's the problem?

97
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.090
While the problem is,

98
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.660
cars cannot fly right,

99
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.450
at least not your average car.

100
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.680
I mean,

101
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.100
your average car does not fly.

102
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.770
You probably could have seen a science fiction movie where cars fly,

103
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.120
but for now,

104
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.840
at least,

105
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.450
your average car for now does not fly.

106
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.270
They could fly in the future,

107
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.280
but for now,

108
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.710
cars cannot fly.

109
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.940
So if we try to relate that to V B A.

110
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.880
This error can happen when you write a word that exists in the V B A dictionary,

111
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.490
however,

112
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.430
using it in the wrong context.

113
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.710
So,

114
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.270
for example,

115
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.760
if you're right,

116
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.550
workbook,

117
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.690
my workbook dot open.

118
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.490
So where is the problem here?

119
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.740
So this would generate a compiler.

120
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.510
Why?

121
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.900
Because having the word workbook is not correct In this context,

122
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.160
the word workbook does exist in the V B.

123
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.150
A dictionary.

124
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.200
So VB recognizes the word workbook and you will not get a syntax error.

125
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.720
However,

126
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.240
using it in this context is incorrect because you should use work books,

127
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.350
not workbook,

128
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.770
So this will result in a compile error.

129
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.510
So how would you fix that?

130
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.860
You need to make sure that you're using words in the right context.

131
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.670
Run time errors result from something that can be done normally.

132
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.710
So usually this thing that you're trying to do can be done normally.

133
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.430
But in this particular case,

134
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.510
it could not be done,

135
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:27.130
so this can result in a run time error and run time Errors result when you start running

136
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.800
your coat,

137
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.910
so actually you will have your runtime our on a certain line of code that has a problem.

138
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.330
OK,

139
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.130
so you will have it after your code starts to run.

140
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.520
So to relate that we're not going to relate it to English language because runtime ours are

141
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.730
more about actions,

142
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.760
not just words and languages will related to normal life for real life.

143
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.360
So,

144
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.090
for example,

145
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.590
if you try to drive your car with an empty gas tank,

146
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.270
so driving your car is something that can be done normally.

147
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.450
However,

148
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.180
in this case on Lee,

149
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.820
you could not do it because you did not have any gas in the tank.

150
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.520
So trying to do a valid action driving your car,

151
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.820
it's a valid action.

152
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.890
It's something that can normally be done.

153
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.640
However,

154
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.780
it cannot be done on this particular time or in this particular occasion because you did

155
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.000
not have any gas in the tank,

156
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.120
so v a.

157
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.350
This can happen,

158
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.940
for example,

159
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.450
if you're trying to select a work sheep that does not exist in your workbook.

160
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.080
So,

161
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.640
for example,

162
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.680
if you're right worksheets my worksheet that select,

163
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.490
however,

164
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.020
my worksheet does not exist in your workbook.

165
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.250
You do not have a worksheet called my work sheep.

166
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:55.870
So you will not get the air until you attempt to run this particular line of code that says

167
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.500
worksheets.

168
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.300
My worksheet does select.

169
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.190
So selecting the worksheet is a valid action.

170
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:07.760
You just could not do it in this particular case because the worksheet is not available in

171
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.380
your workbook.

172
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.420
Then you will get a run time error.

173
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.040
So how can you fix that?

174
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.950
You need to make sure that what you're trying to do can be done,

175
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.700
plus apply air handling in case it cannot be done.

176
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.900
That is,

177
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.170
if the work she does not exist.

178
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:32.090
Then write some code to create the worksheet before running that line of code that is going

179
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.210
to make you select the worksheet,

180
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.100
for example.

181
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.460
