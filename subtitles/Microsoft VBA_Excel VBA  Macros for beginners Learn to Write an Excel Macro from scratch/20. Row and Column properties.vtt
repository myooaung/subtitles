00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.290
in this video we're going to illustrate dot ro and the doctor column properties.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.870
So I've created a new macro here and use of procedure and have named a row.

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.110
Underscore column.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.280
We're actually going to illustrate the difference between the dot ro and dot column

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.890
property.

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.950
So let's say I'm just gonna write rains A to,

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.170
uh,

8
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.780
Roh.

9
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.350
Okay.

10
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.590
And I'm just gonna put that inciting message box.

11
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.450
Okay,

12
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.970
So put the inside a message box,

13
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.510
and if I run my macro,

14
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.270
what's gonna happen is that it's gonna give me the row.

15
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.630
Number four.

16
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.740
Sell A to this is sell a two.

17
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.410
Okay,

18
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.150
I'm just gonna color in yellow.

19
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.980
Eso sell a to is actually in the second row.

20
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.350
This is why he produces the number two.

21
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.270
Okay,

22
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.830
now,

23
00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.480
if I changed that and put it to be dot column when I run the macro well,

24
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.310
it gives me the value of the column property for that sell.

25
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.880
Sell a two is in the first column.

26
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.700
It's and it's in column a and column ease the first columns.

27
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.450
This is why it produces the number one.

28
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.410
Okay,

29
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.200
these air to simple properties,

30
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.210
But they're very powerful.

31
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.070
And you use them in your Mac rose a lot,

32
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.090
and they are very important to know.

33
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.370
And they actually the dot ro and the dark condom properties.

34
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.230
They were just exactly the same as the row function in Excel.

35
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.170
So if you give a cell to the row function,

36
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.200
it will produce the road numbers of giving it sell a to it produced to.

37
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.640
And also the column function and excel function is which is the column function.

38
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.780
If you give it a cell,

39
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.780
it will output the call number for that sells.

40
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.230
I've given it.

41
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.430
Sell A to it.

42
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.030
It's output it the column number,

43
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.730
which is one because sell a two is in the first call.

44
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.350
Okay,

45
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.520
two simple properties,

46
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.150
but they are very important to know.

47
00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.020
So,

48
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.570
thank you guys for watching this video and please follow me onto the next one.
