00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170
Hey,

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,470
guys,

3
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:00,980
welcome back.

4
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,850
So in this video,

5
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,540
we're going to have more examples for the for each loop.

6
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,050
So we're going to see how to loop through more types of objects.

7
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,470
Okay,

8
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,890
so let's see how to loop through a range of cells.

9
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,720
So a range of cells is a collection that contains cells.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,340
Because a range is a collection of cells,

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,080
the range does not contain anything but cells.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,840
So if we want to loop through a range of cells,

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,980
we need to first of all,

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,260
create a range object so dim see as range,

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,350
for example here and I named it see because it sends for cells.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,120
But you could name anything,

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,090
and then we would write a for each loop.

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,950
So for each see in range.

19
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:54,460
And let's say I want toe loop through the range of cells between a one and 18.

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:01,570
So range sells one comma one and cells turn calma.

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,290
One next see?

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,050
So this is our for each loop.

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,930
So first of all,

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,300
we will select that particular cell,

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,340
and then on that cell,

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,090
we could put,

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,020
for example,

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,050
the row numbers of cedar values equal to see dot ro.

29
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,020
So what's gonna happen here is that we're gonna loop through the range of cells between a 1

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,670
to 8 10 We're going to select each cell,

31
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,200
and we're gonna put the row number for that cell in that particular cell.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,360
So let's go through the coat step by step here.

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,930
So,

34
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,970
as you can see here,

35
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,310
looping through,

36
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,100
we're going to select cell A one.

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,030
Currently,

38
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,520
we are and sell a one,

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,430
and then we're gonna put one here in cell a one,

40
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:50,340
and then we're gonna go to sell a too and select it and we're gonna put two and sell a to.

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,820
And if we keep on executing the code here is gonna go through each cell and put the row

42
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,060
number for that particular cell in that cell.

43
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,380
OK,

44
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,870
so this is a simple example on how to look through a range of cells.

45
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,550
By the way,

46
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,630
if you remove here,

47
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,250
the line of code for creating an object variable has arranged.

48
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,480
This will work as well.

49
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,050
But on your code,

50
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,370
you will not have the 02 complete feature here.

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,950
So you will not have suggestions on what properties or methods are for that.

52
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,730
See object here that you're using.

53
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,990
And by the way,

54
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,640
XlV B A will still recognize this as a range object,

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,540
even if you don't declare it as a range object.

56
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,260
Because Exelby understands that if you are looping through a range of cells than each one

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,180
of them is a range or a cell,

58
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,800
basically,

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,650
so even if you do do not declare,

60
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,530
it will still work.

61
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,700
But,

62
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,230
of course,

63
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,050
it's a better practice to declare your variables.

64
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,300
Okay,

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,810
so let's have another example on how to look through workbooks,

66
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,180
so to move through workbooks.

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,180
It's the same idea as well.

68
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,330
So we will declare a workbook,

69
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,830
objects a dim WB as workbook,

70
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,470
for example.

71
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,890
So declare a workbook object variable.

72
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,300
And then we would say,

73
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,800
for example,

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,940
or each WB in workbooks next WB.

75
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,060
And please note that this would loop through workbooks that are currently opens of the

76
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,520
workbooks,

77
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,430
your looping through need to be already open.

78
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,300
So what we would do,

79
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,080
for example,

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,150
is that we would have a message box,

81
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,850
wb dot name,

82
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,520
and currently I've got to work books open.

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,460
I've got the workbook for the for next loop and the workbook for the four each.

84
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,960
Duke So if I run this step by step,

85
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,210
so if I step through the macro,

86
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,130
we're gonna display the name of each workbook.

87
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,160
So now we've got the for each loop workbook on,

88
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,750
then before next loop workbook and displayed their name.

89
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,470
And then there gnome or open workbooks.

90
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,450
So we're gonna exit the loop and and sub.

91
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,200
Okay,

92
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,130
so we've seen how to move through different types of collections.

93
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,990
We've seen out to look through worksheets and seen how to look through a range of cells.

94
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,660
And we've seen how to look through a collection of workbooks.

95
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,810
And this same concept can be applied to any other collection in Excel V B A.

96
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,440
So you can loop through a collection of pivot tables and you can also look through a

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,010
collection of charts and so on and so forth.

98
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,610
Also,

99
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:34,370
please note that you can use that exit for statement with the for each loop the same way

100
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,320
that you can use it with the four next loop so you can use the exit for to exit your loop

101
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,610
at any point.

102
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,070
So that's it,

103
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,340
guys.

104
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,420
For the for each loop.

105
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,590
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see you on the next one
