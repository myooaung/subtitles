00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
Hagos welcome backs on this video.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,720
We're going to discuss the workbook sheet,

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,310
deactivate event.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,890
So the workbook she deactivate event triggers whatever code you put in it.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,950
Whenever you deactivate any worksheet on your workbook.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,980
And also it has a parameter is called S H,

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,480
and this parameters Stipe is worksheet object.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,700
And it basically refers to the worksheet that you have just deactivated.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,540
She could have a message box,

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,230
for example.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,240
Here you have de activated and then a space,

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,830
and then we're gonna come Canton eight.

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,680
That on s h dot name.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,140
So now if I deactivated sheets all known,

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,790
she two.

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,140
If I activate T 28 for example,

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,050
is going to say you have deactivated she too.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:56,750
So that s H dot name refers to the name off the sheet that's just been deactivated.

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,230
You could also may be put in if statement to make it run on Lee for a certain sheet.

20
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:10,650
So you could say if a ch dot name is equal to sheet to then and then we're gonna have an

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:10,910
end.

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,550
If so,

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,270
if the name of the sheet is equal to sheet too,

24
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,980
and that means the name of the sheep There's been deactivated,

25
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,910
Goes Shh.

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,480
Refers to the sheet that's just been deactivated.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,890
So the name of the shed this just been deactivated is t two.

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,670
Then you would run the message box,

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,220
okay.

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:33,020
And make sure to write the name of the sheet with the same upper and lower case letters.

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,500
Because if you write the S at the beginning,

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,270
for example,

33
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,900
here of she to a small letter and here it's a capital letter,

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,170
it will not work.

35
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,770
So I'm gonna go to Xi to from she 28 you will see here that this code will not run because

36
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,550
the name of the deactivated cheat is not she too.

37
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,550
Okay,

38
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,780
But now,

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,440
because she to is the one that is active.

40
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,680
And if I deactivated,

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,770
the code is going to run because I put a condition that it would only run or the message

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,090
box,

43
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,560
I mean,

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,700
would only run if the name of the deactivated sheet is she to.

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,060
So you could do that.

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,670
Although,

47
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,000
actually,

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,060
you could just go ahead and write this code in sheet to in this sheet to events module here

49
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,060
,

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:25,460
have the select worksheet here and select deactivate on this way you can write whatever

51
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,480
could you want to write in?

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,060
The work should deactivate event for that specific sheet,

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,610
but,

54
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:30,970
you know,

55
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,930
sort of the way to do it.

56
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,010
And maybe you don't know the name with sheets.

57
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:42,660
Or maybe you have several sheets cold A have a having a certain ah prefix on them.

58
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:50,150
So maybe sales 1 may be Or and then there is,

59
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,520
ah,

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,690
sales to,

61
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,650
for example,

62
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,060
very sales to,

63
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,950
for example,

64
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,190
and sales three.

65
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,090
Okay.

66
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,440
And you want the code only to run.

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,380
If the the name of the sheet has the word sales in its weaken do that,

68
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,940
actually.

69
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:16,530
So this can be done by by doing what is called a wild card match.

70
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:16,920
Okay,

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,450
so this is something actually knew that we're gonna learn so you could write if it's h dot

72
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:31,740
name like and then you would open double quotes and then you would put an asterisk and put

73
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,850
the name the sheet that it would be like so its sales,

74
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,680
for example.

75
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,900
And this means that the name is going to contain sales in it,

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,320
and we're gonna put an Asterix assessed risk as well and then close the double quotes,

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,140
then maybe message box.

78
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,930
You have deactivated a sales sheets.

79
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,820
And actually,

80
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,870
when you do a wildcard match,

81
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,820
this uswest a day beginning means that the name,

82
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:10,220
the word sales could have something before it on this one means that the word sales could

83
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,550
have something after it.

84
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,610
But usually from searching for Ah,

85
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:20,240
a certain word I put put it as if it would have something before or something after it

86
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,030
could go more specific and ad only one of those two asterisks if you want.

87
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,560
So let's try that now if I deactivate any other sheets.

88
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,660
If I select cheat one,

89
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,400
for example,

90
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,090
actually,

91
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:39,020
of just the activity that a sell sheet which was sales ah three or sales to I don't

92
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,480
remember.

93
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,420
But anyways,

94
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,090
one sales sheet has been deactivated and this is why the message box has been triggered.

95
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,650
Okay,

96
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:53,350
and now if I deactivate this sheet one that does not contain the word sales in it,

97
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,650
nothing will happen.

98
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,190
OK,

99
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:03,610
but if I goto any other sales sheet and I deactivated and go to maybe sheet to hear from

100
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,950
sales 12 sheet too,

101
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,700
the code has been triggered,

102
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,420
so this will work with any sheet that has award sales in it,

103
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
for example.

104
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,750
Okay,

105
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,950
so this code is gonna work for any sheet that has the word sales.

106
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,800
Um,

107
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,550
I don't typically use this event a lot,

108
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,450
but if there's something that this event would prove useful for you to use it in,

109
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,600
please let me know.

110
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,630
I would be really interested to know it.

111
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,180
Okay,

112
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,790
so that's it,

113
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,400
Guys for the workbook sheet.

114
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,920
Deactivate event.

115
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,170
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
