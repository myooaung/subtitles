1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240
Hey,

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,530
guys,

3
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,180
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,230
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,440
we're going to speak about the four each loop,

6
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,970
so the for each loop enables us to loop through objects in a collection of objects.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:13,950
So,

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,560
for example,

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,760
we can loop through all the worksheets in a collection of worksheets or the worksheets

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,420
collection.

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,660
We can look through all the cells in a range because arranges essentially a collection off

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,320
cells.

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,950
We can move through all the workbooks in the workbooks collection as well.

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,830
We could look through all the charts in the charts collection,

15
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,800
so it enables us to loop through each object in a collection of objects.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,760
And usually you will have the relationship between the object and the collection as being

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,740
just a singular and the plural.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,070
So,

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,970
for example,

20
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,640
worksheet and work sheets worksheet is the object,

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,150
and the collection of objects is the work sheets collection.

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:05,790
Okay,

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,170
so it's gonna be pretty easy and pretty consistent in most of the cases.

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:19,250
So the structure off the four each loop is basically for each object in collection,

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,780
and then you would have some code to perform and then next object.

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,740
And here the object after next is optional you don't have to write the object.

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,840
So this is a structure for each object in collection.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,070
So for each worksheet in worksheets collection,

29
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,820
for example,

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,780
some code that you're gonna apply on it and usually you would have the object itself

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,340
referenced in that code.

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,190
So you're gonna,

33
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,970
for example,

34
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,120
display the name for that particular object.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,980
So for each worse sheet just worksheet name,

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:01,360
we put it inside a message box or debug dot print for that name or so and then next objects

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,360
.

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,750
This is the structure off the for each loop.

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,550
So let's see an example off the for each loop.

40
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,410
Okay,

41
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:08,650
guys.

42
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,930
So now we're gonna have an example for the four each loop and this example,

43
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,890
What it does is that it loops through all the worksheets in the active workbook.

44
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,040
So here,

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,730
first of all,

46
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,700
we've created an object variable that is called Ws,

47
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,630
and it's type is gonna be a you worksheet on.

48
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,770
Then you were saying for each ws,

49
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,840
which is basically a worksheet in worksheets,

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,520
and this worksheets would refer to the worksheets collection in the current active workbook

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:43,520
.

52
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:43,880
OK,

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
so this will work on the active workbook,

54
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,580
not a sense city on the workbook that the macro is is written in.

55
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,180
So you need to make sure that the workbook that you need to loop through its worksheets is

56
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,520
the one that is active.

57
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,660
If you want to make sure that you would look through the worksheets in the workbook that

58
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,010
the macro is written in,

59
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:12,540
you write this workbook dot worksheets or whatever work booked out worksheets,

60
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:12,980
OK?

61
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,160
And we've learned before how to refer to a workbook on previous videos.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,410
So this will make sure that you would loop through the worksheets in the workbook that the

63
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,670
macro is written in.

64
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,410
So what's gonna happen here when we lived through the worksheets?

65
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,840
We're gonna actually not select each worksheets because you're going to see here when we

66
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,970
loop through.

67
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,430
If you look on the bottom left corner here,

68
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,680
you're not going to see that the word sheets are being selected.

69
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,590
So looping through the worksheets does not essentially mean selecting OK,

70
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,550
so we will not select them.

71
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,470
We can do stuff to the worksheets.

72
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,980
The are allowed without selecting the worksheets.

73
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:59,730
But we do not have to essentially select um and then we have the next w s statement here

74
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,390
that basically enables us to go to the next worksheet.

75
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:11,960
And if all the worksheets are finished than we will basically exit the loop and ah,

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,920
please know as well that the ws part here is optional You don't have to write next Ws you

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,790
could right next.

78
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,700
But being explicit is a good practice.

79
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,250
Ok,

80
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,550
now let's run through the loop step by step here.

81
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:32,460
So I'm gonna press f eight whoever each worksheet in this workbook that worksheets and then

82
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,560
debugged apprint w esta name What this is going to do?

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,540
Is this gonna print the name of the worksheet in the immediate window here below?

84
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,400
So everybody execute this step.

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,090
We've started looping and we first of all,

86
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,270
look through she one as the first sheet to look through,

87
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,200
and we typed its name here in the immediate window.

88
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,910
And then we're going to move through the next seat and we take the name of sheet to and

89
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,040
notice here that she,

90
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,450
too has not been selected.

91
00:04:59,450 --> 00:04:59,970
Okay,

92
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,210
if you need to select the sheet than you need to type a statement that says ws star,

93
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,360
activate to activate the worksheet and then if we continue looping,

94
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,130
we would look through the third cheat and this is the lost sheet.

95
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,270
So we're not gonna loop anymore.

96
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,950
We're just gonna exit the for each loop and and sub.

97
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,790
So this is how you can look through worksheets in a collection of worksheets,

98
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,330
okay?

99
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,200
Or basically in a workbook.

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,860
Now I want to show you something else as well.

101
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,100
Which is what happens if you leave it like that.

102
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,140
As for each ws in worksheets instead of this workbook of worksheets,

103
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,420
instead of being specific,

104
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,250
what's gonna happen here is that you're gonna loop through the worksheets in the current

105
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,200
active workbook.

106
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,700
So currently got the workbook called for each loop that has sheets 12 and three as the

107
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,490
active workbook.

108
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,120
So we will actually have the names of these sheets typed here in the immediate window.

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,630
I've got another workbook,

110
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,030
that school book one here that has sheets called one x two x and three X.

111
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,560
Now,

112
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,260
if we go through the macro this way,

113
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,910
we'll actually type the names of sheets one x and two X and three acts because Book one is

114
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,190
the active workbook.

115
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,720
So here,

116
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,990
if you leave it like just worksheets.

117
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,060
And you don't specify in which workbook is just gonna loop through the worksheets in the

118
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,610
active workbook.

119
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,050
OK,

120
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,740
so basically,

121
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:30,510
it's a better practice to specify which workbook contains the worksheets that you need to

122
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,730
loop through.

123
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,550
Okay,

124
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,870
this is a better practice and is going to make you avoid problems on the next video.

125
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,970
We're going to see how to move through mawr objects.
