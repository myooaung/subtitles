00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
Okay,

2
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.010
guys.

3
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.950
So now we're going to discuss that before DoubleClick event.

4
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.950
So before the before double cook event basically executes goto in every double click,

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.560
click on a cell in the sheet that you have created the event force or in our case,

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.730
here,

7
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.770
we've got a sheet school before double click,

8
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.500
OK,

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.400
and we're going to see how that even works.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.890
But before doing that,

11
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.380
I just want to ask you a question.

12
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.940
What happens when you double click on a cell?

13
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.910
Let's try double clicking on a cell and observe what happens.

14
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.050
She can see her that when we double click on a cell,

15
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.240
we enter into edit mode for that cell so you can start typing stuff in the cell.

16
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.010
Okay?

17
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.600
Just getting delete that that's what happens.

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.420
That's the default action that happens when you double click on the cell.

19
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.840
So bear that in mind.

20
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.650
Okay,

21
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.040
so now we're gonna go to the events for the before double click she'd here.

22
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.320
I'm going to right click and then view code.

23
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.470
And then from this menu,

24
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.370
I'm going to select worksheet as usual.

25
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.150
And from this menu,

26
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.200
I'm going to select it before DoubleClick event.

27
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.050
I'm gonna delete this worksheet selection change event because we don't need it.

28
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.930
Okay?

29
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.500
And now we can start writing some code.

30
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.570
He can see her that there are two parameters for the before DoubleClick event.

31
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.430
There is the target,

32
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.350
which we all know what it is by now.

33
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.510
It is.

34
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.950
Ah,

35
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.150
a range object.

36
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.060
Okay,

37
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
that that refers to the cell that you actually going to double click on.

38
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.790
OK,

39
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.140
and there is the cancel.

40
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.980
I'm going to speak about that in a bit.

41
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.580
Okay,

42
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.770
So let's write an event to trigger some code when double clicking on a certain cell.

43
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.020
Okay,

44
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.890
so say we want to trigger that code.

45
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.390
If this cell is sell F three for double quick on cell if three.

46
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.650
I want to trigger some coat.

47
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.190
So say I want to create a message box.

48
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.700
Okay,

49
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.970
so I'm gonna first of all,

50
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.380
put a condition here if ah,

51
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.050
target dot,

52
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.950
dot address.

53
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.370
And I'm gonna put a full seer for the rule.

54
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.000
Absolute.

55
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.060
On the Colin upset,

56
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.450
you can put a zero as well.

57
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.150
So zero instead of full schools will work OK equals f three.

58
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.520
Okay,

59
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.290
then.

60
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.040
And let's not forget putting an end.

61
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.150
If than message box.

62
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.890
You double clicked.

63
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.860
Sell at three.

64
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.360
Okay,

65
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.290
so we're gonna have a message box here.

66
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.310
You double clicked cell F three.

67
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.960
So let's check that out.

68
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.480
So I'm going to double click on cell F three.

69
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.470
You can see here that you get a message box,

70
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.340
you double clicked cell F three.

71
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.050
Okay,

72
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.260
so that's what happens.

73
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.300
And you actually enter at it.

74
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.150
Mood as well.

75
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.910
Okay.

76
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.630
You see can see her that in addition to having the message box,

77
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.980
we've entered the edit mode and weaken right stuff in the cell.

78
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.010
Let's do that again.

79
00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.950
Okay,

80
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.550
so I'm going to double click on Cell of three.

81
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.070
You can see her.

82
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.500
I got a message box on.

83
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.170
I entered at it mode for the cell.

84
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.950
Okay,

85
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.350
Okay.

86
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.780
So let's go back to our code.

87
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.410
So wouldn't we double click to sell?

88
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.850
We get the message box and we entered edit mode.

89
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.210
So this is where the council comes into play because the cancel it's type,

90
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.010
it's it's an object that it's type is a bullion.

91
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.860
That means it can take values of true or false.

92
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.700
Okay,

93
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.100
the council can control whether we enter into edit mode or not.

94
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.050
Okay,

95
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.870
so if you put the council equals true,

96
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.630
we're not going to enter into edit mode.

97
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.260
So let's do that here.

98
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.260
If if you put,

99
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.170
cancel equals true.

100
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.490
And we try that again,

101
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.910
sell F three double click on it.

102
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.170
We get the message box.

103
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.340
But we didn't enter edit mode.

104
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.980
OK,

105
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.670
this is how the council works.

106
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.950
Or this is why the council exists so as to either enter into edit mode or not.

107
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.060
Okay,

108
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.230
so if at any point in your code you wanna go back to the default action for double clicking

109
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.320
on the cell,

110
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.310
you can put cancel equals holes,

111
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.200
and that would just put you back to the default action.

112
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.510
Okay,

113
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.550
It will negate.

114
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.400
Ah,

115
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.250
the council equals true line.

116
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.980
You consider a double click.

117
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.970
Okay?

118
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.810
And then we go to the default action.

119
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.450
Okay?

120
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.590
Okay,

121
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.810
guys.

122
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.640
So one more thing I want to tell you as well is what happens if we put a small laugh here

123
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.640
instead of a capital f on.

124
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.450
That's probably a mistake that people would do.

125
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.560
Ah,

126
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.720
thinking that it would work the same.

127
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.980
So let's try that.

128
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.400
Let's double click on cell F three here and you can see her,

129
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.360
and nothing happened.

130
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.680
The message boxes not appear because the event has not been triggered.

131
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.650
Okay,

132
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.170
so Ah,

133
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.690
that's a common mistake that people could do actually case to make sure that you put a

134
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.880
capital letter when using the dot address property.

135
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.060
Okay.

136
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.690
Okay.

137
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.490
So let's have a practical application.

138
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.150
Actually,

139
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.010
it's application that I've used personally,

140
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.830
which is when you double click on any of these names,

141
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.660
the name gets selected and gets put in another cell,

142
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.040
okay?

143
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.670
And have used this application on a dashboard before where you double click.

144
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.860
There would be a list of names.

145
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.330
You double click on them on any of them,

146
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.320
and then he would go to that cell,

147
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.370
and this cell would be linked to charts and stuff.

148
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.970
Okay,

149
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.840
so that it would give you stats about that name or the item or whatever,

150
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.360
you know.

151
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.040
So you select on item,

152
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.120
form a list by double clicking on it,

153
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.850
Okay,

154
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.250
so we can do that.

155
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.260
Okay,

156
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.870
so let's say the name is in this list,

157
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.950
okay?

158
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.270
And,

159
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.780
ah,

160
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.930
we can actually write code to select.

161
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.920
That's OK.

162
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.900
So if so,

163
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.440
if Target thought it's in column.

164
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.850
Oh,

165
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.950
Okay,

166
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:18.900
So if Target dog column equals Okay,

167
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.330
Colum O is the 15th.

168
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.120
So they started.

169
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.360
Our economy equals 15 and target.

170
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.140
We can actually put it between two rows.

171
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.620
Okay,

172
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.580
target dot ro is greater than or equal to,

173
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.080
and target dot ro is less than or equal to six.

174
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.270
Row is less than or equal to six.

175
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.650
Then we could put range.

176
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.780
L three is equal to target.

177
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.500
Okay.

178
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.420
And if so,

179
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.530
if I click anywhere,

180
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.050
if I double click anywhere,

181
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.850
he won't do anything.

182
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.380
But if I double click on one of those,

183
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.420
you can see here that it's been put in that cell here in south l three and you could put a

184
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.630
council equals true if you don't want to go into edit mode was probably this That is what

185
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.200
you would want to do.

186
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.050
OK,

187
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.760
so double click on the name,

188
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.910
it goes into that cell,

189
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:27.610
and maybe that cell would be linked to ah chars or to look at functions or whatever on your

190
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.210
dashboard.

191
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.460
OK,

192
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.170
so it's a way of selecting a name from a list,

193
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.750
and you could probably instead of ah,

194
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:39.550
having a certain defined ah boundary for for Rose Okay,

195
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.460
so maybe the number of roses is variable.

196
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.770
Okay,

197
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:49.440
Maybe your list could shrink or could expand to maybe get the lost row and do it this way.

198
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.970
Okay,

199
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.720
so that's a guy's further before DoubleClick event.

200
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.370
Thank you very much for watching this video.

201
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.950
I'll see on the next one.
