00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
Hey,

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,200
guys,

3
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,130
welcome back.

4
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,680
So in this video,

5
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:11,510
we're going to discuss adding and saving workbooks using XlV be a sotto adding new workbook

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:11,510
.

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,840
You just use the ad method with the workplace collection.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,480
So you write workbooks,

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,360
start add.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,990
So if you run this macro,

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,820
this actually opens a new workbook.

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,570
And this is similar to clicking on file here and then clicking on new or actually pressing

13
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,480
control and end on your keyboard.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,520
They're just opening a blank new workbook.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,450
You will notice also that the workbook start add method has an optional parameter,

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,270
which is actually template.

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,000
This template parameter allows you to open a workbook based on a template,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,710
and you need to actually provide the location off the template that you need to open the

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,440
new workbook based on.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,690
So I'm going to actually open a new workbook based on a template that I've got in my

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,700
templates folder.

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,950
So I need to paste the location of that template,

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,810
which is the default location for the Templates folder,

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,110
and it's called Sales Template and its extension is dot excel tm.

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,660
Of course,

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,900
your path could be different.

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,610
You can actually check the path of your templates by going to file and then going to

28
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,510
options and then on the save menu here,

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,960
you're gonna have your default personal templates.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,580
Location.

31
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,260
Okay,

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,150
So back to our visual basic environment.

33
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,270
So if I run this macro,

34
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,700
we're gonna open a new workbook based on a template,

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,710
which is my sale.

36
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,380
Stempler here safely run that you're going to see a new workbook husband opened based on a

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,440
template that I had created.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,490
So I'm gonna close that for now.

39
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:53,980
OK,

40
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,280
so to actually save the changes to a workbook,

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,510
you just use the workbook dot save method.

42
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:08,110
So if you want this workbook dot save this is actually going to save the changes to the

43
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,920
workbook that contains this macro,

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,860
which is called adding and saving workbooks.

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,050
So if I won this macro,

46
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,370
you're just saving the changes,

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:24,070
and that is similar to pressing control and as on your keyboard or going to file and then

48
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,750
safe.

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,210
Now I've actually activated the workbook that schooled book one that we've just opened.

50
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,130
But we haven't saved yet.

51
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,260
So this workbook has just been opened,

52
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,990
as we've seen by using the workbook start add method,

53
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:45,870
but it has not been safe to a location yet if you used the workbook dot save method on that

54
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,450
workbook.

55
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,670
So now this is the workbook active.

56
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,400
So if I use the active workbook to save method,

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,790
if I run that actually,

58
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,570
this workbook is going to be saved and it's gonna be safe to a location.

59
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,360
So actually,

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
we haven't been asked for the location,

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,710
as you could see here and the statement executed.

62
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,160
Fine.

63
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,550
So where has that workbook been saved while?

64
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:09,920
Actually,

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,330
it has been safe to the default location for saving workbooks for Excel,

66
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,370
which is usually the Documents folder.

67
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,860
So here is the my documents folder,

68
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,170
and you could see here.

69
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,850
Here is book One.

70
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:29,950
So this is why it's not recommended to use the workbook doubt save method to save newly

71
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,990
openwork books or workbooks that have not been saved yet because you don't get to determine

72
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,300
the location for saving the workbook.

73
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,970
And you also don't get too Name it with a certain name,

74
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,320
you know,

75
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,710
Let's say you don't want to name it with book one.

76
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,940
You want to give it another name,

77
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,720
so the workbook dot same method does not give you the option This is why it's also better

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,100
to use the workbook save as method,

79
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,750
which actually we're going to see on the next video.

80
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,800
So thanks,

81
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,050
guys,

82
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,350
for watching this video and I'll see you on the next one.
