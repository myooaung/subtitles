00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.380
Okay,

2
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.660
guys.

3
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.320
So now we're gonna have an example for the input box so we can write input box,

4
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.250
What is your name?

5
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.970
And that is the prompt argument.

6
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:19.490
And we could put the total as name and then the default value could be Please enter your

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.990
name.

8
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.280
So this is gonna be our input box.

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.440
So if you run that you can see here,

10
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.990
we've got the default value.

11
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.190
Us.

12
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.550
Please enter your name.

13
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.990
So we're using it to guide the user on what to enter.

14
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.800
If you press ok or press cancel,

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.130
nothing is gonna happen.

16
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.090
So I press cancel.

17
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.240
Nothing happened pressed.

18
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.770
Okay,

19
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.580
Nothing happened because we're still not set up the input box to capture the value that the

20
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.750
user inputs.

21
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.170
So,

22
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.260
in order to capture the value that the user inputs,

23
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.920
you could either put the value in a cell.

24
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.780
So say range a one equals whether user inputs,

25
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.590
for example,

26
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.530
or you could put it in a variable.

27
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.080
So dim your name as string.

28
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.260
So we're gonna make it a string because the input box actually outputs values as a string.

29
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.860
So this is why we're gonna make the data type of the variable to be a string.

30
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.010
Now we're going to set that variable to be equal to the input box.

31
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.350
So your name is equal to Input box.

32
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.180
And because the input box now is on the right hand side of an assignment operator of the

33
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.990
equal sign,

34
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.710
we will get an error this way.

35
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.720
So we need to put its arguments between brackets chicken.

36
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.410
See here.

37
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.770
Now we've got a variable called your name that whatever the user types into the input box

38
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.260
is going to go into the your name variable.

39
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.350
And then we can have a message box Hello?

40
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.060
And then a space and concoct innate that onto your name.

41
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.610
Okay,

42
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490
so let's try that input box.

43
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.610
So if you run that,

44
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.210
what is your name?

45
00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.330
I'm gonna enter mining,

46
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.650
for example abderaman and then click.

47
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.470
OK,

48
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.270
so is gonna display a message.

49
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.890
Hello,

50
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.170
Abderrahmane.

51
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.790
Now,

52
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.100
if we run it as well and instead of pressing okay,

53
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.670
we press,

54
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.130
cancel pressing,

55
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.000
cancel gives us a blank value or puts a blank very into the variable,

56
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.640
basically.

57
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.300
So when you press cancel,

58
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.980
we get just hello and blank,

59
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.860
because when you press cancel,

60
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.150
you just get a blank value,

61
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.460
okay?

62
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.010
So let's see some examples about dealing with the different scenarios for the user's input

63
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.010
.

64
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.570
So,

65
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.500
for example,

66
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.440
what if the user presses okay with the default value,

67
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.980
as please enter your name so we could have an if statement here.

68
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.960
If your name is equal to please enter your name,

69
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.500
then we will display a message box invalid value received.

70
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.570
Please enter your name.

71
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.020
Now What if the user enters a blank value or presses cancel so we could have else.

72
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.770
If your name is equal to Blank,

73
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.350
then message box name is mandatory.

74
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.000
Please enter your name.

75
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.740
Okay,

76
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.480
so now when we receive an invalid value or blank value from the user,

77
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.990
we are prompting him to enter his name.

78
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.230
However,

79
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.250
if you run the macro this way,

80
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.690
we're going to go through the if statement if the user does not give us a proper value.

81
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.650
But then we're gonna have the message box Hello and the improper value.

82
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.190
Right?

83
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.050
So we need to do something to redirect a user to go back and enter his name.

84
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.680
So let's run it and see what happens first.

85
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.620
So here it says,

86
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.710
Please enter your name.

87
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.860
So let's say I'm gonna press cancel.

88
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.830
So this way I've given a blank values so you can see her.

89
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.220
Now that there's a message box,

90
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.030
it says name is mandatory.

91
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.280
Please enter your name.

92
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.740
So if you press OK,

93
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.380
it's going to say hello and a blank family.

94
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.080
You right?

95
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.110
Because we've got the message box being executed here just after the if statement.

96
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.190
So we need something to adjust the flow so we could have a go to statement.

97
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.690
So go to start,

98
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.540
for example,

99
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.790
and we'd have this go to statement here is well,

100
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.350
okay.

101
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.350
And then we would have a starting point here.

102
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.790
Start.

103
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.290
So this way the user would be going back to the input box that prompts him to enter his

104
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.620
name.

105
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.380
So if you run that and then we would not enter a proper value.

106
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.900
So here,

107
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.970
if you press OK,

108
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.530
so this way we've entered,

109
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.570
Please enter your name,

110
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.320
which is not a proper value.

111
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.710
So says your invalid value received.

112
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.650
Please enter your name and then we go back to the input box.

113
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.310
This says what is your name?

114
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.840
So this way,

115
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.200
if I enter a proper value my name,

116
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.270
for example here and we've press.

117
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.950
OK,

118
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.830
would go to the hello message box.

119
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.540
Okay,

120
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:12.090
so this is one way of dealing with improper values or improper inputs.

121
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.020
The are given by the user.

122
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.870
So thank you very much,

123
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.100
guys,

124
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.790
for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
