1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Hey,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:01,880
guys,

3
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,400
welcome back.

4
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,270
So in this video,

5
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,220
we're going to see how to get to the next row.

6
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,820
And that is the row after the last row on our data set.

7
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,830
And we would want to do that in order to add new rose to our data set,

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,590
for example.

9
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,800
So how can we get the row number for the next row?

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,250
Well,

11
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,700
it's very simple.

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,650
You could just do the same one here,

13
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,890
the same for metaphor getting the last row.

14
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,110
Except that you're just gonna have a plus one.

15
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,110
So this formula for getting the last row yields an integer,

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,030
which is the last row if you had a +12 that you go to the next row,

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,690
right,

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,130
So then you can start typing values on the road that is the next euro.

19
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,430
So in our case here for start topping values,

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,690
we're going to start topping values on road number 20.

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,320
So you could write,

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,870
for example,

23
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,350
sells the rolling next number is gonna be an r,

24
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,040
then comma one,

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,060
we're gonna type in the first column,

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,120
which is the name we're gonna type,

27
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,860
for example,

28
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,540
Jack,

29
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:10,590
and then sells on our common to which is the day it's gonna equals date serial,

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,290
Listen to random.

31
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,960
They 2016 07 days.

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,780
05 for example.

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,350
I'm actually going to call people out here,

34
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,390
so Comma three is equal to we're gonna put an item Soul.

35
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,880
So say 15 on then The wonder is Comma Four,

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,770
which is for the fourth column to say we're gonna type the sales amount to be 100,000.

37
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,360
So if you run this code,

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,460
we're actually going to go through it step by step.

39
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,720
Here on our is equal to 20.

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,940
This is an extra.

41
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,160
We're going to start executing these statements,

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:54,650
so on the value for the next row and first column is gonna be Jack and then the dates and

43
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,200
then 15 and then 100,000.

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,070
Okay,

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,670
so this is how you can get the value for the next throw.

46
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,320
It's very easy now.

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,900
There is another way actually,

48
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,350
that people use sometimes subbed extra other way.

49
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,910
That's great.

50
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,400
And use of procedure here and what some other people do as well,

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,880
too go to the next row,

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,740
is actually using the range objects.

53
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,570
So range,

54
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,300
for example,

55
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,160
here on that.

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,380
Remember,

57
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,350
guys on the range object would just enter the reference for a cell.

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,390
So let's say we're gonna enter,

59
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,650
arrange a and then concoct any on that in the value of an R.

60
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,340
Okay.

61
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,150
And this way we got range for example,

62
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,040
a 21 because the next year we're going to type on is a 21.

63
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,760
So a 21 is gonna be equal to Jason.

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,450
Whatever.

65
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:56,800
And then we could do B and congratulated on an Are that's gonna be date serial,

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,170
whatever 2016 0403 for example,

67
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,620
And then range,

68
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,060
see,

69
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,860
and on our 1% and are is equal to 12 for example,

70
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,870
and then d m person and or is equal to 50,000 for example,

71
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,750
This is another way off,

72
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,090
actually referring to cells when you have variables,

73
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,170
although it's less common way and it's a less recommended way.

74
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,750
So using the cells collection object is better,

75
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,670
but sometimes people do that so they would refer to a cell.

76
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,130
If the road number is a variable,

77
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,960
do just concoct innate.

78
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,190
The column name,

79
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,260
which is your economy,

80
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,940
for example,

81
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,790
on using the UN percent on the N.

82
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,510
R and the n percent is actually used when you need to concoct innate texts and,

83
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,040
you know,

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,140
pieces tax on another piece of text and we'll see that a lot,

85
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,470
actually,

86
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,010
in the course.

87
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,270
And you do that in Excel in the normally Excel,

88
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,290
we need to concoct in a two piece of text on a piece of tax use.

89
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,740
The N percent as well.

90
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,990
You should be familiar with that case.

91
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,970
If you're on this code,

92
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,570
we're gonna have these values.

93
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,020
Spot on Road 21 cases is another way that people could write it.

94
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm just showing you that so that if you see in somebody else's schooled,

95
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,450
you wouldn't feel that is weird.

96
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,170
Okay,

97
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,410
guys,

98
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,250
So that's it for the next row.

99
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,120
Thank you very much for watching this video on.

100
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,550
I'll see on the next one.
