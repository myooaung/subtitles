00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
in this video,

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.790
we're going to discuss the if then else if structure,

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.710
so the if then else.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.090
If structure allows you to test not only one condition as we've seen before on the if,

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.710
then else and the simple if statement.

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.140
But actually it allows you to test multiple conditions and have multiple codes that were

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.860
result from any of these conditions being true,

8
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:35.370
you can add as many conditions as you like using the else if statement so basically,

9
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.840
the structure of the if then else if is basically if a condition is equal to true,

10
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.610
which is normal,

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.300
if you know you're gonna have some code resulting from that and then you're going to write

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.840
an else if then else if and then you're gonna put a condition.

13
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.640
And this else if condition just says that there is a condition is just a normal condition,

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.770
it's nothing special.

15
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.220
And then you're gonna test that this condition is equal to true,

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.480
and then you're gonna put it then and then you're gonna have some code that is going to be

17
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.460
executed in that condition is true.

18
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.240
You can also put another else if with another condition here,

19
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.570
testing that is true.

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.250
And if their condition is true,

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.650
you're gonna execute another set of code and you can put any number of else of statements.

22
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.970
And so here we've got else.

23
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.070
If else of condition and an end means that you can put any number of else of statements,

24
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.730
you could put first else if statement another else if statement 1/3 1 or fourth when you

25
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.310
can put any number of else of statements and test any number of conditions.

26
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.920
And if any of them is true than the code corresponding to that condition,

27
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.730
or the code under that condition is going to be executed and you can also put in else and

28
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.570
the else here gets executed if none of the conditions none of the conditions for the if or

29
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.310
the else if is true,

30
00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.420
if that's the case than whatever code under the else gets executed and the else here is

31
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.350
actually optional,

32
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.020
so you can have and if then else if without having the else part,

33
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.520
here's okay so this can be deleted.

34
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.510
This is optional,

35
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.050
and you need to make sure to put an end.

36
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.520
If,

37
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.430
of course,

38
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.400
so the if then else if structure allows you to put any number of conditions that you like

39
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.280
and you can also put in else.

40
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.450
And this else gets executed if none of the conditions tested is true.

41
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.630
And please note that if any of the conditions tested is true,

42
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.510
BB A will jump to the end F statement after executing its code.

43
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.980
So,

44
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.630
for example,

45
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.140
if we're testing conditions and the conditions for the first else,

46
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.270
if statement is true,

47
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.040
what will happen is that else if Code one is going to be executed and then vb a will jump

48
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.970
straight to the end if statement and execute any coat after,

49
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.710
it will not test the rest of the conditions.

50
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.230
Okay,

51
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.830
so once a condition is found to be true,

52
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:10.120
VB a exits the if then else structure and goes to the end if and execute any code after it

53
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.120
.

54
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.690
Okay,

55
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.530
so let's have an example for the if then else if structure Okay,

56
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.790
guys.

57
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.550
So now we're gonna have an example for the if then else if statement.

58
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.320
So,

59
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.820
basically,

60
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.310
we've got a very simple example.

61
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.780
You get here,

62
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.470
Selby,

63
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.590
18 having a value and we've got and if then else,

64
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.530
if structure here that I've written.

65
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.610
And basically this structure tests the value in Selby Eighteens on the first line here on

66
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.140
the if condition is gonna test if it is a one and if it's found to be true than is going to

67
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.900
play a message box that says one,

68
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.400
if it's not true,

69
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.880
then is gonna go on and test on the on this else.

70
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.460
If line here is gonna test if it's a two on effects,

71
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.150
the case exists.

72
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.190
Going to display a message,

73
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.450
Boxes says to,

74
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.530
However,

75
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.790
if it does not find it to be true,

76
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.380
is gonna test using the second else.

77
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.990
If here,

78
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.730
if the value is three and if that's the case,

79
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.960
is gonna display three.

80
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.200
And if it's not three is gonna just if it's a four and if it is,

81
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.130
then it's gonna explain message boxes.

82
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.400
Since for if not,

83
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.690
then it's just gonna execute the else which is gonna have a message box saying other value

84
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.690
.

85
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.330
So let's step through the code step by step.

86
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.760
Currently,

87
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.520
the value is a one social press F eight on your keyboard and start stepping through the

88
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.990
code here is gonna test here if the values one and it's gonna be true.

89
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.770
So we're going to display a message box that says one and then note Howard actually jumped

90
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.210
straight away to the end.

91
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.670
If line of code here because when it finds the certain condition is true,

92
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.410
it doesn't test the other conditions.

93
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.310
It actually jumps straight away to the end if and starts executing any code after the end.

94
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.850
If statement,

95
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:16.170
if we put it to here and test it so basically it's gonna test if the values of one it's not

96
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:23.300
gonna be a one is gonna test if it's to using this else if condition here and if that's the

97
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.770
case,

98
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.100
yes,

99
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.730
it is,

100
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.560
is going to display a message box to and then it jumps straight away to And if and if we

101
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.250
actually put a five in here,

102
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.930
which is not equivalent to any of the conditions that are gonna be tested,

103
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.890
you're going to see here that is gonna test older conditions,

104
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.580
and it's gonna find them to be fools.

105
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.720
So it's gonna execute actually,

106
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.840
the else statement here and it's gonna display a message.

107
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.650
Boxes says other value.

108
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.370
Also,

109
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.690
I want to show you the part.

110
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.940
When I told you that the else statement is actually optional.

111
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.620
So I want to run the code without the else statement.

112
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.590
And you can see here that the value here in Selby 18 is a five,

113
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.200
so it's not gonna meet any of these conditions.

114
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.430
So what's gonna happen in that case is that it's gonna testable conditions and is gonna

115
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.890
find them to be fulls.

116
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.030
So it's gonna end if it's gonna go to the end if statement,

117
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.670
because there is no else.

118
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.050
And then it's gonna execute anything after the if statement.

119
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.110
So in that case,

120
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.550
we did not take any action based on any of the conditions because none of the conditions

121
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.680
were true.

122
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.410
Okay,

123
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:41.090
So sick guys for the F than else if structure Thank you very much for watching this video.

124
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.390
I know.

125
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.620
See on the next one.
