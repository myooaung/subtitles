1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260
Hey,

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,540
guys,

3
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,100
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,140
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,940
we're going to speak about how we can add sheets to our workbook.

6
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,440
So,

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,910
basically,

8
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,970
to add sheets to your workbook,

9
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,910
you can type sheet,

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,480
start,

11
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,130
aunt,

12
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,930
and you can also alternatively type worksheets dot Add as well.

13
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,560
So worksheets start ad will add sheets and sheets.

14
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,430
Thought ad will also add sheets.

15
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,460
And we will actually explain the difference between the worksheets collection and the

16
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,300
sheets collection on the next video.

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:31,870
Okay,

18
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,390
so don't worry about that at the moment.

19
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,080
Now,

20
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,310
if you write sheets,

21
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,630
start,

22
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,190
add and then press space on your keyboard.

23
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,730
Ah,

24
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,450
bunch of parameters are gonna appear here on the tool tip you could.

25
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,020
Also,

26
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,390
instead of pressing space,

27
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,050
you could open a bracket and these parameters air going to appear as well.

28
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,820
And then you can write your parameters and close brackets,

29
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,150
and you're gonna be able to add sheets.

30
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,330
Okay,

31
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,460
so let's say we typed sheets dot ad and then we press space.

32
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,730
You'll have some parameters here that will appear for you.

33
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,270
So we've got the first parameter here.

34
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,670
The before parameter.

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:20,320
The before parameter allows you to add a sheet before a certain worksheet okay or before a

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,050
certain sheet.

37
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:27,080
So you will actually give that parameter the reference of the worksheet that you need to

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,160
add the new sheet before it.

39
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,770
So let's say we want to add the new worksheet before she too.

40
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:40,450
So we would write worksheets and then she to in the value for the before parameter.

41
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,290
And then if we press comma,

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,090
if you type a comma here on your keyboard,

43
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,650
you will go to the after parameter,

44
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,390
which works exactly as the before parameter,

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,080
except that you will actually give the reference of the sheet that you need to insert the

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,550
new sheet after it.

47
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,570
OK,

48
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:04,550
but you cannot actually use the before and after parameters at the same time.

49
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,750
So it's either the before or the after,

50
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,920
but you can't use both.

51
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,120
At the same time,

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,510
you will get an error,

53
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,320
so if you put another comma,

54
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,780
you will go to the count parameter and the count parameter takes a number,

55
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,570
and this number indicates how many sheets you want to insert.

56
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,870
So if you put you know one,

57
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,110
you will have one sheet inserted and one is the default value.

58
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,170
If you put too,

59
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,020
you will have two sheets inserted and so on and so forth.

60
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:42,250
So let's say we're gonna put a to here so that we can answer two sheets at the same time.

61
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,730
And then if you put another comma,

62
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,010
you will go to the type parameter,

63
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,920
which we will explain in a bit.

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,530
Okay,

65
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,280
So don't worry about it at the moment,

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,510
I'll just remove the comma for it here.

67
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:59,900
And you can also see that all the parameters here are optional because they all have square

68
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,990
brackets around them.

69
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,890
And that means that you do not have to provide these parameters for the sheets,

70
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,050
that ad or the worksheets dot ad method to work.

71
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,700
Okay,

72
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,120
so we've written it this way,

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,380
and this sheet start add line of code will actually add two sheets before she too.

74
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,650
So if you run that,

75
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,110
you will have two sheets added before she too.

76
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,450
So on the left hand side of she to actually sheet for and she five have been added.

77
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,250
As you can see here,

78
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,030
however,

79
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,780
if you type your code this way,

80
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:42,550
it will not be easy undescended ble for other people who read your code because people do

81
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,990
not normally memorize the order off the different parameters.

82
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,810
So you're here.

83
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,060
You haven't specified your parameters explicitly.

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,720
Okay,

85
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,600
so it's a better coding practice.

86
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,940
It's a better practice to actually explicitly specify your parameters.

87
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,700
So to write,

88
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,370
for example,

89
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,970
before colon equals work she cheat to on.

90
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,920
Then you would write a comma,

91
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,690
for example,

92
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,510
and then count colon equals to.

93
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,540
So this way,

94
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,130
whoever reads your code will understand that you're trying to add some new sheets.

95
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,220
Okay,

96
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,460
one sheet or more.

97
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,680
You're trying to add them before she too.

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,650
And you're trying to add two sheets.

99
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,340
Okay,

100
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,420
so anyone who reads this goat is gonna be able to understand what you are trying to do.

101
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:40,830
So it's a better coating practice in general to explicitly specify your parameters.

102
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,810
This way with the colon equals and remember,

103
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,150
guys,

104
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,200
parameters are like adverbs.

105
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
They explain how the verb is done.

106
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Okay,

107
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,230
So the verb here is the ad.

108
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,280
The ad method is considered are verb,

109
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,960
and our adverbs are before and the count they describe how the method or the verb is gonna

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,550
be done.

111
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,420
Also,

112
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,740
one of the benefits of explicitly specifying your parameters is that you do not have to

113
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,380
type them in the same order as the order specified on the sheet.

114
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,470
Start add method.

115
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:15,820
So,

116
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,550
for example,

117
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,560
here we could write the count parameter before the before parameters would write.

118
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,360
Count equals two comma before equals worksheets.

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,170
She too.

120
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,820
So this way the macro will work as well.

121
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,890
So if you run that,

122
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,480
we will have two sheets instead of before she to here on the left hand side of the sheet to

123
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,620
and actually outer sheet four on the right hand side of sheet for.

124
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,580
So if you run that,

125
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,270
you will see here that sheet six and cheat seven have been inserted before she to.

126
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,130
Okay,

127
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:52,900
so that's another benefit of explicitly specifying your parameters that you do not have to

128
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,250
right thumb in the same order that is specified by the method.

129
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,480
Okay,

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,880
so let's move on to the type parameter.

131
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,400
So we're gonna write type calling,

132
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,750
equals on,

133
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:11,620
then actually to have a list of the she types you're going to write excel sheet type,

134
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,370
and then a dot and then you will have the options for the different she types that you can

135
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,070
insert.

136
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,650
Okay,

137
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,320
there is actually something called the chart sheet,

138
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,920
Okay.

139
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,010
And if you run that,

140
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,990
we'll actually have to charge sheets inserted before she too.

141
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,660
So they're gonna be inserted on the left hand side of she too,

142
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,500
And on the right hand side of sheet six.

143
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,270
So,

144
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,710
as you can see here to charge,

145
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,290
sheets have been inserted,

146
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,820
and this is actually reflected when you right click on any sheet and click on insert,

147
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,930
you will have the different cheat types that you can insert here.

148
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,960
There's a chart cheat.

149
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,100
There is a macro sheet,

150
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,610
so there is actually on option to insert a macro sheet as well.

151
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,420
So except she type,

152
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,850
there is a democracy which you probably have never used.

153
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,060
And we don't use these regularly.

154
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,680
Charge cheetahs well,

155
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,850
is really used.

156
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,510
But I just thought of letting you know that there is an option to do that in v B A.

157
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,440
Okay,

158
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,440
so now you know how you can select a different she type.

159
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
The default value is actually excel worksheet.

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,870
So that means that if you don't specify the type and as we've seen before,

161
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,190
the default she type is the normal worksheet that we are all familiar with.

162
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,630
Okay,

163
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:28,880
guys.

164
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,450
So Let's see how we conduce something else.

165
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,850
I'll just comment this line of code so that you would not be executed.

166
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,610
And something else that we can do is that we can actually insert in you sheet before the

167
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,280
very first sheet in the workbook.

168
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,350
And the very first sheet in the workbook is actually the sheet on the very left hand side.

169
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,490
So remember guys,

170
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,020
when we were speaking about one way off selecting an object from a collection which is

171
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,750
using its index number,

172
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,450
and we said that this is not a very favorable way of doing it.

173
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,950
When we were speaking about the example of kicking the first bowl,

174
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,860
regardless of what the bull is.

175
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,800
And if the bowling bowl is the first bowl on the very left hand side,

176
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,500
then this is actually gonna hurt right or something is gonna go wrong.

177
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,900
So here we're actually going to do that.

178
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,850
We're actually going to select a sheet based on its position,

179
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,510
okay?

180
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,810
Not based on its name.

181
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:32,490
So we're actually gonna add a new sheet before the very first sheet on the workbook,

182
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,950
which is the sheet on the very left hand side.

183
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,190
We're gonna write sheets start,

184
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,660
add and they're gonna put a space and then before colon equals sheets and then open

185
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,340
brackets and then one and then close brackets.

186
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,050
Okay,

187
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,320
so this means that actually,

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,210
we're gonna add a new sheet before the very first worksheet in the workbook.

189
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,850
And the very first worksheet is the sheet on the very left hand side.

190
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,350
So if you run that,

191
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:05,610
you will see here that sheet eight husband inserted before she three which was the very

192
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,660
first sheet on the workbook Are the sheet on the very left hand side on?

193
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,060
Of course,

194
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,050
Onley One sheet has been inserted,

195
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:19,030
although we haven't specified the count because the default value for the count is one.

196
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,750
Okay,

197
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,810
OK,

198
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,400
something else that you can do.

199
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Another Turk that you can learn is actually to add a new worksheet after the last

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,270
worksheets in your workbook.

201
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:32,950
OK,

202
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,710
so the last worksheet on your workbook is the sheet on the very right hand side here of

203
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,420
your workbook.

204
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,030
So to add a new worksheet after,

205
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:48,780
we're gonna use the after parameter and we're actually here to specify the number we're

206
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,040
gonna use the sheets,

207
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,150
start count property,

208
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,160
right,

209
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,990
Because the sheets dot count property will yield the number of sheets that are in our

210
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,750
workbook.

211
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,240
OK,

212
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,420
And this will work regardless of the number of sheets.

213
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,910
So this is something that will make it dynamic.

214
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,970
When use the sheets start count because you're always guarantee that in you sheet will be

215
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,060
added after the last worksheet on your workbook,

216
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,910
which is the sheet on the very right hand side of your workbook.

217
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,010
And you could make it the before as well.

218
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:28,380
So this will make and you should be added in the place just before the last one.

219
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:28,970
Okay,

220
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,780
all the time.

221
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,520
So if you run that,

222
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,130
you will see here that a new sheet will be added after the lost worksheet in your workbook

223
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,130
.

224
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,520
And if you're running again,

225
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,330
sheet knowing has been added.

226
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,200
So if you're on again,

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,790
you will see she done added after it and so on and so forth.

228
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,880
Okay,

229
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,220
so this will add in you worksheet to your workbook in the very last position,

230
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,070
which is in the position on the very right hand side,

231
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,050
regardless off the number of sheets on your workbook.

232
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,950
Okay,

233
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,040
so that's it,

234
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,900
guys on how to add worksheets.
