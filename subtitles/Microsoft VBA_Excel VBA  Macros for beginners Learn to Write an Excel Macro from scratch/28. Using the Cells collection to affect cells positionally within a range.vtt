Hey,

2
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.530
guys,

3
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.920
welcome backs in this video.

4
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.390
We're going to see how we can affect cells.

5
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.240
Position Lee within a range.

6
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.890
Okay,

7
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.260
so what does that mean?

8
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.890
Well,

9
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.700
basically,

10
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.750
you can use the cells collection object to affect a certain cell within a range.

11
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.260
And what that means is that you can select a range of cells and you can say that you want

12
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.620
to put a certain value in the fifth cell for examples who put the value of 100 in the fifth

13
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.310
cell,

14
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.040
for example,

15
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.280
and you can make it in the sixth cell in the seventh cell in the 10th cell if this range

16
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.450
contains 10 cells or more.

17
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.920
Okay,

18
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.850
so how do we know what the fifth cell,

19
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.520
for example,

20
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.840
within a range is or how does excel determine that?

21
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.170
And how does the counting happen?

22
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.590
Does it happen from left to right or from top to bottom?

23
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:04.270
And let's say that you finished the cells within a line in a range or in a row and arrange

24
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.270
,

25
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.470
Do we make the cell below it the next cell?

26
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.950
Or do we start from the very left on the new row?

27
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.260
Or how does that happen?

28
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.450
Well,

29
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.930
basically,

30
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.930
how the counting works is that we start counting from left to right.

31
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.460
And then when we finish one row within a range with start counting the following cell from

32
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.320
the following grow with from the very left,

33
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.870
actually.

34
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.370
So this is how the counting work.

35
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.660
So we finished the cells in that row.

36
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.750
Let's say that the ranges from 81 to d seven,

37
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.430
for example.

38
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.110
So if we want to get the sixth cell,

39
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.890
for example,

40
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.230
so would count 1234 and then the fifth is actually sell a two.

41
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.790
And then it's Selby to basically this is the sick cell within that range.

42
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.140
Okay,

43
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.760
so let's have an example.

44
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.230
Basically,

45
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.980
you say I write sells eight.

46
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.050
Value is equal to 100.

47
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.850
Okay.

48
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.410
And when I write cells and then I write on Lee just eight between brackets.

49
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.730
What that means is that I'm actually counting eight cells starting from sell a one because

50
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.620
I'm actually selecting all the cells in the sheet,

51
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.010
and I'm starting to count.

52
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.700
Eight cells and the first cell in the Ch'tis actually sell a one.

53
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.100
So this is going to count.

54
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.850
12345678 So it's gonna be put in Sell H one basically.

55
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.330
And remember,

56
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.670
guys,

57
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.770
when we were speaking about how we can determine which member of the collection we select

58
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.820
or we deal with the beginning of the course and we actually put the example for sheets and

59
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.890
we were writing sheets a dot activate,

60
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.620
for example.

61
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.590
So we said that it will actually select the eighth sheet.

62
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.310
OK,

63
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.390
but the problem is that the sheets could change positions.

64
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.840
This is not a good way to select cheats,

65
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.570
but in case of the cells,

66
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.420
their cells will not change position.

67
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.480
So this is not going to cause an issue.

68
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.550
OK,

69
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.730
but anyways,

70
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.410
you probably won't do that for all the cells.

71
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.160
You probably do it in a search and range,

72
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.990
but this is just a example.

73
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.640
So,

74
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.950
actually,

75
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.190
what is gonna happen in this case is that it's gonna put the value of 100 in the eight cell

76
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.850
in the cells collection objects is gonna come.

77
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:45.290
12345678 So she run that you could see her that sell H one has acquired the value off 100.

78
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.800
Okay,

79
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.820
so let's have another example.

80
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.180
Let's say we write Range a 12 de 12 cells.

81
00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.130
15 dot value is equal to 100.

82
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.870
Okay,

83
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.190
so where is range?

84
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.620
A 12 d 12.

85
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.150
This is actually range A 12 D 12.

86
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:15.180
So what that is going to do is that it's gonna put the value of 100 in the 15th cell within

87
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.850
the range.

88
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:26.570
So the 15th So it's gonna be 123456789 10 11 12 13 14 15.

89
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.950
So it's gonna be cell C four.

90
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.940
So if you run that,

91
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:38.340
you will see here that cell C four has acquired the value of 100.

92
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.090
Okay,

93
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.360
guys.

94
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.930
So this was how you can affect a cell within a range,

95
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.690
depending on its position.

96
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.260
So this is how you can deal with a certain cell within a range,

97
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.830
depending on its position?

98
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.570
I haven't needed to use that a lot,

99
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.380
but in case you need to use it or in case you read it in somebody else's code,

100
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.960
you be ableto understand what that means.

101
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.550
Okay.

102
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.930
So ah,

103
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.220
thanks,

104
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.070
guys watching.

105
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.630
And I'll see you on the next one
