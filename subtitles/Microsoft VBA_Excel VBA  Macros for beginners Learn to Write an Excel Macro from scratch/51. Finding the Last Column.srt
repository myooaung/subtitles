00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
Hey,

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:00,630
guys,

3
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,410
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,840
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,500
we're going to explain how to get the loss column on your data set using Excel VB eight.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,440
So getting the loss column in your data set using XlV be a involves three main steps.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,550
The first step is to actually start at the Lost column in Excel,

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,240
which is column number 16,384.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,830
And then the second step is to actually press control and left on your keyboard to hit the

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,720
loss column on your data set.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,250
And then the third step is to actually ask what column on my on.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,740
So it involves three main steps just like getting the loss throat.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,130
It's the same idea.

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,910
We're just doing it in a different way.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,260
So let's see how we can apply that using code.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,480
So if Grady here,

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,650
ah variable have declared a variable called L C as an integer,

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:02,570
and you can safely declare as an integer because the number of columns in Excel or actually

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:10,520
16,384 and they are less than the 32,000 something maximum value for the interview data

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,810
types Utkan safety,

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,010
the clear as an integer without worrying about the loss column going over the limit and to

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,950
get the loss column.

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,430
It's just gonna be the same idea we implemented on getting the last row.

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,400
It's just implemented in a different way.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,070
Okay,

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,170
so to get the lost com,

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:32,400
we're going to write cells and then the row that we're starting at.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,610
It's better here to start at the first stroke,

29
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,360
because the first stroke contains your column headers and your table's gonna always contain

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,900
headers.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,920
So you're going to guarantee that you get the correct loss column just as we've explained

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,170
on getting the last row.

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:53,100
That is better to start on a column that you are always guaranteeing to have data on.

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,910
Okay,

35
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,210
so here it's better to start on a road that you're always guaranteed to have.

36
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:58,650
They don't.

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,350
So we're going to start to choose.

38
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,110
We're so we're going to choose to start on the first row,

39
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,440
and then the column index number is gonna be actually columns dot count.

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,100
Okay,

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,050
because we want to start at the Lost column in Excel.

42
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,100
So the column number for that is gonna be columns dot count,

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:27,650
and then it's gonna be dot end instead of excel up is gonna be excel to left and then it's

44
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,860
gonna be dot column So we're doing actually,

45
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,120
the three main steps that we've explained.

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,540
First Step is to start from the loss column in Excel,

47
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,930
which weaken go to by writing sells one columns,

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,380
columns,

49
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,510
start count and it's gonna be the cell in the loss column and in the first row as well.

50
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,210
Okay,

51
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,320
and then dot and excel to left.

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,600
This is the step when we press control and left on a keyboard.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,710
And then the third step is to ask which column on my on.

54
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,370
And this is the part that represents thirst.

55
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,990
Step the dot column property were asking for dark column property,

56
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,030
which represents what column are you on?

57
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,250
So now if we go through this micro step by step here.

58
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:19,040
So when we execute this line of code for l see,

59
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,140
you can see here that the value of L Z is equal to four.

60
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,310
Our loss column is the fourth column INCHES column D.

61
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,000
So I sit.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,750
This is how you can get the loss column on your data set.

63
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,050
Okay,

64
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,630
so Ah,

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,050
that's it,

66
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,430
guys,

67
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,200
Thank you very much for watching this video,

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,850
and I'll see on the next one
