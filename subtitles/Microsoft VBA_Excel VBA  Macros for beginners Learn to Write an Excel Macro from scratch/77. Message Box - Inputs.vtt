00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hey,

2
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.600
guys,

3
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.370
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.690
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.200
we're going to speak about the three arguments for the message box that we're gonna focus

6
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.470
on,

7
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.590
which is the prompt and the buttons and the title.

8
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.200
And we're going to especially focus on the buttons because the buttons is basically the

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.300
bread and the butter for the message box function,

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.140
because the prompt and the title are basically straightforward.

11
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.190
So the buttons argument actually has different groups of values or different groups off

12
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.670
Constance that you can use.

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.280
So this blue group here,

14
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.200
for example,

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.890
controls what type of buttons appear on your message box,

16
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.760
and this green group controls what type of message icons appear on the message box.

17
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.650
So whether you have this error one or you have this exclamation or information or question

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.180
the yellow group they control Which button is the default button and the default buttons

19
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.760
basically the button that is highlighted when the message box appears and this button will

20
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.320
just get clicked straightaway if you press space or enter on your keyboard.

21
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.450
So if you press space or enter when your message box appears just straight away without

22
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.900
thinking,

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.920
this is the button that's going to be executed.

24
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.890
So this controls what button is gonna be The default button is gonna be highlighted and

25
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.770
ready for you to press.

26
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.480
However,

27
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.980
off course,

28
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.710
you can choose any other button using your mouths or using the direction keys on your

29
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.410
keyboard.

30
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.990
But these just control which button is gonna be the default button.

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.060
The red group.

32
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.530
Actually,

33
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.320
we're not going to discuss because three of the Red Group are not working,

34
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.890
at least in my experience of the VB application.

35
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.930
Motile on the VB system motor on the VB message box at foreground.

36
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.930
These air functions inherited from visual basic from the visual basic language used to

37
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.310
create desktop applications and have tried them,

38
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.470
and they didn't make any difference to me and we're not going to discuss them.

39
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.550
The VB message Help Button is related to the help file on context arguments here,

40
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.710
which are obsolete.

41
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.550
We're not going to discuss that as well,

42
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.460
and these actually are not used Bari 99% or even more of the users who use message boxes.

43
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.410
I haven't seen them being used,

44
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.890
so we will not need them.

45
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.250
The White Group here,

46
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.430
the b,

47
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.890
the message box right?

48
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.060
And VB message box RTL reading the 1st 1 Here we be Message box,

49
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.350
right?

50
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.570
Just makes your text align to right.

51
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.600
And this will be applied to both the title and the prompt,

52
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.050
so it will just make them get a line to the right On the VB message box.

53
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.350
RTL reading specifies that the textured appear as right to less reading on Hebrew and

54
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.000
Arabic system.

55
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.080
So it enables you to basically specify that you're going to right from right to left eso

56
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.670
that is useful in case you're going to write in Hebrew or Arabic,

57
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.450
which is my native language.

58
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.410
So this is gonna be useful in that case.

59
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.070
Okay,

60
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.870
so let's have an example for the message box to illustrate thes functions.

61
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.900
Okay,

62
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.200
so let's have an example for the message box.

63
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.900
So that's a message box.

64
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.840
I love chocolate.

65
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.350
So this is the simplest form of a message box.

66
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.250
It contains only a prompt.

67
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.260
And if you run it,

68
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.430
you will have just the prompt.

69
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.550
The title is gonna be the default title.

70
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.740
Choose Microsoft Excel.

71
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.080
But you can change that and you'll notice here that you've got on OK button.

72
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.020
So the reason we've got on OK,

73
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.930
button is that if we just put a comma here,

74
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.350
you will see that the buttons argument has a default value of V B.

75
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.760
Okay,

76
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.220
Onley.

77
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.160
So the VB okay only is the default value that if you do not modify the buttons argument,

78
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.370
you will have a VB okay only or Justin.

79
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.700
Ok,

80
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.060
Button.

81
00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.720
We can put a different set of buttons so we could have for example vb.

82
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.390
Yes,

83
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.670
No,

84
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.130
cancel for example.

85
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.970
So this will display a yes no and cancel settlements.

86
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.170
If we just run that you can see here will have I love chocolate.

87
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.570
Yes,

88
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.540
no cancel.

89
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.580
And if you click on any of them and doesn't make any difference because we are not putting

90
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.890
any coat to capture the user's input,

91
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.630
which we will learn how to do shortly.

92
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:34.590
So now we've added just one input for one group or one category of inputs for the buttons

93
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.070
argument,

94
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.170
which is this blue category here which controls which buttons appear on your message box.

95
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.920
Okay,

96
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.080
so we've put an input from one category which is the blue category.

97
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.480
If you need to add another input from another category,

98
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.380
you need to put a plus sign and you will get this drop down menu again to start selecting

99
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.670
an input from another category.

100
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.540
And please note that you cannot put two inputs from the same category except actually from

101
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.150
the white category here because thes two input do not cause a conflict.

102
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.360
So you cannot put two of the blue to the green or to the yellow.

103
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.010
Okay,

104
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.580
so after putting a plus sign,

105
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.830
we can select something from the green categories.

106
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.890
So for example,

107
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.190
VB information.

108
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.670
So this will have yes,

109
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.870
No cancel buttons.

110
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.850
And also it will have the VB information this eye icon here,

111
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.450
and notice that the VB information has a sound effect that you've heard just now when it

112
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.430
appears and there is also the VB default button 12 or three or four here,

113
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.010
this yellow category.

114
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.310
If you put a plus sign,

115
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.470
you can put something from that categorias well,

116
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.970
so here this just specifies which button is gonna be the default buns gonna be highlighted

117
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.970
.

118
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.560
So if we select one,

119
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.130
for example,

120
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.180
VB default but in one and we run that you can see here that the yes button here is the one

121
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.110
highlighted if you press space on your keyboard or enter,

122
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.010
stayed away without doing anything.

123
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.970
This is the button that's gonna be the selected.

124
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.320
Of course,

125
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.680
you can select another button by pressing your direction keys on your keyboard or selecting

126
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.550
it with your mouse.

127
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.710
So this is what the yellow category does.

128
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.360
Basically,

129
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.110
the white.

130
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.080
One year they be message box,

131
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.340
right?

132
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.860
For example,

133
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.070
if you put a plus in select VB message box,

134
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.310
right,

135
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.780
it's just gonna make your text the line to the right.

136
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.230
So I love chocolate and also the title are now aligned to the right.

137
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.740
Now,

138
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.790
if you had another plus sign here and right VB message box,

139
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.330
all RTL reading,

140
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.810
which is the one for making you write in Arabic or Hebrew.

141
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.160
If you run that,

142
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.760
you can see here that the information Sinai's actually moved to the right instead of being

143
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.800
on the left.

144
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.580
So it's kind of preparing you to write in Arabic or Hebrew this way.

145
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.040
Okay,

146
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.620
so now if you put another comma,

147
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.690
you're gonna be in the title argument and you can actually enter the titles of,

148
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.390
for example,

149
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.720
chocolate here and you can see her that because we've got VB message box,

150
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.060
right?

151
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.030
The title is going to be affected by that as well.

152
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.760
So also,

153
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.180
the title is gonna be a line to the right.

154
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.390
So this is how the message box arguments work.

155
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.860
And on the next video,

156
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.510
we're going to see how to capture the user's input as well.
