00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hey,

2
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.540
guys,

3
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.220
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.180
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.130
we're going to speak about objects in Excel V B A.

6
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.540
So vb A or the visual basic.

7
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.530
For applications,

8
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.560
language is an object oriented language,

9
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.160
so V B A is full of objects.

10
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.490
It revolves around objects,

11
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.040
actually,

12
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.830
and all these objects have properties and properties are like characteristics and methods

13
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.240
which are like behaviors or actions or verbs that the object conduce.

14
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.790
So,

15
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.420
for example,

16
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.260
when you describe someone as being told,

17
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.650
okay,

18
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.020
someone's heights is a property.

19
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.650
If you think about that person as an object,

20
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.370
then his height is a property.

21
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.890
And also when you say that someone is walking or someone is running,

22
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.800
running or walking is a method.

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.270
If you think about someone as an object,

24
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.390
then walking or running is a method.

25
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.230
And if you think about stuff around us as objects,

26
00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.720
so,

27
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.650
for example,

28
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.820
a car is an object,

29
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.130
and it has some properties and methods,

30
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.380
so part of the properties of the car is its color.

31
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.630
So color is a property because it's something that you can describe.

32
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.680
The car with the cars type,

33
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.380
for example,

34
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.740
is well,

35
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.500
is it in SUVs that event,

36
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.350
the car's brand.

37
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.310
So is the more CDs to BMW Toyota.

38
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.080
All these are properties,

39
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.500
and the car has some methods as well.

40
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.890
So moving when the car moves from one place to another,

41
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.650
that is a method.

42
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.010
So any object,

43
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.930
if you think about it,

44
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630
has properties and methods.

45
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.300
And this is how XlV be a works.

46
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.990
If you think about your mobile phone as well.

47
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.510
Your mobile phone has some properties such as its color,

48
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.480
such as its screen size and its brand as well is in an iPhone.

49
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.590
Is is Samson.

50
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.960
All these are properties for the mobile phone,

51
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.550
and it has some methods as well.

52
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.730
Part of the methods are the actions that the mobile phone can do.

53
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.850
It can call.

54
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.100
It,

55
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.870
can text.

56
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.290
It can access the Internet.

57
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.440
All these are methods.

58
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.220
If you think about yourself as well as an object,

59
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.490
you have some properties and methods.

60
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.110
So part of the properties are your heights,

61
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.190
your eye color,

62
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.390
your skin color.

63
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.390
All these are properties.

64
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.250
Some of the methods that you can do you can eat.

65
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.070
You can sleep,

66
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.900
you can walk,

67
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.690
he can run.

68
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.650
All these are methods.

69
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.380
If you think about yourself as an object.

70
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.120
Now V.

71
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.290
B.

72
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.980
A has a lot of objects,

73
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.840
and as an example of the objects that you will encounter in XlV B A.

74
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.850
There is the range object,

75
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.610
so the range object is basically the cells.

76
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.200
In an Excel spreadsheet.

77
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.170
A range object can be a single cell or multiple cells,

78
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.810
so the range object has some properties,

79
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.360
like the value of the cell.

80
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.980
For example,

81
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.980
the value is a property,

82
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.860
and it has some methods,

83
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.250
such as the select method,

84
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.370
which is the method that used to select the cell.

85
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.890
Okay,

86
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.160
this is a method.

87
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.700
This is an action that you're going to do to the cell.

88
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.130
So this is why it's a method.

89
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.200
There's also the worksheet object.

90
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.950
The worksheet is an object,

91
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.450
so it has some properties,

92
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.890
such as its name.

93
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.410
So the name is a property,

94
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.750
the name of the worksheet.

95
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.240
And there are also methods like the select method to select the worksheet.

96
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.050
This is an action that you're going to do,

97
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.560
so this is a method.

98
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.060
There's also the copy method work she dot copy method for copying the worksheet.

99
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.700
The worksheet dot move as well.

100
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.240
The method for moving a worksheet as well.

101
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.590
This is a method or inaction that you're going to do to the worksheet.

102
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.490
There's also they sell workbook object so your workbook as well is an object.

103
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.680
It has some properties,

104
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.410
such as its name as well,

105
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.610
and it has some methods,

106
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.290
such as opening the workbook,

107
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.470
so workbook that open is a method.

108
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.750
Closing the workbook dot close is a method as well,

109
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.550
and we will learn about that in more detail as we progress through the course.

110
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.650
There's also the Excel application object,

111
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.180
so the Excel as an application is also an object that has some properties and methods.

112
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:28.200
And also you need to understand that objects can contain other objects and they're called

113
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200
container objects.

114
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.420
So,

115
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.160
for example,

116
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.780
the Excel application object contains the Excel workbook object,

117
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.040
right,

118
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.870
because the Workbook Excel workbook is part of the Excel application on Also,

119
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.940
the Excel worksheet is part of the Excel workbook object as well,

120
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.950
because the worksheet is gonna be insight.

121
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.010
A workbook and also the range object is contained inside the worksheets object as well.

122
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.390
Okay,

123
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.770
so you need to understand the idea that objects can contain other objects also objects can

124
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.060
be part of a collection.

125
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.460
So we've got the idea off collections in xlv being collections are like different families

126
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.460
.

127
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.180
So we get the work sheets collection,

128
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.770
for example.

129
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.680
So this is like the worksheets family.

130
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.220
Okay,

131
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.880
The family of worksheets and all objects that are part of a collection will have the same

132
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.450
properties and methods.

133
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.910
Okay,

134
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.960
so when we say the worksheets collection,

135
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:38.080
that means that every worksheet belongs to this particular collection and that all the work

136
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.210
sheets will have the same properties and methods.

137
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.890
We've also got the work books collection.

138
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:51.540
So this is another family in XlV be a the workbooks family and the workbooks family

139
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.020
contains all the workbooks in XlV B A and all the workbooks.

140
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.300
Because they belong to this family that is called the collection have the same properties

141
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.230
and methods so or workbooks.

142
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.230
And exactly they will have the same properties and methods.

143
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:17.030
There's also this sells collection object so oversells will belong to the cells collection

144
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.470
object And why are collections useful in excel?

145
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.740
The V A While collections enable you to run code for all objects belonging to the same

146
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.570
collection so you can loop through a collection of objects to perform an action toe Every

147
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.500
member of the collection and we will learn about loops later on in the course.

148
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.980
So basically you can go through each member of a collection and performance action to that

149
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.980
.

150
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.920
Members weaken,

151
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.150
for example,

152
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:53.320
go through each cell in the cells collection and type a certain value to all the cells in

153
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.440
the cells collection.

154
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.090
For example,

155
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.390
perform any other action.

156
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.010
Okay,

157
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:04.100
so collections are very useful because the enable us to run code for all objects belonging

158
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.740
to the same collection.

159
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.340
And we will see that as well as we progress into the course.

160
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.840
Okay,

161
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.050
guys.

162
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.650
So that's it for objects in excel.

163
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.650
VB A Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see you on the next one.
