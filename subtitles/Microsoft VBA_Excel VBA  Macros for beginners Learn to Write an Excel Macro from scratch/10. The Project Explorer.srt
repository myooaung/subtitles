00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,220
Hey,

2
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,500
guys,

3
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,070
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,910
So in this video,

5
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:07,770
we're going to speak about the Project Explorer and the Project Explorer is this window

6
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,370
here that is open on the left and in Excel.

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,970
Actually,

8
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,280
each workbook is considered a project on its own.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,540
And at the moment you can see here that I've got only one workbook open here.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,380
The rest of the workbooks.

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,150
The rest of these projects are actually system workbooks.

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,500
There are related to the Silver tool and excel in other tools as well.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,420
It's actually the only workbook that I've got open is the workbook called VB editor intro.

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,910
Now,

15
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,030
if the Project Explorer is not showing on your screen for any reason,

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,530
you can view it by going to the view many here at the top and then clicking on Project

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,250
Explorer.

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,300
And you can also,

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,230
alternatively,

20
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,680
click on control on R on your keyboard.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,010
You can,

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,440
of course,

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,770
close the project,

24
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,950
explore by clicking on this X button here on this close button,

25
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,030
and you can also move it around if you want.

26
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,170
If you click on the title and drag it around,

27
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,060
you can move it around and you conduct it back again.

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:17,360
here by moving in and noticing some sort of off a shadow that will appear there and it will

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,680
be docked back again.

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,070
Now,

31
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,850
Currently,

32
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,630
on my workbook I've got only one sheet,

33
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,550
which is cold cheat one he can see also a modules holder.

34
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,710
Will you have your modules and these air?

35
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,780
Basically the containers of your mac rose off your VB a code.

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,780
And whenever you record a macro and you don't have any modules,

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,900
Excel actually will create a module automatically.

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,750
If you record a macron,

39
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,270
you will also see any user forms that you create.

40
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,010
You will see them here as well on the Project Explorer.

41
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,850
If you have multiple modules as well or multiple folders of modules,

42
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,990
you will see that also on the Project Explorer.

43
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,140
Okay,

44
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,770
so that's a guys for the Project Explorer.

45
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,660
Thank you very much watching this video I'll see on the next one
