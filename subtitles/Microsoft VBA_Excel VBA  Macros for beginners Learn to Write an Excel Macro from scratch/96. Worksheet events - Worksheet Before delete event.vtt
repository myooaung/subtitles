00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Okay,

2
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.570
guys.

3
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.720
So now we're going to speak about the before the elite event.

4
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.630
And as the names just's,

5
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.850
it executes amoebi a code before e sheet is deleted.

6
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.570
So I have created here a sheet called before delete event.

7
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.150
Okay,

8
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.590
I'm just going to right click and go to view code to go to the events for that sheet menace

9
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.860
elect worksheet here,

10
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.530
and then I'm going to select before delete to be my event.

11
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.490
I'm gonna delete this worksheet selection change event,

12
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.750
and we can have a message box Appear.

13
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.610
This is by boy,

14
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.450
for example.

15
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.950
Okay.

16
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.950
And I'm gonna close that if we delete the sheet here.

17
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.950
No,

18
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.470
you can see here that the code has not been executed yet.

19
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.390
When you click on delete.

20
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.830
Okay,

21
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.810
you will see,

22
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.120
actually,

23
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.630
that the message box will appear before that She disappears.

24
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.140
Okay,

25
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.180
So this is why it's called the before delete.

26
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.350
Because the could will be executed before deleting the sheep.

27
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.880
Okay.

28
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.450
So you can see here Message boxes appeared that she'd still exists.

29
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.860
You click.

30
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.520
OK,

31
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.780
She disappears.

32
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.590
I've never used this before.

33
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.060
Um,

34
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.150

35
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.180
Okay,

36
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.480
