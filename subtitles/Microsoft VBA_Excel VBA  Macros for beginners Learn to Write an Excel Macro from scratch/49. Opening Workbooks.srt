00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
Hey,

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:00,890
guys,

3
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,390
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,390
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,030
we're going to discuss the open method for the workbooks collection object.

6
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,090
So we're going to see how to open workbooks using XlV B A.

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,060
So basically,

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,830
to open a workbook in excel VB a use the open method on the workbooks collection objects

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,670
you write workbooks dot open and then if you type of space,

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,220
you're going to see a bunch of parameters.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,120
We're going to speak about the most important ones.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,710
So basically,

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,940
one of the most important ones is the file name,

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,550
and this is actually a mandatory parameter.

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,860
You have to provide that one.

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,010
And in the foul name,

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,200
you basically provide the path and the foul name and extension.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,740
So the same as when we were providing the file name on the save as method,

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,410
for example.

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,190
So basically,

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,450
I'm going to provide the fall path,

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,310
including the name and extension.

23
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:00,930
So we're gonna actually open the test file that we created on the test folder on my desktop

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:00,930
.

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,610
So if you were in this code,

26
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,970
you're actually gonna be able to open the test file on my test folder on my desktop,

27
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,340
So I've been able to open it.

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,010
As you can see her.

29
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,900
The follow the file has been opened.

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,870
So I'm gonna close it on.

31
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,880
I'm gonna go back to my visual basic editor on If I type a comma,

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,350
I can start typing the other parameters.

33
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,140
So here there's a prompter called Update Ling's,

34
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,660
which actually configures how you can update the links.

35
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,800
So actually,

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,840
there are some valid values,

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,240
just three or four valid values for this update links parameter and to know what the

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,670
valiant values are.

39
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,270
Well,

40
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,600
we're just gonna highlight it and press F one on our keyboard.

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,730
And now we're actually on the workbook.

42
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,630
That update links property.

43
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,900
And as you can see here,

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,120
there are actually three voted values for the property.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:02,400
So actually excel update links always and excel plate links never and extra update links

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,220
user setting.

47
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,220
So the 1st 1 updates at the links,

48
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,930
no matter what.

49
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,790
So their links our always updated.

50
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:15,500
And this 2nd 1 actually ensures that the links are never updated.

51
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,250
And the 3rd 1 updates the links according to the user's setting for the specified workbook

52
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,250
.

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,610
And I believe you need to actually know about the update links feature in Excel,

54
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,280
which actually when?

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,310
When you have some links to other workbooks,

56
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,020
you should have that on the file menu.

57
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,690
When you click on file on the upper left corner of Excel,

58
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,440
you're gonna have a section on the lower right.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,760
This says update lings and you can configure how links air updated from there.

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,710
So actually,

61
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,550
this is its corresponding feature in XlV Be a basically.

62
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,990
So it actually accepts one of these three values,

63
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:00,420
and you can actually choose to put one of these three values according to what you want to

64
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:00,800
do.

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,850
So let's go back to our visual basic editor.

66
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,370
OK,

67
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,740
so we're back to the visual basic editor,

68
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,810
and another parameter here that you can use is actually the read only,

69
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,550
and the read only parameter accepts values of either true or false.

70
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,700
So if you put a true the foul that you open will be just street only you won't be able to

71
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,060
it it and save in it.

72
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,280
And if you put a false than it's not gonna be read,

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,870
only you're gonna be able to edit it.

74
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,540
And,

75
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,210
of course,

76
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,340
the default value for it should be fools,

77
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,050
as when you provide a false value or would you don't provide the value at all.

78
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,700
The foul can be edited.

79
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,310
So if we provide a true value for that one here and open our best foul,

80
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,330
so run the macro.

81
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:47,990
Basically,

82
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,490
you can see here that the fall has been open as read only.

83
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,500
And if you try to edit it and then try to save so press control and s is gonna tell you

84
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,220
street only,

85
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,770
and you need to save it to a different location.

86
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,840
So that is how the read only parameter works another parameter,

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,250
which is actually the password parameter.

88
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,980
So the password parameter allows you to put a password that you're gonna open the file with

89
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:11,980
.

90
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,040
So basically,

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,660
if the file has a password this past,

92
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:22,300
or it can just go into the password field for the foul that you're opening says to open the

93
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,010
file without needing to type the pastor because you're typing in the code.

94
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,030
So basically,

95
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,760
for example,

96
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,830
I'm gonna open a file that was cooled password and had a file called VB a course,

97
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,660
for example,

98
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,900
using that coat.

99
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,500
So,

100
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,450
as you can see,

101
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,590
I'm going to try to open the file password that we had created before that had a positive E

102
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,310
b A course.

103
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,100
I'm putting the password here in the code.

104
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,060
And if I run that macro,

105
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,580
the fall will be open and the password will be typed.

106
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:50,830
You know,

107
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,560
while the code is being executed,

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,130
I won't need to input password because I've put it in the coat.

109
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,920
If actually,

110
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,960
I try to open a file that has a password and don't tied the pastor parameters.

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,660
So I don't specify here that I'm gonna be asked for the password as if I'm opening the file

112
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:06,660
.

113
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,860
And it has a pastor's from us where the pastor to If I run that because here that I'm being

114
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,380
asked for the password,

115
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,730
you know,

116
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,140
on I have to type it.

117
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,890
In this case,

118
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,030
there is also the right rez password.

119
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,940
The right rez.

120
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,470
Password parameter here is actually a parameter that allows you to type the password for

121
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,640
the writing restriction.

122
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,160
Okay,

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,950
so I'm gonna type the password for the file that we had created that well schooled right

124
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,960
rez and had a positive right rez.

125
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,040
And this is actually gonna type the password within the code without me needing to type it

126
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,760
So?

127
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,110
So if I run this code,

128
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,200
you consider that the file has been opened on the password has been typed as well.

129
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,420
Well,

130
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,630
the funds being open because I talked the password into the code.

131
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,320
And of course as well.

132
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,570
If you don't specify that parameter,

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,700
then when you open the foul that has a writing restriction password,

134
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,880
you're gonna be oss for the password.

135
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,680
So these are actually the most important parameters according to the scope of the courses

136
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,250
is a beginner.

137
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,800
Of course,

138
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,420
I believe as a beginner,

139
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,560
knowing these parameters is more than enough for you at this stage.

140
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,320
So ah,

141
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,820
thank you guys for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
