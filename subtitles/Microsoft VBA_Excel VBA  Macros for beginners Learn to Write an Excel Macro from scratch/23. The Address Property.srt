1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190
Hey,

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,490
guys,

3
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,140
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,170
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,290
we're going to discuss the range dot address property.

6
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,860
So the range thought address,

7
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,450
property.

8
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,200
What it does is that it outputs the address off a range,

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,160
and it has actually some arguments.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,290
But all these arguments or all these inputs are optional.

11
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:20,810
Okay,

12
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,110
all of them are optional.

13
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,330
So even if you don't enter these inputs,

14
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,950
the range that address property is still gonna work because these inputs will get some

15
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,250
default values case off created and macro here,

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,130
or a PSA procedure called range Underscore address and let's have an example.

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:39,760
So all right,

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,800
range a one dot address.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,270
And actually,

20
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,150
if we just run that it will still work.

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,460
But if you open parentheses,

22
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,750
you will see the arguments or the inputs that you can enter into the range,

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,260
start address property,

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,650
and is because year all the inputs they do have square brackets around them,

25
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,780
and that means that they are optional.

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,600
So any input that you see the house square brackets around,

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,980
it means that it's optionally.

28
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,790
You do not have to provide it,

29
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,580
okay?

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,200
And if you don't provide any of these inputs,

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,450
they will got some default values,

32
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,840
and you can know the default values that each input gets.

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,930
If you search this on the Microsoft Directory Network,

34
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,380
you search for the range dot address property.

35
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,250
Google that,

36
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,100
and you will know it.

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,200
You can actually highlight that and press F one on your keyboard.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,520
And this will take you to the page explaining it on the Microsoft directly network case.

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,730
As you can see here,

40
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,430
this is the range dot address property in Excel.

41
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,280
And you can see here that there is an explanation for each input and what the default value

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,780
would be if you do not input a value for any of these inputs.

43
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,250
Okay,

44
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,110
they will get some default values,

45
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,490
and this is all explained here.

46
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay,

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,730
so back to our range dot address property.

48
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,470
The first input here,

49
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,560
the row absolute.

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,710
This stakes values of either true or false.

51
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,310
Okay.

52
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,270
And if this takes a value of true,

53
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,260
what's gonna happen,

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,440
is that the rope part off the reference for yourself.

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,540
So here the reference for your cell is a one.

56
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,340
The rope part,

57
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,590
which is the one is gonna be absolute.

58
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,980
And that means that is gonna have a dollar sign before it.

59
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,290
You know,

60
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,530
about absolute and relative references in Excel.

61
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,370
This is actually one of the basics in excel.

62
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,270
So if you could give this a value of true the rope part of your self reference will have a

63
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,690
dollar sign before it.

64
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,400
And before the column,

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,520
Absolute as well.

66
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,050
If you give this a value of true,

67
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,010
the column part will have a dollar sign before it as well.

68
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,550
And actually you can either put a value of true or you can also put a one okay,

69
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,220
And you couldn't put a false or you can put a zero.

70
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,520
Okay,

71
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,090
so one is equivalent to true,

72
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,620
and zero is equivalent to false as well.

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,570
Says say,

74
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:11,970
I'm gonna put the rule absolute to be true or one and the condom absolute to be true or one

75
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,510
as well.

76
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,270
And if you put this inside a message boxes but this inside a message box and see what we

77
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,620
get,

78
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,940
we're gonna actually get dollar sign,

79
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,050
a dollar sign one.

80
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,360
So the whole reference for the cell is gonna be absolute.

81
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,370
So if you run that you can see here We got dollars on a dollar sign one day.

82
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,330
And if we,

83
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,990
for example,

84
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,490
make the calm absolute a false or a zero,

85
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,080
that means that a column part which is the A in the cell reference,

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,410
a one is not gonna have a dollar sign before it was gonna be a dollar sign.

87
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,660
One if you run that can see that.

88
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,290
Okay,

89
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:47,700
of course,

90
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,800
if we put that as a zero is going to be just a one without any dollar sites,

91
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,070
OK,

92
00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:00,420
so you got the idea is just it controls how the address is displayed and whether the rope

93
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,580
part or the column part our absolute or relative.

94
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,000
So this is what the role absolute and the column Absolute inputs control.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
Okay,

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,060
so if you put another comma and we go to our third import or third argument because here

97
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,430
the third impetus called reference style as Excel Reference stall and it takes.

98
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,800
Actually,

99
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,590
two values either excel a one or excel are one C one on these air.

100
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,400
Basically the two ways that you can refer to the Excel cells in excel.

101
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,990
Okay,

102
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,410
so the excel a one is basically the very common way of referring to cells,

103
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,910
which is a one a two c one c two d one d do d to ah,

104
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:52,880
the excel are one C one style is on obsolete style of referring to cells.

105
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,770
It's not used by 99% of the Excel users and just don't want it,

106
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,580
you know,

107
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,090
dive deep into that sorority.

108
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't wanna confuse people,

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,180
so I'm not gonna dive deep into that.

110
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,070
You just stick to the Excel a one style OK,

111
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,770
which is the common style that everybody uses.

112
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,680
And this is actually the default value for this inputs.

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,450
If you don't give this input any value,

114
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,930
it will default to excel a one which is actually what's required because this is the style

115
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,720
used by 99% of the Excel users.

116
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,480
Okay,

117
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,590
so now if we had another comma here,

118
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,140
we will go to the external input for the range dot address property,

119
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,830
and this impotent takes values of either true or false.

120
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,920
And if it takes a value of true than what's gonna happen is that it's going to display the

121
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,350
full address for the range,

122
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,310
including the workbook reference and the worksheet reference as well.

123
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,080
Okay,

124
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,120
so that's put that as a true or one Okay,

125
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,720
so true.

126
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,500
And one are the same basically.

127
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,330
And if you close the brackets and we will close the brackets for the message box as well

128
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:11,000
and we run that you will see here that we get actually the full address for the cell.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,560
A one.

130
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,350
Okay.

131
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,190
So you can see here it says range,

132
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,840
object of excels and which is the name of my workbook.

133
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,200
And then sheet one,

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,640
which is the name of the sheet.

135
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,830
Okay.

136
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,940
And then the reference for the Sella's.

137
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,320
Well,

138
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,690
okay,

139
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,810
so this is the full reference,

140
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,520
including the workbook and the worksheet references,

141
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,910
and probably won't use that.

142
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,350
Ah lot.

143
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,550
But they just wanted you to know what it does.

144
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,920
OK?

145
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,530
And of course,

146
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,800
if you put a fool's for it,

147
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,850
if you put a zero,

148
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,720
then he well,

149
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,440
just display the cell reference.

150
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,110
And this is actually the default value.

151
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,470
So if you don't put anything on that external input than it will just get the value of

152
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,780
false OK,

153
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,780
so moving on to the relative to import this relative to imp,

154
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,180
it actually is only used when you put the reference style input to be R one C one which is

155
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:09,950
actually the obsolete way of referring to excel cells that 99% of the Excel users do not

156
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,250
use.

157
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,750
So I'm not gonna go into that,

158
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,570
okay?

159
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,470
Because you probably won't use it a toll,

160
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,500
so I won't go into that.

161
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,070
Okay,

162
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,750
so the two inputs that you're gonna use most frequently are actually the role absolute.

163
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,880
And the column absolute.

164
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,420
And we've explained them.

165
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,180
And actually,

166
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,150
if you don't put any values in them,

167
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,350
they will default,

168
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,850
too.

169
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,380
True.

170
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,920
That means that both of them will be absolute.

171
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,000
So the row and the calm references will both be absolute.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
So if you just write range a $1 address,

173
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,060
Even if you don't write the brackets,

174
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,770
this will default to true.

175
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,120
Okay,

176
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,550
So if I don't write the brackets,

177
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,240
even for the range that outers property and just want to write that inside a message box,

178
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,650
you can see here that we get both the row and the column to be absolute.

179
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,590
Okay,

180
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,380
so I want to show you something else as well.

181
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,120
If you write a one to C six for example dot address.

182
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,830
Okay.

183
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,630
And if you run that actually,

184
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,710
the role absolute and the common absolute will default to.

185
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,180
True.

186
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,620
That means you've got a one to C six old absolute,

187
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,860
the row and the column references,

188
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,350
OK?

189
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,650
And of course,

190
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,980
if you just put both as fools the role absolute in the column.

191
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,900
Absolute.

192
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,290
Okay.

193
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,740
And you run that again Here,

194
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:35,250
you'll see here that you get them as relative the e one to C six old.

195
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,070
The whole reference is relative.

196
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,400
OK,

197
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,070
so just to wrap up what the range dot address property does is that it outputs the address

198
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,890
for the range that you use it on.

199
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,350
And,

200
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:46,710
of course,

201
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,840
you need to know the difference between absolute and breath of references in Excel.

202
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,590
To be able to understand that range dot address property fully.

203
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,140
And if you don't know the difference between the absolute and relative references in exiled

204
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,700
recommended,

205
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,350
watch a video on it or read the article or something,

206
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,850
it should be part of the basics of Excel.

207
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,180
And if you're taking a V b A course and he should be an intermediate to advanced user,

208
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,890
but you could watch a video on absolute versus relative references on YouTube or something

209
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,710
to be able to understand that fully.

210
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,460
OK,

211
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,850
so thanks guys watching this video and I'll see you on the next one
