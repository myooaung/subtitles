00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320
Hey,

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,630
guys,

3
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,500
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,090
So in this video,

5
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,660
we're going to speak about variables.

6
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,950
So what is a variable?

7
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:15,690
A variable is basically something that gets its value changed over and over again in your

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,580
macro or in your procedure.

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,350
Okay,

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,610
so at some point in your procedure,

11
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,010
its value could be a one.

12
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:22,170
So,

13
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,950
for example,

14
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,520
let's say we would have a variable named X the value of X at the beginning of the procedure

15
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,600
or the macro could be one.

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,590
And then during running the macro,

17
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,450
it can become a two and then a three and then a five and then a seven.

18
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,550
You know,

19
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,900
its value can change over and over again.

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,050
While you are running your macro,

21
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:51,990
you can think about it as basically a bucket that you put a value insight,

22
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,430
okay.

23
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,070
And this value can change over and over again while running your macro.

24
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,670
So why would that be useful or beneficial?

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,990
Like,

26
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,670
why would I use variables?

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,310
I'm gonna show you a simple problem,

28
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,150
and we will use variables to solve that problem.

29
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,190
And you will basically discover how useful variables are.

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,340
So basically this say we've got a rectangle.

31
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,110
Okay,

32
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,810
We can recall from studying basic math in school that the area over rectangle is equal to

33
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,470
length.

34
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:35,450
The length of their Tanger multiplied by the width okay on the perimeter is equal to two

35
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,570
multiplied by the length plus the width,

36
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,180
so it add the length past with and then multiply that by two to get the perimeter off a

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,150
rectangle.

38
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:52,250
So let's say I want to display the area on my rectangle here in Selby to and I want to

39
00:01:52,250 --> 00:02:00,130
display the perimeter on my rectangle in cell C two under this header here names perimeter

40
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,670
in Cell C one.

41
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:10,150
So let's say that the length off my rectangle is equal to two on the wits is equal to three

42
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,150
.

43
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,130
Okay,

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,190
so I can say range.

45
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,690
Be too.

46
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:21,140
So I want to display the area in Selby to it and say Range V two is equal to the length,

47
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,460
which is two and then the with,

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,920
which is three.

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:34,260
And I can also say to display my perimeter that the range C two is equal to the length is

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,870
two and the with his three.

51
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,190
So that's two by two plus three cases.

52
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,300
It's two multiplied by two plus three Okay,

53
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,800
so the area is going to be a six,

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,270
and then the perimeter is gonna be a 10.

55
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,850
So if you run this macro,

56
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,280
you can see here that the area has been displayed in Selby to its six,

57
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,610
and the perimeter is 10.

58
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:06,450
So let's say I want to calculate the area on the perimeter of a different rectangle.

59
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,540
But this time the length is four and the with IHS five.

60
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,920
So what I need to do is to change here the values of the length on the wit.

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,500
Okay,

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,220
so the length is four.

63
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,420
And with this five,

64
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,040
So I'm changing the values here of the length and the width.

65
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,620
And if I run this macro,

66
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:26,970
Okay,

67
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,680
you can see here the area has become 20 and the perimeter has become 18.

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,350
Okay,

69
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,550
so say I want to calculate the area of 1/3 rectangle.

70
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,800
The different rectangle.

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,150
The length is three,

72
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,110
and the width is four.

73
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:48,280
I will need to change the values here again and change the lens to be a three and the wits

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,350
to be a four.

75
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,280
And then I would run my macro and get my results.

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,200
So you see,

77
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,850
every time I need to calculate the area of a different rectangle.

78
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,010
I will need to change the values here in several locations.

79
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,000
So I need to change it in the formula for calculating the area on.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,170
I will need to change it also in the equation for calculating the perimeter.

81
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,730
Okay,

82
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,430
so this is not very efficient,

83
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,250
right?

84
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,890
Because I need to change it several times.

85
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,790
So how about I can use a way to change it just one time?

86
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,520
Okay.

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,970
So I can create a variable called El for length on I can put it equal to two.

88
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,850
For example.

89
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,610
Let's say want to calculate the area and the perimeter for a rectangle that has a length of

90
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,960
two and the width of four.

91
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,720
So I can put this equal to two and with equals to four and can also change it in the

92
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,070
equation here so I can make it l by W and then also here to multiple by l plus w.

93
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,400
You can see here that now the equations are referencing the variables,

94
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,570
the length and the width.

95
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,780
So whenever I need to change the variables,

96
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,770
I will need to change them in on Lee.

97
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,070
One location or whenever I need to calculate the area of a different rectangle,

98
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,050
I will need to insert the length and the width in only one location.

99
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,840
So I will need to do it here once Onley length equals two with e equals four.

100
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,540
If I run this macro,

101
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,830
you can see here that the area is eight and the perimeter is 12.

102
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,530
Okay,

103
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,720
so now we need to change.

104
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,920
The only ones to say length is five with the six.

105
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,480
Now,

106
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,630
if around this macro I can get the area and the perimeter here on the left sequence here I

107
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,960
you'll need to only change it once.

108
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,320
I don't have to change it several times.

109
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,900
So imagine that you've got lots off sentences are lots of lines of code referencing your

110
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,740
variables.

111
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:52,330
You can just make only one change on this change will be reflected in all the lines of code

112
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,890
are on the sentences referencing these variables.

113
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,220
That's a very simple example.

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,050
You will see the power of variables.

115
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,830
They're much more powerful than that.

116
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,090
But this is basically,

117
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,400
like a very simple use off variables why they would be useful.

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,110
This guy's was just ah,

119
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,680
simple introduction to variables and we will go much deeper in the upcoming videos.

120
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,700
Thank you very much for watching this video on.

121
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,910
