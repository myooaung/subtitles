Hey,

2
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.420
guys,

3
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.020
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.980
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.250
we're going to discuss the workbook before print event and the workbook before print event

6
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.250
.

7
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.590
As the name suggests,

8
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.470
it runs any code written in that event before printing happens.

9
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.670
So to get to that event,

10
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.780
you need to open your VB editor and then you're gonna double click on this workbook here,

11
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.680
and then you're gonna click on workbook from this menu.

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.320
Andi,

13
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.570
you're gonna select before print here from this menu,

14
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.380
just going to lead the workbook open event because we don't need it.

15
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.580
So it actually works similarly to the workbook before close event and you can see her.

16
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.600
There is a parameter called cancel,

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.040
and the this cancel parameter is bullion,

18
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.210
so it takes values of true or false is by default falls.

19
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.870
However,

20
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.300
if you put it equal to true than printing will not be allowed.

21
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.550
If someone tries to print your ah,

22
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.570
Excel workbook,

23
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.190
they're not going to be allowed to print it.

24
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.130
So I'm gonna put council equals true.

25
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.020
Then maybe a message box printing is not allowed.

26
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.790
So now I'm going to try to print.

27
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.790
So I'm gonna go to file and then print on them going to click here on the print but in here

28
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.660
and says printing is not allowed and it's not allowed me to print.

29
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.310
You can also do something cool with that,

30
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.950
which is that you can be selective of who can print your workbook.

31
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.260
So there is actually a function in Excel,

32
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.550
Vehbi,

33
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.710
eh?

34
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.930
That's called Environment that can determine what the user name off the person who's using

35
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.950
the computer is.

36
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.780
And you can know what the user name of yourself is.

37
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.310
If you're logged on windows with your user taken right here in the immediate window,

38
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.990
for example,

39
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.990
environ after the question mark.

40
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.490
Okay,

41
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.730
sir.

42
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.990
Asking for a certain value.

43
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.890
And then inside that inside environment you're going to write user name?

44
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.300
Sure.

45
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.090
Now asking about the current user name that is using the computer.

46
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.600
Okay,

47
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.090
so I got the user name,

48
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.520
which is myself to get actually right here.

49
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.540
If environment user name is not equal to yours,

50
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.350
then cancel equals true else.

51
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.520
Cancel equals false.

52
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.310
Okay,

53
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.400
and if so,

54
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.910
now is somebody else other than myself tries to print the workbook,

55
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.780
it's not gonna enable him or her to print,

56
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.560
but if it is myself than I'm going to be able to print the workbook.

57
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.740
So that's a bit of ah,

58
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.600
Security if you 12 Okay,

59
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.400
so let's say for the workbook before print event.

60
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.150
Thank you very much,

61
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.370
guys,

62
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.050
for watching this video and I'll see you on the next one.
