00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.210
Okay,

2
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.430
guys.

3
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.540
So now we're going to speak about the worksheet deactivate event.

4
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:03.890
Okay,

5
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.360
so the works you deactivate event gets triggered whenever you just deactivate a worksheet.

6
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.090
So I've created a worksheet here called the Activate Event,

7
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.990
and we're actually gonna write some code that's gonna be triggered whenever this worksheet

8
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.990
is deactivated.

9
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.310
Okay,

10
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.480
So I'm gonna go to a developer,

11
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.700
Tom,

12
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.650
on the ribbon and click on visual Basic.

13
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.110
I can also hit Colton F 11 on my keyboard.

14
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.640
Gonna make sure I'm in the deactivate event worksheet here by double clicking it.

15
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.420
And then I'm gonna from this menu,

16
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.490
I'm going to select worksheet and from this menu here for the event I'm gonna select

17
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.070
Deactivate.

18
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.870
Okay,

19
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.670
I'm gonna delete the selection change event because I'm not going to use it,

20
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.450
okay?

21
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.670
And weaken,

22
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.090
write a message box.

23
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.720
That would appear would just say goodbye when ivory just deactivate the worksheet.

24
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.600
Okay.

25
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.840
I'm gonna deactivate the deactivate event worksheet and activate.

26
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.700
Maybe the worksheet activate event as you can see her.

27
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.250
I had a message box says goodbye and actually,

28
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.550
another message boxes well has appeared.

29
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.030
And for the which is for the activation off the worksheet activate eventually.

30
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.850
Okay,

31
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.740
so this is how it works.

32
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.780
Simply you just deactivate the worksheet,

33
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.950
and whatever code you write would be triggered.

34
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.740
Okay,

35
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.950
guys.

36
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.740
So we're gonna have another practical application here for the works to deactivate events

37
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.470
selling this.

38
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.730
Ah,

39
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.910
dashboard as well.

40
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.510
That is a simple dashboard on my dashboard scores.

41
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.300
Whenever I deactivate the dashboard worksheet,

42
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.740
the ribbon gets shown again.

43
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.370
OK,

44
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.730
so this is because I've got a worksheet deactivate event that just calls a macro cold show

45
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.090
ribbon,

46
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.950
which is this one here that shows the ribbon.

47
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.970
Okay,

48
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.040
so I'm gonna include that for you as well In the example Workbook.

49
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.600
Ok,

50
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.820
so it's another packed practical application,

51
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.220
something that you can do in the real world with work.

52
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.250
She deactivate event,

53
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.250
and there are many,

54
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.680
many in numerous applications for that.

55
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.400
Okay,

56
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.330
so thank you guys for watching this video.

57
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.370
I'll see on the next one.
