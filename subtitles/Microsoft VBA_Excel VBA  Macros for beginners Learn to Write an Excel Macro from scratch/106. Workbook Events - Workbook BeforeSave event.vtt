00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.220
Hey,

2
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.540
guys,

3
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.170
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.980
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.920
we're going to discuss the workbook before save event.

6
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.820
So the workbook before save event,

7
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.510
and as the name suggests,

8
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.480
it actually gets fired before saving a workbook.

9
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.140
OK?

10
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.850
And that means that it gets fired just after you hit the save button on your keyboard.

11
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.780
After you press control and s and before the actual saving,

12
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.120
this macro gets fired.

13
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.790
Okay,

14
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.440
So to apply that event,

15
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.850
you need to go to the developer tab on the ribbon.

16
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.780
Click on visual.

17
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.430
Basic.

18
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.170
Okay.

19
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.880
And make sure you are in this workbook module here and select workbook from this menu and

20
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.770
then from the menu on the right here,

21
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.010
you're going to select that before save event.

22
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.250
I'm just going to lead the workbook open event because we don't need it.

23
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.350
And as you can see here,

24
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.650
this before safe event has actually two parameters.

25
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.300
There is the save as you I and there is the cancel parameter,

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.630
and they are both bullion.

27
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.840
And that means that the both except two or false values on Lee Now the save as you I

28
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.470
parameter what this controls is that it controls whether you get the save as dialog box

29
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.630
when trying to see the workbook that is not saved already or that is open as a read only

30
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.250
workbook.

31
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.350
So what I'm meaning is when you open a new workbook.

32
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.720
Okay,

33
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.390
this is a new workbook opened and you can see her Excel gives its temporary name of book

34
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.760
one.

35
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.400
When you press control and s on your keyboard,

36
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.190
you get the safe as dialogue.

37
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.760
Boxer This supposedly safe as our dialogue box and you click,

38
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.260
browse,

39
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.720
and then you can start saving.

40
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.090
Okay,

41
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.320
this is a save as doll of box.

42
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.960
Supposedly,

43
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.170
this option should be able to enable or disable that.

44
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.720
Okay.

45
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.530
Disabled.

46
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.590
Getting the the safe as dialog box.

47
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.290
Supposedly,

48
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.260
you should be able to set the value of that two false and then the save as dialog box would

49
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.710
not appear so we can actually try that.

50
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.290
So I'm just gonna go to book one here,

51
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.200
click on this workbook here,

52
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.710
and then click on workbook here and click on before save.

53
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.520
And then if I put the sea vise you I equals falls.

54
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.830
Supposedly that should disable the save as dialog box from appearing.

55
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.140
So if I go to the to book one again here and press control and asks.

56
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.820
Actually,

57
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.100
I'm still getting the save as dialog box.

58
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.570
I'm still getting this even as option I've researched on the Internet and a lot of people

59
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.190
are actually reporting that it's not working,

60
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.690
so we're not going to discuss it any further.

61
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.080
The second parameter here that we're going to explain is the Council Parmenter.

62
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.190
And what this permit,

63
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.700
er does is that if it is put equals two,

64
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.220
true,

65
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.940
then your workbook will not be saved.

66
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.680
So I'm actually gonna write,

67
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.420
cancel equals true here as and this is gonna be my code.

68
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.150
Basically just cancel equals true.

69
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.650
And this goat should be run whenever I try to save my workbook.

70
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.600
So I'm just going to write my name here,

71
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.550
okay?

72
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.510
And this cell,

73
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.690
I'm going to try to save the workbook and actually will not be saved.

74
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.250
Ah,

75
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.100
so if pressed control and eso normally should be saved,

76
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.030
it will not be saved.

77
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.640
Even if I try to close and press savior,

78
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.170
the workbook gets closed.

79
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.760
However,

80
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.850
let's try to open it again.

81
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.140
Okay,

82
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.100
so after opening the workbook again,

83
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.950
my name has not been saved in this cell,

84
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.520
okay?

85
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.640
And have not been able to safe the workbook.

86
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.650
And even when I go to this workbook here,

87
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.190
actually,

88
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.000
even the procedure that I have written,

89
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.080
which is for the before safe event has not been saved.

90
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.300
Nothing has been saved on the workbook.

91
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.700
OK,

92
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.060
so when you set,

93
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.640
cancel equals two.

94
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.180
True,

95
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.700
your workbook is not gonna be safe.

96
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.000
Okay,

97
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.620
so let's have an example here for the before save event.

98
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.190
So,

99
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.610
actually,

100
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.960
let's say that this is where the user should enter his or her name and Selby one,

101
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.020
and they want to make sure that the enter their name and if the name is not entered If the

102
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.100
cell is blank than the workbook is not going to receive,

103
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.170
if they if they try to save it,

104
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.110
then it will not be saved.

105
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.040
And they will have a message box that says Workbook has not been safe.

106
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.180
Please enter your name.

107
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.070
Okay,

108
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.150
So to do that,

109
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.220
we're going to start writing an if statement.

110
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.890
So if this workbooks worksheets sheet,

111
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:45.350
one range B one is equal to blank then and if cancel is equal to true,

112
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.130
So there is no no saving that's going to be done and their message box cannot save.

113
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.790
Please enter your name.

114
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.250
Okay,

115
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.190
so they're gonna have a message box that says cannot save.

116
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.110
Please enter unit.

117
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.470
So now if I try to save the workbook and there is no name entered here,

118
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.350
it's blank.

119
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.450
But try to save,

120
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.140
cannot save.

121
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.090
Please enter your name.

122
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.070
So I press control and s and I got this message box.

123
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.550
However,

124
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.900
if I put my name here,

125
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.650
I tried to see the workbook.

126
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.690
It's going to save,

127
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.540
and I have not been given the message box.

128
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.310
If I close and reopen it,

129
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.980
I should have my name there.

130
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.220
So I'm gonna do that.

131
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.020
I'm gonna close that now,

132
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.010
have reopened it.

133
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.680
And as you can see here,

134
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.640
I've got my name in in Selby once.

135
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.970
I've been able to save the workbook successfully.

136
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.550
Okay,

137
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.600
so this is how the before safe event works.

138
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.670
It actually triggers.

139
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.980
It actually executes any code after you press save or press control s on your keyboard,

140
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.320
okay?

141
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.500
Or or hit file and save or click on this button.

142
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.270
Save here and before the actual saving.

143
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.810
And through that event,

144
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.440
you can actually disable the saving off a workbook.

145
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.720
If you need to buy,

146
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.260
setting cancel equals true.

147
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.910
OK,

148
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.760
thanks,

149
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.980
guys,

150
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.350
for watching this video I'll see on the next.
