00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
Hey,

2
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.580
guys,

3
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.130
Welcome back.

4
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.000
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.090
we're going to discuss the workbook new chart event.

6
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.840
So the workbook,

7
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.000
new chart event,

8
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.900
whatever code you right in there gets triggered whenever you insert a new charts on your

9
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.690
workbook.

10
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.370
OK?

11
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.140
So you can get it by going to the VB editor and double clicking on this workbook on,

12
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.250
then selecting workbook from this menu and selecting new chart from this menu here.

13
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.190
Now,

14
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:35.810
whatever code you enter in here is going to be triggered by inserting in you chart message

15
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.150
box.

16
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.060
For example,

17
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.340
you have inserted in you chart,

18
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.890
Okay?

19
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.000
And now,

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.960
if I try to insert you chart lists,

21
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.050
they have got some sales figures here.

22
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.950
Justin,

23
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.220
insert a new chart here.

24
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.910
One of the recommended charts.

25
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.060
This Clustered column looks fine.

26
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.400
A vase of inserted short and you can see here the message box bumped a clicked.

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.960
Okay.

28
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.560
And then the chart appears.

29
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.260
Okay,

30
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.580
So had gusts triggered whenever you insert a new chart on,

31
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.990
actually,

32
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.840
it works before the chart.

33
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.850
It's inserted on your workbook.

34
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.230
Okay,

35
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.460
so maybe you want to do something more complicated with the new chart than just display a

36
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.320
message box.

37
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.720
So Maybe you want to change the charts Title,

38
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.520
for example,

39
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.900
Have a certain title whenever you insert a new chart.

40
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.620
So you can do that with the workbook.

41
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.350
New charts event.

42
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.600
So in this workbook new chart event,

43
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.970
actually,

44
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.030
there is you parameter here called ch,

45
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.370
which is basically an object variable that it's type is a chart.

46
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.770
Okay,

47
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.140
so it has all the methods and properties for a chart object in Excel,

48
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.120
so we could write ch ok dot And then we will have all the methods and properties for a

49
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.630
chart,

50
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.800
and then we're just gonna change our chart titles are going to write sieged chart title,

51
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.830
and then this produces a chart title object and it has a property cold text case of dot

52
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.730
Taxed equals my chart,

53
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.450
for example.

54
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.100
Okay,

55
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.260
so that whenever I insert a new chart,

56
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.670
I would have it named as my charter would have its title as my my chart.

57
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.660
So let's try that.

58
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.660
So I'm gonna delete here my previous chart and I'm gonna insert a new charge.

59
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.810
I'm gonna highlight my dates.

60
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.050
Ah,

61
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.300
go to insert.

62
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.700
I'm gonna go to recommended charts here and select this chart here again.

63
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.750
Click Okay.

64
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.110
As you can see here,

65
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.550
the title is now my charts.

66
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.630
Whenever you insert a new chart,

67
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.790
its title is gonna be my chart.

68
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.750
You could also use the workbook new chart,

69
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.010
object to maybe have Cem default colors for your charts,

70
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.200
or maybe have a set of default colors for your charts so that whenever you insert a chart,

71
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.830
it would be inserted with certain colors,

72
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.080
maybe the colors of your brand,

73
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.950
for example.

74
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.640
But actually,

75
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.650
there's another way the I prefer to use rather than vb a code.

76
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.690
But I'll show you how to do it with VB a code,

77
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.300
and then I'll show you the other ways.

78
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.510
So,

79
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.040
basically,

80
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.310
to do that with VB,

81
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.850
a code actually is very hard to memorize the methods and properties for charts and stuff

82
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.760
because there are lots of details in them.

83
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.040
So,

84
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.590
actually,

85
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.290
as one of the methods to learn about a certain object is to actually record a macron with

86
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.250
discussed at the beginning of the course.

87
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.060
And we said that as one of the methods to learn V B.

88
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.520
A is to actually record macros and examine the code.

89
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.610
So this is when this comes handy,

90
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.050
so I can actually select this chart here.

91
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.780
And let's say I wanna change its colors.

92
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.300
Okay,

93
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.640
so maybe here on this style,

94
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.210
I'll go to Colors.

95
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.430
Okay.

96
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.080
On this chart styles year,

97
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.990
I'll go to color and maybe give it some cars.

98
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.510
You know,

99
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.570
just check.

100
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.770
Maybe I want this template here color three.

101
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.300
So I won't every chart to have this set of colors.

102
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.670
Okay,

103
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.880
so what I'm gonna do here,

104
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.590
I'm gonna put everything back to what it was.

105
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.970
I'm gonna do that using the macro recorder.

106
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.830
Okay,

107
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.830
so I'm gonna record a macro.

108
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.130
I'm gonna go to the developer tab on the ribbon here,

109
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.970
click on record,

110
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.650
Macro.

111
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.180
And maybe I'll call it Chart Macro something.

112
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.620
They'll call it chart Macro Click.

113
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.180
OK,

114
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.040
And then I select my chart and I'll start editing its color case will go to that color here

115
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.040
,

116
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.900
so have changed the color of the chart and now will stop recording.

117
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.900
OK,

118
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.310
and now let's examine the code that I've recorded Case I'll open the macro here.

119
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.840
I'll go to Makro Zero and click on edit to check the code that I've recorded.

120
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.380
As you can see here on the active sheets,

121
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.970
I'm selecting,

122
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.850
asserting charge.

123
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.880
I'm activating.

124
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.090
I don't need that.

125
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.410
I actually needs this one here.

126
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.980
The chart color property to be said to be equal to 12.

127
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.020
This is the part I actually need.

128
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:04.260
So just copy that and I'll go to my event and then I'll right here ch dot Short color

129
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.730
equals 12.

130
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.100
Actually,

131
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.680
I just duplicated that.

132
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.160
Okay,

133
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.850
so ch short color equals 12.

134
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.360
And now I'll just delete my chart here and try inserting and you chart and let's see what

135
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.250
happens.

136
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.860
So just sign like my data again.

137
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.800
Go to recommend the charts,

138
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.280
select its short here.

139
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.560
Look.

140
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.110
OK,

141
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.410
As you can see here,

142
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.080
the chart has been inserted with the color that we specified on the event and that we have

143
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.060
obtained through recording.

144
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.300
Okay,

145
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.720
so this is when recording is useful.

146
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.970
Really?

147
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.950
Because there are Sometimes there's some objects that you don't know everything about.

148
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.660
And,

149
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.930
ah,

150
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.560
it's actually easier to record than even to research Google.

151
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.850
Or maybe you can record and get the name of the certain method or property for that object

152
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.730
that you're searching for,

153
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.040
or that you want to modify or play with.

154
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.230
And then you can take it on Google.

155
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.660
You can search it on Google,

156
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.550
understand everything about it and then,

157
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.070
you know,

158
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.430
go back to excel on,

159
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.730
start playing with it.

160
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.120
Okay,

161
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.670
so this is when recording is useful.

162
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.150
Okay,

163
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.940
So I mentioned before that there's another way actually to do this.

164
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.780
That is easier.

165
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.810
Or my opinion it's easier.

166
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.190
Okay,

167
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.060
So I'm just going to leave my charts here,

168
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.820
and I'm going to go to the V B A code.

169
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.030
I'm gonna delete the code in the event so that he wouldn't be executed.

170
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.370
And actually,

171
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.250
there's a nun vb a method which I believe is easier.

172
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.750
Okay,

173
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.930
So I'm going to highlight my data again here and insert the new chart,

174
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.830
and then what I'm gonna do.

175
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.140
Okay,

176
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.420
so I've inserted my chart.

177
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.880
Maybe I don't like this color.

178
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.880
I want another color,

179
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.350
so I'll choose that color.

180
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.800
I'll choose that one here,

181
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.690
and then I can save this chart as a template.

182
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.900
Okay.

183
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.230
So you can right click on it and click conceive this template and save a template.

184
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.190
I'll call it Chart one,

185
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.820
for example.

186
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.900
This is a previous template.

187
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.050
I say they don't need.

188
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.050
I'll just replace it.

189
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.990
So I clicked Yes,

190
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.830
to replace it.

191
00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.590
So now I have a template that I can use so to creating you chart using the template that

192
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.970
you have created I'll just show you how to do it all.

193
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.220
Delete this chart here and I'll just highlight my date again.

194
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.240
Go to insert,

195
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.590
go to recommend a chart here and then go toe old charts and then select templates from year

196
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.590
.

197
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.580
And this is the template here of good A template Cold short one.

198
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.790
So click OK,

199
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.210
and then the new chart will be inserted according to my template on,

200
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.980
I believe this is an easier way to do it if you just want to change the colors.

201
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.500
Okay.

202
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.090
Ah,

203
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.370
this is easier than vb A.

204
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:39.910
This is not needed An expert user in excel Somebody who was familiar with the d A you know

205
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:40.520
to do it.

206
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.260
So that's it,

207
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.070
guys for the workbook.

208
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.450
