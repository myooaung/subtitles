00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
Hagos,

2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.220
welcome back.

3
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.100
So in this video,

4
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.860
we're going to speak about the workbook.

5
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.130
Activate event.

6
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.740
So the workbook activate event works whenever you activate your workbook.

7
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.540
However,

8
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.190
it does not work when you activate your workbook coming from another application other than

9
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.960
excel.

10
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.710
But it actually works when you activate your workbook coming from another workbook in Excel

11
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.710
.

12
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.360
Okay,

13
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.860
so see that inaction?

14
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.320
So I'm gonna go to the developer tab on the ribbon click on visual Basic.

15
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.170
And I'm gonna double quick here on this workbook,

16
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.190
open the module for workbook events,

17
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.230
and then I'm gonna select workbook from this menu.

18
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.250
I'm going to select the activate event.

19
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.100
So now I have selected the activate event,

20
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.740
and I'm just going to write a simple message box here.

21
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.400
Message box.

22
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.220
Maybe when you select it back,

23
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.910
he would say,

24
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.850
Welcome back.

25
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.360
Okay,

26
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.020
A simple message box.

27
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.300
Now I'm just gonna close here the v b A editor,

28
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.450
and now I'm gonna switch to Microsoft Word.

29
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.850
So I'm now I'm on Microsoft Word.

30
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.310
If I switch back to excel,

31
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.630
you see,

32
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.680
nothing happens,

33
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.020
Okay.

34
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.650
However,

35
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.450
if I open a new workbook and I switched to my workbook,

36
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.520
the event gets fired or whatever code you've written there gets executed.

37
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.100
Okay,

38
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
so this is how the workbook activate event works.

39
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.870
Remember,

40
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.070
it does not work when you activate the workbook coming from another application.

41
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.750
It works when you activate the workbook coming from another workbook in Excel.

42
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.570
Okay,

43
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.830
so you can pretty much make any code run whenever you activate your workbook.

44
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.510
OK?

45
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.220
So ah,

46
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.540
that's it for the workbook.

47
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.600
Activate event is very simple.

48
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.480
I don't use it a lot,

49
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.790
but probably you could have other uses.

50
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.120
Your story could be different.

51
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.810
Okay,

52
00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.100
So feel free to open a discussion on what you might use it in or how you use there are what

53
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.070
it was useful for in your case is Okay,

54
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.080
so thanks very much for watching this video.

55
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.280
I'll see on the next one.
