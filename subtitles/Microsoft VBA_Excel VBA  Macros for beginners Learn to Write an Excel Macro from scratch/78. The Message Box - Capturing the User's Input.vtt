00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.240
Hey,

2
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.520
guys,

3
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.160
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.130
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.400
we're going to learn how to capture the user's input on a message box.

6
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.700
So we're going to learn how to capture the answer of a user.

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.130
If the user clicks on a certain button on the message box,

8
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.540
then I need to take some actions based on that,

9
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.860
so we'll learn how to do that.

10
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.220
So basically here the message box buttons,

11
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.020
each one of them has the value.

12
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.170
So the VB okay,

13
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.240
the okay button has a certain value.

14
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.030
The cancel has another value to abort.

15
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.340
His three try is for and so on and so forth.

16
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.090
So basically,

17
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.600
the idea is that we will assign these values to a variable,

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.010
and then we will put an if statement testing what the value is.

19
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.750
And if the value,

20
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.380
for example,

21
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.960
is one or VB OK,

22
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.480
then we will do this in this and that if the values to then we will do this in this and

23
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.080
that and so on and so forth.

24
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.580
So let's have an example.

25
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.400
Okay,

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.640
guys,

27
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.700
So I've created a simple message box.

28
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.140
The asks the user a very simple question.

29
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.620
Do you love chocolate and it will have yes and no buttons.

30
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.960
And it's gonna be a VB question and title of chocolate.

31
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.020
So if you run that,

32
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.580
these air will have this question and he can answer with either yes or no.

33
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.330
So if you answers either yes or known at the moment,

34
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.440
nothing will happen.

35
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.170
So to make something happen,

36
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.810
we need to actually assign the answer of the message box to a variable and for the data

37
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.990
type of the variable will have several options are creator,

38
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
so I'll create a variable named answer.

39
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.010
And the data type for this is the one I prefer is VB message box result.

40
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.840
And the message box result is basically an enumeration,

41
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.970
and this is a fancy word,

42
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.750
however Onley means is that just a list of values having Constance assigned to them?

43
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.940
So now we need to assign the message box to the variable answer,

44
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.900
and you can see when a red equals.

45
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.550
I get a list of the different buttons that the user can click.

46
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.000
But we won't use this list right now,

47
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.770
and if I just click away,

48
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.990
I will get an error.

49
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.980
As you can see here,

50
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.070
the reason for that is that if you read the message box on the right hand side of an

51
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.090
assignment operator like the equal sign,

52
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.070
you need to put the arguments between brackets.

53
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.510
Okay,

54
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.250
so this is something in the V b A syntax.

55
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.560
So now we've assigned the message box to the answer variable.

56
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.220
So now whatever answer the user gives us will be stored in the variable cold answer.

57
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.700
Okay,

58
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.650
so now we need to put an if statement.

59
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.240
So if answer equals,

60
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.940
for example,

61
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.070
here,

62
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.810
we've got yes and no buttons only.

63
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.410
So if answer equals V B s,

64
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.620
then message box this case just gonna be a simple message box.

65
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.330
Great.

66
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.760
I love chocolate too.

67
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:54.350
And else if answer is equal to vb No than message box.

68
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.420
Why not?

69
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.220
Chocolate is delicious.

70
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.860
And if OK,

71
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.970
so now,

72
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.410
based on the user's answer,

73
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.370
he will get one of these two message boxes.

74
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.480
So if we run this code here,

75
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.820
Do you love chocolate?

76
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.260
If I answer Yes.

77
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.110
Great.

78
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.550
I love chocolate too.

79
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.570
And if I ran again,

80
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.750
Do you love chocolate?

81
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.730
No.

82
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.830
Why not?

83
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.180
Chocolate is delicious.

84
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.390
So based on the user's answer,

85
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.210
you can take any kind of actions if you put an if statement you can put any lines of code

86
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.410
here on the if statements and do whatever you want you could also,

87
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.210
instead of VBS and VB no used their corresponding values.

88
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.800
So instead of VBS,

89
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.950
you could put a six and vb no,

90
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.340
you could put a seven here and you can use their corresponding values and this will work to

91
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:55.070
you could also change the data type to an integer and this will work to with the numbers

92
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.640
and also you could write equals VBS and VB No,

93
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.210
and this works as well.

94
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.290
However,

95
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.970
the advantage of using a VB message box result is that you do get the drop down menu while

96
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.530
you're typing the variable.

97
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.470
So when you write,

98
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.150
answer equals,

99
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.070
you start getting the list and you don't need to worry about remembering the answers.

100
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.360
Okay,

101
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.870
so this is why I'd recommend using the VB message box Result data type in this case.

102
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.080
So thank you guys for watching this video and I'll see on the next one
