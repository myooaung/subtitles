00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.180
Hey,

2
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.450
guys,

3
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.000
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.910
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:08.080
we're going to discuss the go to statement and creating labels using the go to statements

6
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.750
and creating labels enables us to jump from one part of the code or from one point of the

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.300
code to another point and bypass some code.

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.200
So let's see how we can do that.

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.070
Basically,

10
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.640
you right,

11
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.300
go to and then let's say you want jump to a certain point,

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.970
okay?

13
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.880
You're gonna call this point something,

14
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.440
So I'm gonna call it my ending,

15
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.330
for example,

16
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.730
And then you need to actually write the name of the point somewhere with a colon.

17
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.370
So what this is going to do is that whenever we execute our code and it's gonna execute,

18
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.140
this line is actually going to jump from this line to this line here,

19
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.400
and it's going to bypass the code here,

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.970
so it's gonna bypass this part of the code says story,

21
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.240
executing that code step by step here.

22
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.210
So when we execute that line,

23
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.150
you can see there is going to jump actually and execute anything after the my ending label

24
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.680
so we can actually put a message box,

25
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.420
for example,

26
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.440
on the my ending.

27
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.370
So message box we have skipped,

28
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.540
skipped some code.

29
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.550
So if we execute the code step by step again,

30
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.770
you can see her is going to jump and execute any lines of code after the my ending,

31
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.150
which is gonna execute this message box and soap.

32
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.200
Okay,

33
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.380
so this is what it does,

34
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.810
and you can actually do the reverse.

35
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.380
So you can,

36
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.630
like,

37
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.970
jump upwards,

38
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.500
go to my beginning,

39
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.800
for example on.

40
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.230
Then you put a my beginning somewhere here and then with a colon.

41
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.450
It's actually when we execute this code,

42
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.850
we're gonna end up in a closed loop,

43
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.510
okay?

44
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.150
With skips,

45
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.290
um,

46
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.620
code.

47
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.340
Go to my beginning with skip some code,

48
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.660
go to my beginning,

49
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.080
okay?

50
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.720
And we're never gonna reach the end sub statement.

51
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.000
Right?

52
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.140
Because whenever we execute the cold,

53
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.240
you go to my ending,

54
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.700
execute the message box,

55
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.650
and then this statement here makes us go upwards,

56
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.410
goes and started the code again,

57
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.250
and then we execute the code again message box and so on and so forth.

58
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.780
And we're now in a closed loop,

59
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.270
and the macro is never gonna end.

60
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.290
So if we execute this macro,

61
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.810
it's never gonna end basically.

62
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.920
So that's it.

63
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.350
I'm just introducing you to a concept which is creating labels and using the go to

64
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.250
statements because we're going to use it in our examples on the course.

65
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.590
I'm going to use a lot,

66
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.910
and it's gonna be useful,

67
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.520
especially in our handling.

68
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.300
Okay,

69
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.960
so that's it.

70
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.350
Guys who go to statement and creating labels,

71
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.410
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
