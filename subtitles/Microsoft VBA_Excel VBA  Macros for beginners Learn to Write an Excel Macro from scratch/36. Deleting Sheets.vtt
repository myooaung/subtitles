00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
in this video,

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.980
we're going to see how we can delete a sheet using V B A so you could use the worksheet or

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.190
the sheet dot delete method.

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.340
So if you're right worksheets she to delete.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.580
So this is gonna actually delete cheat,

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.870
too.

7
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.190
But if you run that AXITY excel will prompt you whether you would like to continue with

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.710
deleting.

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.230
So if you press the delete button,

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.650
the sheet is gonna be deleted.

11
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.020
Or if you press cancel,

12
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.650
the sheet will not be deleted.

13
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.360
And this is just Aziz.

14
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.840
When you do it in the normal Excel interface,

15
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.500
when you right click and click on delete for a sheet,

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.010
you get this prompt.

17
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.750
Okay,

18
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.120
so I'm going to show you how you can suppress this prompt and not have it appear and have

19
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.080
the sheet deleted straight away so you could write application dot display alerts equals

20
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.750
fulls,

21
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.550
and this will actually suppress any alerts that would appear on the screen.

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.840
Any problems that will be suppressed starting from this line of code and you could follow

23
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.440
that with application display alerts equals true at any point that you would like these

24
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.970
alerts or these problems to be displayed again.

25
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.800
So this line of code will make prompts get displayed again,

26
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.650
as usual.

27
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.880
And you know,

28
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.290
of course,

29
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.130
that the code,

30
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.070
the V B A code gets executed from top to bottom.

31
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.140
So we're going to disable the problems,

32
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.290
delete the sheet with the problems being disabled so we won't have the problems and then

33
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.230
enable them again.

34
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.340
And this is what you normally do.

35
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.790
When you want to disable a feature and normal feature in Excel,

36
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.110
it is disabled temporarily,

37
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.570
and then you enable again.

38
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.190
And this is useful.

39
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.460
One debugging your code and we'll speak about D bucking later on in the course.

40
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.200
But this is useful because this makes you have any prompts or problems with your code

41
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.020
displayed on the screen when you just re enable these alerts again.

42
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.520
So if you run this goat,

43
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.600
you can see her that she,

44
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.810
too,

45
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.900
has been deleted and we haven't had the prompt display.

46
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.400
One more thing I want to show you as well is if we try to delete a sheet that is actually

47
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.350
the lost remaining sheet in a workbook.

48
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.960
So if you try to do that in the normally Excel interface,

49
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.290
if you right Click on this sheet and this sheet one is the lost one that is remaining.

50
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.810
It will prompt you.

51
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.660
This will close the workbook without saving.

52
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.390
Some macro modules will be lost.

53
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.440
You want to move the seductive cheats anyway.

54
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.190
But if I click on yes,

55
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.670
here.

56
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.450
Actually,

57
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.290
it says a workbook must contain at least one visible worksheet.

58
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.780
And to hide delete.

59
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.080
To remove this selected sheets,

60
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.690
you must first insert a new sheet or on hide a sheet that is already hidden.

61
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.970
And if a press OK,

62
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.100
nothing has been done.

63
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.850
And actually a workbook needs to contain at least one sheet or worksheet.

64
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.120
So actually,

65
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.260
you cannot delete a sheet if it is the lost remaining worksheet in the workbook.

66
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.850
OK,

67
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.910
so if you run this code you will get an error.

68
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.190
You cannot delete the sheet that is the lost remaining worksheet or sheet in the workbook.

69
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.840
OK,

70
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.650
so that's it,

71
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.750
Guys for the leading sheets.

72
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.580
Thank you very much watching this video I'll see on the next one
