1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,220
Hey,

2
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,530
guys,

3
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,380
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,450
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,640
we're going to discuss this lucked case statement.

6
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,650
So the select a statement in Excel Vivier can perform a similar task to the if statement so

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,230
it can perform the same task as the if statement,

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,360
although it has some limitations.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,270
So the if statement is basically more flexible and can have more uses.

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,760
So the structure of the select a statement is basically select case and then he test

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,930
expression and that just expression could be a value of a sell.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,750
It could be a value of variable.

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,590
It could be a formula.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,760
So like X plus y salat case X plus y.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,780
So I'm gonna test the value of X plus y.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,610
It could be also the value of a property,

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,360
for example.

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,720
So select case,

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,410
a surgeon test expression,

20
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,930
and then we're gonna have some cases,

21
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,070
some different cases,

22
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,250
so case condition one.

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,120
So we're gonna have some conditions that we're gonna test against that tests,

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,690
expression and condition basically is the value being one or the value being two,

25
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:14,460
or it can be also the value being 40 or 50 or 60 or it can be the value being between 10

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,180
and 15 as well,

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,250
and we'll see how to perform that or could be the value being less than 10.

28
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,020
For example,

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,550
all these are possible conditions that we can put on.

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,360
We will see how we can apply these.

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,770
So if condition one is Matt,

32
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,450
then code one gets executed or whatever code under condition one gets executed.

33
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,110
If that is not met,

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,990
we go and test against condition too.

35
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,670
If the condition is true,

36
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,370
then were basically gonna execute the code under and we can put as many conditions as we

37
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:47,810
want.

38
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,180
You know,

39
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,460
so condition and means that you can put any number of conditions and under each condition,

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,610
have some code to execute.

41
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,270
And we can also write case else in case else basically is.

42
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,800
If none of these conditions is true,

43
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,870
we execute whatever under the case else.

44
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:13,350
So it's like the else in the if statement and then we have an end select to indicate the

45
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,680
end of our select case statement.

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,010
And please note that if any of these conditions is Matt than the rest of the conditions are

47
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,070
not going to be tested.

48
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,950
So if we're testing and condition one gets met,

49
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,420
then we're not gonna test condition two or three.

50
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,000
And we're not gonna execute the case else.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,360
Of course,

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,770
we're just gonna execute code one and then go to the end,

53
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,760
select and end the select statement.

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,250
So that is similar to the if then else if statement if any of the conditions gets met,

55
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,280
it's were basically gonna exit the if then else if structure.

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,150
So let's see the case statement in action.

57
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,480
Okay,

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,610
so let's build a case statement together.

59
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,700
So basically,

60
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,200
let's say I'm gonna put Range D to value is equal to two,

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,420
and then we're gonna do a select A statements of select case and then range D to value.

62
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,240
So after the select case,

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,450
I need to put whatever expression I need to test,

64
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:14,970
which,

65
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,630
in this case,

66
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,080
I'm testing the value of range D two and then I'm gonna put the end select statement here

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,740
so as not to forget it.

68
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,590
And then we would put our tests or are conditions so case,

69
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,260
too.

70
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,760
So in case the values equal to two message box,

71
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,350
too,

72
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:43,160
and we could have also case less than seven message box less than seven case 40 comma 50

73
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,600
Calma 60.

74
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:52,200
Message box 40 or 50 or 60 case 12 to 15.

75
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,150
Message box between 12 and 15.

76
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,870
Case else.

77
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,270
Message box.

78
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,980
Something else.

79
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,500
Okay,

80
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,590
so let's try to execute that.

81
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,430
Select a statement here.

82
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,970
So if you go through that step by step,

83
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,670
so first of all,

84
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,120
we're gonna put the value of cell D two to be equal to two mucus ear.

85
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,850
It's been given the value of two,

86
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,150
and then we're gonna test the value of cell D to,

87
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,270
And then we're gonna execute that condition here case,

88
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,700
too.

89
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,770
So we're actually going to check if the value of cell D to is to and that is actually going

90
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,570
to be the case,

91
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,060
or we're going to get a message box,

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,370
too.

93
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,090
And you can see here that we've jumped straight away to the end,

94
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,600
select and we've not tested any other conditions and select and sub let's say we're going

95
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,950
to change the value of D two to be equal to five,

96
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,750
for example,

97
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,540
and let's test our conditions year.

98
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,670
So basically,

99
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,540
we're gonna put the values equal to five.

100
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:00,080
We're gonna test the value here if we test to that test is gonna be fools,

101
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,860
and then we're gonna test Case is less than seven.

102
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,180
So we're going to get a message box less than seven,

103
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,850
and then we jump to the end,

104
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,410
select and then and soap.

105
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:08,910
So,

106
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,040
as you could see here,

107
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,830
we test each statement.

108
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,080
And when we find that one of them is true,

109
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,240
we're actually gonna go straight away to the end,

110
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,270
select after executing the code under that particular case statement.

111
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,490
And please note that actually,

112
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,170
if you want to do the test for less than seven,

113
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,400
you don't have to write.

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,550
Case is less than seven.

115
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,480
You could write case less than seven or less than eight or whatever and then XlV be were

116
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,010
actually correct your code automatically.

117
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,380
And we understand that you want toe test.

118
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,670
If the values less than seven and it will add the is by self.

119
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,220
So I haven't written the is although you can write it,

120
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,690
of course,

121
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,840
but you don't have to memorize.

122
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,850
Remember to write it.

123
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,330
Now we're gonna do the third test here,

124
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,780
or case 40 common 50 common 60 because this test is basically another way of testing,

125
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,380
and it means that the value is either 40 or 50 or 60.

126
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:16,030
I've actually deliberately try to show you different ways off performing the test.

127
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,190
So here I'm performing a test for the cell D to being equal to a certain value than here

128
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,040
being less than certain value.

129
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,560
And here being one of three values,

130
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,240
for example,

131
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,590
And here,

132
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,980
being between some values,

133
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:37,500
some trying to show you different flavors of writing the case statement of different ways

134
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,890
to do different tests.

135
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,690
So here,

136
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,080
if we put the value of D 22 b equals to 40 for example,

137
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,410
and try to go through the code step by step,

138
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:55,070
he will see her that the test for 40 common 50 common 60 is going to go through and we're

139
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,590
going to get the message box and select and sub.

140
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,760
And also,

141
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,450
if we try to put 14.5,

142
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:07,810
the test the lost one here between 12 to 15 is actually gonna work because it can actually

143
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,570
detect decimals as well.

144
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,410
So the number doesn't have to be an integer.

145
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,350
Okay,

146
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,800
so says it all between 12 and 15.

147
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,390
And if the value does not meet any of these conditions,

148
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,420
of course we're going to go to the case else.

149
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:22,830
So,

150
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,610
for example,

151
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,950
if you put it as 52 for example,

152
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,740
we're actually going to go to the case else.

153
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,970
Something else.

154
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,150
One more thing I want to tell you about the case statement is that the or an and logic ALS

155
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,300
cannot work with the case statement.

156
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,820
So this is why it is a bit limited than the if statement.

157
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,280
So if we replaced the value of D two to be 40 for example,

158
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,060
and then were placed 40 comma,

159
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:56,050
50 comes 60 with 40 or 50 or 60 and we try the test,

160
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,140
the case statement will not work.

161
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,220
As you can see here,

162
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,750
it's by passed that test than its than the one for case else because we're not able to use

163
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,900
that Syntex with the case statement.

164
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,200
Also,

165
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,030
if we try to use,

166
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:20,350
for example greater than 39 less than 41 for example,

167
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,780
this will actually give us an error.

168
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,900
So the case statement does not work with the or and end logical.

169
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,980
So please bear that in mind.

170
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,490
So that's it for the case statement.

171
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:42,030
It's basically a way of performing tests on a certain expression and taking actions based

172
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,300
on these tests being true.

173
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,260
So ah,

174
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,950
thank you guys for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
