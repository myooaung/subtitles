1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
Okay,

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,650
guys.

3
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,940
So now we're gonna have an exercise for the workbook events.

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,350
So we're going to create a workbook event in this workbook here called workbook Events that

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,050
pops on input box whenever you try to insert a new sheet.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,500
And this input box would prompt you for the name that you would like to give to the new

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,190
sheet and then applies the name to the new sheet.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,150
So here,

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,430
if I try to insert a new sheet,

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,870
you can see here I get an input box says please type the name that you would like to give

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,220
to the new sheet and then I can type any name,

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,560
maybe test click,

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,150
OK,

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,380
and the name is applied to the new sheet.

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,970
So this is the kind of functionality that you need you to create using workbook events.

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:44,650
Okay,

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,360
so please attempt exercise,

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,490
And if you get stuck,

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,910
you can have a look at the answer here in this exercise answer module.

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,300
Of course,

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:59,640
you need to copy the code to this workbook here to be able to run the event.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,320
Okay,

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,680
so pleases them.

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,430
They exercise.

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,760
And if you have any questions,

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,810
please leave them in the Q and a section.

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,150
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see on the next one
