00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hey,

2
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.550
guys,

3
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.140
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.310
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.030
we're going to discuss the difference between recording macros in absolute mode and

6
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.610
recording them in relative mode.

7
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.550
So the best way to illustrate the differences to illustrate it with an example.

8
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.870
So,

9
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.390
basically,

10
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.740
air,

11
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.350
I'm gonna start recording a new micro,

12
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.790
so I'm gonna go to the developer top here,

13
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.700
Click on record,

14
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.260
Macro.

15
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.770
And the first backer is gonna be an absolute mode.

16
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.790
So I'm just going to write its name.

17
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.440
It's gonna be absolute macro,

18
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.930
and then I'm going to click.

19
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.720
OK,

20
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.130
so now I'm going to select cell a one and put a one in it and then put two and sell a two

21
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.190
and then three in cell a three and then I'm going to stop recording.

22
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.590
So now if we examine the code on the macro here.

23
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.630
So as you can see here,

24
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.440
the coat says,

25
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.810
Go to sell a one,

26
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.770
put one,

27
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.150
go to sell a to put to go,

28
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.170
to sell a three,

29
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.100
put three and then it's selected a four.

30
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.410
Because when you press enter,

31
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.180
we go to the cell that is below the current cell.

32
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.840
So if we just delete the 1213 year in cells,

33
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.960
a one a two and three and try to run the macro again.

34
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.430
You can see here that we got 12 and three put in cells a one,

35
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.680
a two and a three.

36
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.710
Every single time we run the macro,

37
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.440
we will just get this same result.

38
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.170
Okay,

39
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.790
Now let's try to record the macro in relative mode.

40
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.360
So why the previous marker was an absolute motive was because we did not click on this

41
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.100
button here that says use relative references.

42
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.210
So let's see when we recorded INR Altimo.

43
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.520
So I'm gonna click on record.

44
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.640
Macro here on,

45
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.950
I'm gonna name it relative Micro here and I'm gonna click.

46
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.660
OK,

47
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.930
gonna use relative references here.

48
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.620
Put one in cell D 42 and then three and then stop recording.

49
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.640
And let's examine the code again.

50
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.470
So as you can see here,

51
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.280
it says,

52
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.890
put one in the current Salva is active and then go one cell downwards.

53
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.570
Put two and then go one cell downwards and put a three.

54
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.850
So this is what the relative code says,

55
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.680
and this means that it's actually gonna put 12 and three,

56
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.790
depending on which cell is selected,

57
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.720
it is relative,

58
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.150
so it's gonna be relative to the selected sell.

59
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.280
So if I select,

60
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.880
for example,

61
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.350
cell F four on Run,

62
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.980
the relative macro is gonna put 1213 in F four,

63
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.160
F five and F six if I select another cell here J for runway relative macro,

64
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.520
we get 12 and three in J four j five j six.

65
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.760
So it's relative to the current selected cell.

66
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.960
It's not absolute when we use the absolute macro each and every time you run it.

67
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.530
As you can see,

68
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.250
I'm going to run the absolute macro.

69
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.360
So each and every time it's run,

70
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.260
it puts 12 and three and sells a one a two a three each time it puts 12 and three in the

71
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.280
same location.

72
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.260
But the 2nd 1 here is relatives who is relative to the selected sell.

73
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.550
So that is the difference between recording in absolute mood and recording in relative mode

74
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.550
.

75
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.890
So how do you know whether you're in absolute mode or in relative mode?

76
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.670
It's through this,

77
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.340
but if this button is shaded,

78
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.650
use relative references.

79
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.690
If it is shaded like now,

80
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.640
then you are in relative mode.

81
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.380
If you press on it again and remove the shade,

82
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.540
you can see here you're back to absolute mode when recording.

83
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.180
Okay,

84
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.050
so that is the difference between the absolute mode and relative mode when recording macros

85
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.050
.

86
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.800
And I still want you not to worry.

87
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.870
If you don't understand the code for now,

88
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.890
you won't be able to understand it as we progress through the course.

89
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.770
So thank you very much watching this video,

90
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.620
and I'll see you on the next one.
