1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
and this video,

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,000
we're going to start writing our first macro on.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,410
Also,

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,950
we will get to know the range object in Excel.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,690
So the range object in Excel is basically an object that allows us to deal with cells in

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,670
XlV b A and to start writing our first macro,

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,730
we need to first will go to Developer Tab on the ribbon here and click on visual basic.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,400
And that's to open the visual basic environment.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,680
Now,

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,220
to write a macro,

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,740
we need to insert a module first of all,

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,760
So to insert a new module,

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,920
we could go to this insert module to here,

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,450
click on this arrow and then click on module.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,360
Okay,

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,900
we can also go to the insert tab on the ribbon and click on module.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,240
Okay,

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,840
so that's another way to do it.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,290
Okay,

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,980
so now I'm going to start writing my first macro.

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,360
So to do that,

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,060
to start writing a macro,

23
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,860
first of all,

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,600
I need to give it a name.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,610
So I need to write the word sub and then write the macron's name.

26
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,960
And the Macron's name should not include any spaces,

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,290
and he cannot contain dashes as well.

28
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,880
It can contain underscores so you can separate words with underscores.

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,490
But I'm just going to name it first macro.

30
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,540
Okay.

31
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,890
And then when I press enter,

32
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,350
I pressed Enter several times just to give myself some space.

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:33,630
And when a press enter XlV b A will insert the end sub statement which marks the end of my

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,260
macro.

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,280
At this end,

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,080
sub statement is going to be inserted automatically.

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,390
Now the macron's name cannot contain some certain words that are reserved in XlV B A.

38
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,470
I'll include a pdf in the resource is section about these words for you.

39
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,040
Okay,

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,130
so basically the sub statement and the name of the macro marks the start of my macro or sir

41
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,490
procedure and the end sub marks the end of my PSA procedure,

42
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,160
or macro,

43
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,930
and between the sub and the end sub statements,

44
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,660
I'm going to write Maher instructions.

45
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm going to write some lines of codes that excel.

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,850
VB A will perform step by step from top to bottom.

47
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:24,340
So vve a will go through these instructions from top to bottom and execute them that way.

48
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,630
Okay,

49
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,360
so this is how instructions are executed in xlv b A.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,130
There is sticky,

51
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,770
executed from top to bottom.

52
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,230
Of course,

53
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,790
you can move around in the macro by writing some special lines that we will learn about

54
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,170
later on in the course.

55
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,690
Okay,

56
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,260
so let's start dealing with the range object.

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,400
So,

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,230
first of all,

59
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,760
we're gonna learn how to change the value of a single cell,

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,430
OK?

61
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,680
And I'm gonna have the visual basic environment open here,

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,790
and you're gonna be able to see part of the Excel grid here and the background because

63
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,430
we're gonna perform actions here with the V b A environment,

64
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,270
and you're gonna be able to see the results of these actions in the background.

65
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,730
Okay.

66
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,310
Okay.

67
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,970
So to change the value of a single cell,

68
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,720
you can write range,

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,190
then open brackets and then open double quotes.

70
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,440
And then you put the reference for the cell.

71
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,920
I'm going to change the value of cell a one,

72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,580
Okay.

73
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,970
And then close double quotes.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:29,980
And then I'm going to close parentheses year and then equals 15 for example.

75
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,810
Okay,

76
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,150
so I'm gonna put the value of 15 in cell a one.

77
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,960
Okay,

78
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,410
So in order to run the macro,

79
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,080
we need to either click on this button here at the top,

80
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,620
which is the run button.

81
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,680
Or you can also hit F five on your keyboard.

82
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,160
So I'm gonna click on this button here,

83
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,560
and,

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,690
as you can see here,

85
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,650
the value of 15 husband inserted into cell a one.

86
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,870
Okay,

87
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,100
So if I need to affect actually a range of cells,

88
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,670
not just a single cell.

89
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,670
And this is actually for a contiguous range of cells.

90
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,590
We're gonna actually put a colon after the reference for the first cell and then put the

91
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,060
reference of the ending cell.

92
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,630
Okay,

93
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,010
So I'm gonna effect,

94
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,850
for example,

95
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,600
a 12 f Then,

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,410
for example,

97
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm gonna put the value of 15 in range a 12 f done.

98
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,000
And this is actually how you can select a range of cells in Excel as well.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,450
So in excel.

100
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,250
If you right here a 12 f done.

101
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,360
Okay,

102
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,790
You're gonna be able to select the whole range a 12 f done.

103
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,500
OK,

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,660
so if we execute this line of code here,

105
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,050
if I press on the run button here,

106
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,250
the cells a 12 f done are gonna be getting the value off 15.

107
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,990
Okay,

108
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,440
so to start writing another line of code.

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,070
You can just press enter on your keyboard.

110
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm gonna press enter again because I like to have more than one line actually separating

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,550
my my lines of coat because this makes the readability easier for me.

112
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,950
But actually,

113
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,750
any space that you put between the lines of code will not affect your macro at all.

114
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,740
It will not affect its speed or execution at all.

115
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,450
Okay?

116
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,850
And I'm gonna start writing,

117
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,710
for example,

118
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,310
another line of code here.

119
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,560
So range,

120
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,540
then I'm gonna open parentheses,

121
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,870
open double quotes,

122
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,660
for example,

123
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,530
Jeanine,

124
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,150
and then closed.

125
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,770
Double coast close parentheses equals 150.

126
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,550
Okay.

127
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,650
And as you can see here,

128
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,940
even though I typed the word ranging all in uppercase excel actually corrected it and it's

129
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,060
made only the first letter is uppercase,

130
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,520
and the rest of the letters are lower case.

131
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,790
And even though also,

132
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,200
I have typed g nine,

133
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,710
the G in lower case,

134
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,790
this will not affect the execution of the code.

135
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,500
Okay,

136
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,750
So Excel was still understand that this is sell Jeanine.

137
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,410
So I'm gonna delete the values in these cells here,

138
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,540
and I'm gonna execute the code again.

139
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,200
Here So if I execute this code,

140
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:31,360
you can see here that all the cells from a 12 f done have acquired the value of 15.

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,770
And Celgene owing has acquired the value of 150.

142
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,420
Okay,

143
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,790
now,

144
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,210
of course,

145
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,380
as we stated earlier,

146
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,930
Excel has executed these lines of code step by step.

147
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,320
Okay,

148
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,720
so the first line here,

149
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,130
a one two F 10 equals 15 has been executed first,

150
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:56,690
and then the line G nine equals to 150 has been executed second or afterwards.

151
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,480
And of course,

152
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,340
you do not notice that because they're both executed in a flash.

153
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:02,660
Okay,

154
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,340
but just know that they are executed step by step,

155
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,950
okay?

156
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,290
They have not been executed together.

157
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:08,900
Actually,

158
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,880
this line of court has been executed first,

159
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,400
and then this line of code.

160
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,360
Okay,

161
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,520
so I've seen how to affect the value off a single cell.

162
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,050
And also,

163
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,210
we've seen how to affect the value of a contiguous range of cells.

164
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:30,650
We're going to see as well now how to affect the value of none contiguous cells.

165
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,160
OK,

166
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,440
so I'm going to leave these lines of code.

167
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,210
I'm gonna delete this,

168
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,710
Aziz.

169
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,040
Well,

170
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,340
here on my Excel grid,

171
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,420
and I'm gonna start affecting a range of none contiguous cells.

172
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,170
That means that the cells are not beside each other.

173
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,880
OK,

174
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,500
so I'm going to write range on,

175
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,990
then open parentheses,

176
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,160
open double quotes,

177
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,520
and then maybe l a one and then comma and then f done.

178
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,460
Okay.

179
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,200
And then close double quotes.

180
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,050
Close parentheses equals 1000.

181
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,180
Okay,

182
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,190
so this actually will put the value of 1000 in cells a one and F 10 but only in these two

183
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,770
cells.

184
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,220
Not this sells between them.

185
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,260
So if I run this code here for you,

186
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,420
press on my run button,

187
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,650
you can see year on,

188
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,410
sell a one and sell f done on Lee.

189
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:33,290
Only these two cells the value of 1000 has been put in these two cells on lee.

190
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,450
And actually,

191
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,510
the cells between them are still blank.

192
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,990
So this is how you can affect the values of none contiguous cells.

193
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,230
Okay,

194
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:50,260
so I want to show you as well that you can actually mix between a range of contiguous cells

195
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,390
and a single cell in one range objects statement here,

196
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,630
so you can write actually range a 12 f turn,

197
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,160
and then a comma,

198
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,520
and then f 15 equals 1000.

199
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,810
And what's gonna happen here when we run?

200
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:14,450
This statement is that sells a 12 F 10 are gonna acquire the value of 1000 and sell F 15 as

201
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,330
well is going to acquire the value of 1000.

202
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,750
So I'm gonna delete here the values on my Excel grid here,

203
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,480
and I'm gonna go back to my visual basic environment.

204
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,270
And when I click on the play button here,

205
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,680
what's what's gonna happen here?

206
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,260
You can see her cells a 12 F then have acquired the value of 1000 and sell F 15 as well has

207
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,240
acquired the value of 1000.

208
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,790
Okay.

209
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,150
And this is equivalent to actually writing that on two statements.

210
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,770
Okay,

211
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,060
so we can write range.

212
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:55,540
A 12 f turn equals 1000 and then range of 15 is equal to 1000.

213
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,740
So if we leave that and then run the code again,

214
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,210
we're going to get the same result.

215
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,540
Okay,

216
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,680
so if you run that,

217
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,210
we're going to actually get the same result here.

218
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:08,930
Okay,

219
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,190
guys.

220
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,500
So in this lecture,

221
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,870
we've written our first macro and We've had an introduction to the range object.

222
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,460
In the upcoming lectures.

223
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,040
We're going to dive deeper into the range object,

224
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,690
and we're gonna learn a lot more about it,

225
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,620
so Ah,

226
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:23,960
thanks,

227
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,170
guys,

228
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,550
for watching this video.

229
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,830
I know.

230
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,050
See on the next one.
