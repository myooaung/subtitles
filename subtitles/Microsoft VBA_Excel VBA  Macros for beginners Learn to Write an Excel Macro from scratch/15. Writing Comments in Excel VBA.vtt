Hey,

2
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.520
guys,

3
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.220
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.150
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.670
we're going to speak about comments in XlV B A.

6
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.700
So you can actually write some comments on your code.

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.090
And these comments are just notes for yourself,

8
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.410
and these lines will not be executed.

9
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.230
So to write a comment,

10
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.050
you just need to put a single quote and then start writing whatever you want to write,

11
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.950
and then it's gonna get a green color,

12
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.870
as you can see here,

13
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:31.280
and this is a common so any green line will not be executed because it's just a common.

14
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.870
You will find me putting comments on the code because it's a good programing practice to

15
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.020
put comments on the code because this enables other people who had read your code to

16
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.520
understand it easier.

17
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.780
And also you will see me sometimes use them to comment some lines of code in order not to

18
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.710
be executed.

19
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.910
So this is just a quick overview about Commons in XlV.

20
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.140
Be a thank you very much watching this video,

21
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.650
and I'll see you on the next one
