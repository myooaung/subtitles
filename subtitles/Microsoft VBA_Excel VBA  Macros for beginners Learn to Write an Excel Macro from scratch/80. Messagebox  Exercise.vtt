00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.370
Okay,

2
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.630
guys.

3
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.390
So now we're gonna have an exercise for the message box.

4
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.780
So in this exercise,

5
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.890
I need you to create a message box that would ask you whether you would like to clear the

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.310
data or not.

7
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.260
And this message box needs to have yes and no buttons.

8
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.360
And it also needs to have the VB question sign.

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.980
So using this message box when you're asked whether you'd like to clear the data or not,

10
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.310
you're going to either clear the data on the left or not clear it.

11
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.570
So if you click,

12
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.240
Yes,

13
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.870
then the date on the left would be cleared.

14
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.520
Except for the headers.

15
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.110
You're not going to clear the headers.

16
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.950
You're just gonna clear the data.

17
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.830
And if you click no than the macro ends and as a note,

18
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.170
please make sure to find the last row and clear on Lee the Rose having the data and not all

19
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.030
the rows on the columns a toe after.

20
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.460
Don't select all the rose to the very bottom,

21
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.520
the work sheet,

22
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.940
and then clear them.

23
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.270
No,

24
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.220
that's not efficient.

25
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.100
I need you to find what the last row is and only select from row two till the last row and

26
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.680
then you're gonna need to use the range dot clear contents method.

27
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.490
It's a very easy method.

28
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.470
This method just clears the data in these cells in a range object so it can be used with

29
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.420
the range object.

30
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.450
And it can also be used with the cells collection object.

31
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.010
You can go,

32
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.190
go.

33
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.340
It's page on a misty.

34
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.820
Understand?

35
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.970
I'm not gonna give you the link.

36
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.960
I need you to Google.

37
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.720
It's page on the MSD on and read about it is very easy.

38
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.280
And then I needed to assign the macro to the above button and test it okay,

39
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.770
and make sure it's working fine.

40
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.280
If you have any issues and you want to try again after leading the data,

41
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.650
here is a backup copy of the data,

42
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.460
so you can copy the data again,

43
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.310
put it back and test it.

44
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.400
And if you get stuck,

45
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.640
I've got the answer here for this exercise in this exercise answer module.

46
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.750
So if you get stuck,

47
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.870
have a look at the answer.

48
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.940
So please attempt the exercise.

49
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.380
And if you have any questions,

50
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.450
please leave them in the Q and a section.

51
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.270
Thank you very much.

52
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.200
Watching this video.

53
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.460
I'll see you on the next one
