00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
Okay,

2
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.670
guys.

3
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.720
So now we're going to see how to add a new line.

4
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.210
So as toe have two sentences written in two separate lines.

5
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.330
So let's say we want to write these two sentences year Jack loves pizza,

6
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.150
and Joe loves chocolate.

7
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.740
Who want to write these in two separate lines,

8
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.630
maybe inside a message box or in any other application in V B A.

9
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.310
So we're gonna have message box.

10
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.230
Jack loves pizza.

11
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.240
And then and then we're gonna put an M percent a space and then an M person and the species

12
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.210
really important.

13
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.600
And then vb new line and then a space and then an m percent.

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.170
And then Joe loves chocolate.

15
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.950
Okay,

16
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.880
so this way we will have these two sentences written in two separate lines.

17
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.460
So if you run the code here we have Jack close pizza and then in a new line.

18
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.610
Joe loves chocolate,

19
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.380
and it's very important to put a space between the different elements here.

20
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.900
So if you don't put a space and you click away,

21
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.560
you can see her that you get an error.

22
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.930
Okay,

23
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.870
so you need to make sure that you put a space between the VB new line and the M percent and

24
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.410
the second statement,

25
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.860
The statement is gonna go on the second line here and the same goes for the statement on

26
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.030
the first line as well.

27
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.600
On the VB,

28
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.720
new line is a constant and it is used to separate elements in different lines and you can

29
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.250
also use V B c R.

30
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.950
LF,

31
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.380
and this stands for visual basic courage,

32
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.160
return line feed.

33
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.330
And this is a bit of an older statement.

34
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.260
So this is the new modern one vb new line and I personally prefer this one because it's

35
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.820
easier to remember its name is intuitive.

36
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.750
It's easy to remember.

37
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.480
So this is how you can put different statements in separate lines in xlv b A.

38
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.040
And you can use this in any xlv.

39
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.800
Be application where you need to deal with strings.

40
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.380
Basically.

41
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.050
Okay,

42
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.650
so thanks for watching.

43
00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.750
I'll see on the next one
