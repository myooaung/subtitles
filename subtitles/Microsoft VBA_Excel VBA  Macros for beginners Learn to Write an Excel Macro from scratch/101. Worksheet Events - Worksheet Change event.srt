1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,190
Hey,

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,480
guys,

3
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,080
welcome back.

4
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,950
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,920
we're going to discuss the worksheet change events.

6
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,440
So the work she change event gets triggered whenever a cell in your worksheet gets changed

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,440
,

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,400
either by yourself as user or by an external link.

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
So any change,

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,650
really,

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,750
that happens to a cell in your worksheet is going to trigger the worksheet change event.

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,700
Okay,

13
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,590
so let's illustrate that by a simple examples I've got here a sheet cold work,

14
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,390
she change event and just going right,

15
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,380
click on it and click on view code,

16
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,200
and then go to work sheet on this menu here and then click on change even.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,010
Okay.

18
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,470
And then I'm just gonna delete this worksheet selection change event because we don't need

19
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,750
it.

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,700
And now I'm just gonna put a message box here.

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,960
You made a change on your worksheet.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,570
Okay,

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,050
this message box is gonna be triggered whenever I make a change on a cell in my worksheet.

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,130
This is different from the selection change,

25
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,350
though This election change gets triggered whenever you select a different cell.

26
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,890
But you see now it's not being triggered because this is not what triggers it.

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,540
What triggers it is changing something on a sheet.

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,310
A case?

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,760
You change the contents of a cell.

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,340
Then this message baskets triggered.

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,940
You made the change on your worksheet.

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,320
Okay,

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,590
so this is how you can trigger the worksheet change event.

34
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,660
Even if you delete the contents of the cell.

35
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,200
This also triggers the worksheet change even.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,760
Okay,

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,790
so let's have a more sophisticated example.

38
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,890
Okay,

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,290
so let's say on this column on column B.

40
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,570
What I want to do is when I put a value,

41
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,320
I wanted to be multiplied by a 1,000,000.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,610
OK,

43
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,510
so let's say on this column,

44
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,160
you need to be entering values.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,100
The are million's okay.

46
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,660
And you just want if you want to put two million,

47
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,750
you just put a two and then excel adjust multiplied by a 1,000,000 it will be two million.

48
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,890
The value will be two million.

49
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,340
But you don't wanna type two and then six zeros or two multiplied by 10.

50
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,770
Race to the par six each time you input the value,

51
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,210
okay?

52
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,010
Or so you don't want a multiplier value by a 1,000,000.

53
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,140
You don't want to type a lot of zeros.

54
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,260
You just want to put the number okay and then accept will multiplied by one million.

55
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,740
Because this is our objective on this column on column B.

56
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,150
We want to do that.

57
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,020
Okay,

58
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,230
so let's see how we conduce that.

59
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,640
And we're going to face some obstacles actually,

60
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,050
to see how we can do that.

61
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,910
So I'm gonna go here too.

62
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,440
My worksheet change event.

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,970
And then I'm going to start typing if Target because this has a target parameter.

64
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,750
And the target is basically the cell that you changed.

65
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,160
Okay,

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,160
So if target dot column equals two okay,

67
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,990
that means it's in column beats in the second column.

68
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,240
Then let's put Marr and if here Okay,

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,400
So if target dark column equals do what do we want to do?

70
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,990
We actually want to multiply our value by a 1,000,000.

71
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,260
OK,

72
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,370
so target of value is equal to target thought value,

73
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,650
okay.

74
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,840
And then multiplied by we can't put a 10 race to the part six here.

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,790
We cannot do that.

76
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,950
We will get an error.

77
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,810
You can't do that in VB A.

78
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,540
What you want to do is to actually call a worksheet function,

79
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:33,850
okay,

80
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,460
so you can actually call a function a normal cell function,

81
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,860
normal worksheet function from XlV B A.

82
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,950
So how do you do that?

83
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,550
Okay,

84
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,800
so is this something new work that we're gonna learn here?

85
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,450
Application.

86
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:53,250
You could write application dot worksheets function and then dot and then you choose the

87
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,610
function.

88
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,590
There's a function called power in Excel.

89
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:56,810
Okay,

90
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,410
this is a functioning normally excel called power.

91
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,030
Okay.

92
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,690
And what this function it does is a accepts two inputs.

93
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,340
The first imp.

94
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,670
It is basically the number that you that you want to race to a certain power cyst the base

95
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:12,670
.

96
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,040
Okay,

97
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,350
So is gonna be 10 and then,

98
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,250
Ah,

99
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,410
the power itself is going to be six.

100
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:25,130
That means that the value of the cell that we're changing is gonna be multiplied by tend to

101
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:25,800
the par six.

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,010
A target of value cause targeted a value multiplied by 10 to the power six.

103
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,890
Okay,

104
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,340
So see what's gonna happen if we just leave the code.

105
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,140
Is that because this is not gonna work as we want to see what's gonna happen here?

106
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,840
Let's say I want to write two million.

107
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,120
Okay,

108
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,140
So I want to write just two,

109
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,520
and then excel will just convert it to two million or make it.

110
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,200
Two million.

111
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,430
OK,

112
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,420
so I'm going to write to here and look at this numbers.

113
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,290
A very big numbers to multiplied by 10 to the power 306.

114
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:07,500
So that's two multiplied by 10 to the power 306 0 that's not the number that we wanted.

115
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,970
We just wanted 10 2 million.

116
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,440
That's it.

117
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,920
We don't We didn't want this big number.

118
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,850
So what happened here?

119
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,930
What's happened?

120
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,680
Well,

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,380
what happened is that the change that you made in the cell has been action recursive lee

122
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,030
cases.

123
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,550
It's like in a recursive action,

124
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,030
because you changed the content of the cell and that triggered to change.

125
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,450
And then the change triggered another change,

126
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,490
and another change in another changed and an excel kept actually multiplying the value by

127
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,000
tend to the power six,

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,520
you know,

129
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,340
until it reached.

130
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,730
Actually,

131
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,220
the the biggest number that an Excel cell can handle in this case,

132
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,630
actually,

133
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,030
biggest number that Excel Cell can handle is I think it's 10 to the power 307 or something

134
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,360
like that.

135
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,300
But this is the biggest number that the cell could handle,

136
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:03,820
so just kept on multiplying the number the result by tend to the party six is like to buy,

137
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,720
tend to the par six.

138
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,970
And then it takes the product of that and then multiplies it by 10 to the par six.

139
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,570
And then it takes the product of that and then multiplies it by 10 34 6 and keeps on doing

140
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:20,750
that until reaching the highest value that Excel can handle.

141
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,800
Okay,

142
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,860
so this is what basically happened.

143
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,010
The number kept on multiplying itself by 10 to the poor six.

144
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,770
Okay.

145
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,180
So to help you understand what happened better.

146
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,390
Let's step through the code,

147
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,490
go through the code step by step.

148
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,150
Okay.

149
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,470
Eso I'm actually going to lead the content of the cell here,

150
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,000
and you can see here that the event still has been triggered,

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,590
but we're having a zero because it's multiplying zero byte under the par six.

152
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,220
And so it's resulting zero.

153
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,240
And even with the recursive reaction is just resulting a zero.

154
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,390
So I'm just gonna go back here,

155
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:00,840
and I'm gonna put a break point in my code at this line so that the code would stop

156
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,180
executing at this line here,

157
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,630
and then we're going to start executing it manually.

158
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:11,220
So I'm gonna put too in here and you consider this.

159
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,720
The event has been triggered,

160
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,640
but it's the code stopped at this line at the break point that I set.

161
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,070
No,

162
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,630
I'm gonna press f eight to continue executing the code.

163
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,260
So the first time it's been executed,

164
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,790
it's resulted in two million.

165
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:31,090
Now this has triggered a change event and then it's it's resulted in multiplying it by

166
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,950
another 10 to the poor.

167
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,950
Six is now what tend to the poor 12.

168
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,330
And if you keep pressing,

169
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:41,940
F eight is now 10 to the power to multiple but tentative poor 18 and then it is stunned to

170
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,650
the poor 24 then it's time to a poor 30 of 36.

171
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,270
So I'm executing the code manually using F eight.

172
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,900
This is actually one of the best ways to troubleshoot events event codes,

173
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,340
in case you're having a problem with with VB a code that you've written in an event.

174
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,560
Okay,

175
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,800
put a ah break point and then start executing the code manually.

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,190
OK,

177
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,450
so we're doing that.

178
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,180
You can see her.

179
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,520
The code is still being executed and the event is still being triggered.

180
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
It's ah recursive reaction.

181
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,930
OK?

182
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,420
It's like a chain reaction is just a a change,

183
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,000
you know,

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,290
triggering a change which triggers a change which triggers a change.

185
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,650
And this keeps happening until we actually where we going to stop?

186
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,600
We're actually going to stop at the highest number that this cell could handle.

187
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:25,940
OK,

188
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,110
so if there was,

189
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,290
ah,

190
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,260
higher numbers,

191
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,330
Excel would still,

192
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,180
you know,

193
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,660
keep on multiplying the result by 10 to the power six.

194
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,160
Okay,

195
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,940
then we and the if and so on.

196
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,250
Actually,

197
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,850
excel still wants to do it,

198
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,500
but actually,

199
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,030
this is the the highest number that Selcan handles.

200
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,120
Excel wants to still execute the change,

201
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,100
but there's no we can't go any higher on the cell because this is the highest number that

202
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,240
we can go on the cell.

203
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,210
Is this crazy?

204
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,510
Okay,

205
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,330
so I'm just going to stop all that craziness,

206
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,590
and now we're going to see how we can solve that problem.

207
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,680
So I'm going to remove the break point and let's see how we can solve that problem.

208
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,410
Okay,

209
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,580
so this is where disabling events is handy.

210
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,200
This is where disabling events becomes handy.

211
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,700
So,

212
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,000
actually,

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,470
if you add on application dot enable events for the line of code here application that

214
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:31,580
enable events equals foals here before we execute this line of code.

215
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,550
And then we could actually enable the events after the if statement.

216
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:35,820
Okay,

217
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,150
So before ending the sub,

218
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:42,380
where at any point that we find convenience a convenient.

219
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:42,660
Okay,

220
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,550
so application dot enable events equals true.

221
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,230
We will not have this problem.

222
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,970
Okay,

223
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,010
so let's see that again.

224
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,670
Let's right to Nikon's here.

225
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,180
We just got two million is,

226
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,400
too,

227
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,440
with six zeroes beside it.

228
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,700
So what happened here is we actually checked that were in the second column here,

229
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,860
and then we disabled the events,

230
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,440
okay?

231
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,650
And we executed that line of code,

232
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,450
which is multiplying to buy 10 to the par six.

233
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,280
Okay.

234
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,490
And then we enabled it back after there was nothing to trigger the event.

235
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,410
So this is what happened.

236
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:25,590
Now,

237
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,660
if you write any number here five,

238
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,360
for example,

239
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,200
we're gonna have five million a proper 5,000,050.

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,870
We're gonna have 50 million.

241
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,720
Just 50 million,

242
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,350
not a you know,

243
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,410
50 by tend to the power 307 or something like that.

244
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:40,930
Okay,

245
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:46,620
so this is where the disabling events comes handy.

246
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,350
Okay,

247
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,300
this is Ah,

248
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,160
simple example.

249
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,110
You need to make sure to use your tools,

250
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,760
your tools,

251
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,140
right.

252
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:00,870
And you need to know one to disable the events in order to get the results that you want.

253
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,730
Okay.

254
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,490
To thank you guys for watching this video,

255
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,570
I'll see on the next.
