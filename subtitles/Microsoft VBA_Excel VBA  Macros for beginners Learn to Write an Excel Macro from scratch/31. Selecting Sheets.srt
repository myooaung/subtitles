1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
Alright,

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,770
guys.

3
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,230
So now in this section,

4
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,660
we're going to start dealing with worksheets.

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,710
So we're gonna learn how to deal with worksheets,

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,520
and the first thing we're gonna learn is actually selecting worksheets.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,790
Okay,

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,730
So when you're selecting worksheets,

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,610
if you need to select a certain sheet,

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:27,900
you actually need to call the worksheets collection and then tell Excel which sheet you

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,580
would like to select.

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,190
So here I'm gonna call the worksheets collection object and then tell the worksheets

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,150
collection object.

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,720
The I need sheet one from that collection.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,340
Okay,

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:47,570
is we have described before in the introduction lecture on how the syntax of BV a works.

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,810
So here there is a collection you're gonna call one member of the collection,

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,810
which is sheet one,

19
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,140
and then you're going to write dot select.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,270
So this is a method select is a method,

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,610
So this will make you select sheet one you can see here.

22
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,300
I've got two sheets in this workbook sheet.

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,960
One and she too.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,600
So I'm gonna actually select she to here,

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,450
and then I'm going to run this code,

26
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,100
and this will select sheet one,

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,250
as you can see here.

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,380
Okay,

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,620
guys.

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,620
So now we've seen how we could select a worksheet with the work she dot select method.

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,690
But I actually wanted to show you something else about the select method as well,

32
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,950
which is that there is a parameter in the select method cold replace.

33
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,130
And I'm here on the page for the worksheets dot select method on the Microsoft Directory

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,580
Network,

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,680
which I actually got by Googling because highlighting it in the V B a editor and pressing F

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,240
one did not get me to that page for some reason.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,250
But I just googled worksheet dot select method MST in and I was able to get that so you can

38
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,930
see her there is actually a replaced parameter.

39
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,420
What this replaced parameter does is that it allows us to select several sheets at the same

40
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,910
time.

41
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,950
So remember,

42
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,260
guys,

43
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,370
parameters are like adverbs.

44
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,590
They actually describe how the verb is done.

45
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,390
So this is actually going to describe how the dot select method,

46
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,350
which is considered a verb,

47
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,230
you know,

48
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,830
as we're mimicking the structure of the English language,

49
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,080
is we've explained before,

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,790
So the replaces going to describe how the dots select method is going to be done.

51
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,410
Okay,

52
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,390
so if you put replace equal to false.

53
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,960
This means that there is not going to be a replacement when you do another selection.

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,450
So that means that you're going to select multiple sheets at the same time.

55
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,770
But if you put it equals to two than that means that you will not be selecting multiple

56
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,550
sheets at the same time and is actually this true is the default value for the replace

57
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,360
parameter.

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,680
Okay,

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,250
so let's go back to the visual basic environment and see that in action.

60
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,520
Okay,

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,750
guys,

62
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,770
so we're back to the visual basic environment.

63
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,520
So let's say I want to select she to in addition to sheet one at the same time so it can

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,560
actually select two sheets at the same time.

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,300
You could do it in the Excel environment.

66
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,960
If you press control,

67
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,200
you know,

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,130
select one sheet press control and select the other one year in a select two sheets at the

69
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,760
same time.

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,720
So we want to be able to do that in visual basic as well.

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,110
I'm just gonna Owen group them to be able to just select sheet one.

72
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,870
So let's say I wanna select she to.

73
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,140
In addition to sheet one.

74
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,910
So I'm going to write worksheets she to dot select And then I'm gonna press space and I'm

75
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,380
gonna write the replace parameter,

76
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,070
so I'm going to write,

77
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,650
Replace colon equals false.

78
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,380
Okay,

79
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,650
So the replace parameter when you said it equal to false,

80
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,520
you're gonna actually be able to select both these sheets at the same time.

81
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,270
So actually,

82
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,960
the first selection is gonna happen on then the second selection will have the parameter

83
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,320
replace equals two false.

84
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,840
And that means that it's gonna happen in addition to the first selection.

85
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,850
So if you run that,

86
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,050
you consider that both sheets have been selected at the same time.

87
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,280
So if you actually add 1/3 sheet,

88
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,550
you can also select it this way so you can select the three sheets at the same time.

89
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:21,050
So if you add a line so I'm just gonna copy that and just replace it with she three,

90
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,700
you can select the third sheet as well.

91
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,070
So if you keep adding the selection lines with replace equals two false,

92
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,780
you're gonna be able to select that particular sheet in addition to the sheets previously

93
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,570
selected.

94
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,350
Okay.

95
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,160
And of course,

96
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,960
if we put to replace equals two true than your sheet will not be selected in addition to

97
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,710
the other sheets,

98
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,310
but it's actually equals two.

99
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,830
True,

100
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,600
by default,

101
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,120
if you're gonna set a equals the true,

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,080
you're not gonna write it,

103
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,450
right?

104
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,930
But if you run that with,

105
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,230
you know,

106
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,550
without putting the replace or by putting the replace equals true,

107
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,490
then actually it will just select sheet one and then selectively to But when When it

108
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,850
selectively to is gonna de select sheet one and then whose election three And when it

109
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,430
selects C three is gonna de selection too.

110
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,930
So that means that in the end,

111
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,550
you will just have she three selected because it's just in a selected one and then select

112
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,150
you to and then selection three.

113
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,120
We can run a actually step by step by pressing f eight.

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,610
So here,

115
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,370
if you run,

116
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,930
that line of code is gonna select sheet one,

117
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,260
and then if you run,

118
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,920
the 2nd 1 is going to actually to.

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,810
And then if you won,

120
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,070
the third one's just gets the luxury three.

121
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,780
So it just selects them exclusively.

122
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,980
So the newly selection sheet does not get at it to the old cheat So that's it for the

123
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,850
worksheets start select method.

124
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,390
This is one of the basic things that you will need to learn when dealing with sheets,

125
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,930
which is how you can select sheets.

126
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,750
Okay,

127
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,190
thank you very much watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
