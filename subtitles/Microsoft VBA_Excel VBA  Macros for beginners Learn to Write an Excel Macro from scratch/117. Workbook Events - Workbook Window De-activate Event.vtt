00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
Okay,

2
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.610
guys.

3
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.610
So now we're going to speak about the window,

4
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.850
deactivate events.

5
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.750
So the window deactivate event works the same way as the window activate event.

6
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.680
Except that it worked on deactivating the window instead of activating the window.

7
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.980
And also,

8
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.860
I'm going to compare it to the workbook deactivate event as well.

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.520
So actually,

10
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.630
it's has the same relationship as the relationship between the activate and the window

11
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.230
activate that we've discussed on the previous video.

12
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.830
So I've got here the message boxes that I had except that I just changed them to

13
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.280
deactivated on each one.

14
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.880
Okay,

15
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.200
so I've got pretty much the same set up here as the one that I had on the previous video on

16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.200
.

17
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.620
Now,

18
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.290
if I activate a window here online workbook that schooled workbook events and now I'm going

19
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.860
to deactivate and then go to another window he could see air that axity only the message

20
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010
box for deactivating the window works.

21
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.720
But the message box for deactivating the workbook does not work because we have not moved

22
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.580
to another workbook.

23
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.270
We have moved to the same workbook.

24
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.640
It's just another window of the same workbook.

25
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.060
OK,

26
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.680
but if we move to another workbook.

27
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.740
Okay,

28
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.910
Both of them get triggered.

29
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.150
So here the window deactivation message box gets triggered on.

30
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.130
Then the workbook deactivation message box gets triggered as well.

31
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.720
On this one year got trigger because we moved to another workbook.

32
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.350
OK,

33
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.390
so it's basically the window deactivate event.

34
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.450
Thank you very much watching this video I'll see on the next one.
