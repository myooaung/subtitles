00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
Okay,

2
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.560
guys.

3
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.700
So now we're going to speak about the workbook sheet.

4
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.490
Follow hyperlink event,

5
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.660
which actually gets triggered whenever you click on a hyperlink on any sheets in your

6
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.410
workbook.

7
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.690
Ok,

8
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.450
so this is similar to the follow hyperlink event on the worksheets in case of the worksheet

9
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.110
follow hyperlink event.

10
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.830
But it actually doesn't work on a particular worksheet.

11
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.150
It actually could work in any worksheet.

12
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.480
It's a global thing.

13
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.530
It's It works in on any sheets on your workbook.

14
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.280
OK,

15
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:37.660
Has got two parameters this h which is basically the sheet that he the hyperlink exists in

16
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.660
.

17
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.330
And the target which this the target is basically your hyperlink.

18
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.620
The type of the object is a hyperlink.

19
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.350
Okay,

20
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.740
so I could create a Harper link,

21
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.300
for example,

22
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.730
I'm on sheet to right now.

23
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.660
It could create a hyperlink to sheet six.

24
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.750
I'm going to right click here,

25
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.320
click on hyperlink,

26
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.680
and I'm gonna click on place in this document,

27
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.000
and I'm going to select sheet six.

28
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.380
So this is gonna I have a hyperlink linking to shoot six.

29
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.760
As you can see her in a click on it,

30
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:18.350
I go to shoot six so you could create a message box that says you are going to sheet six

31
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.120
and then from and then a space.

32
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.260
And then we close our double quotes and that an UN percent as h dot name.

33
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.510
So this should be triggered when we click on the hyperlink.

34
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.620
And it's going to say you're going to sheet six from sheet to because the hyperlink is in

35
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.200
sheet to and we refer to it using the S H parameter.

36
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.310
So when you click on the link here says you're going to shoot six from sheet to Okay,

37
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.670
so simply the follow hyperlink event.

38
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.980
It works the same way as in the sheet events.

39
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.360
Eso ah,

40
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.780
that's it.

41
00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.550
Thank you very much,

42
00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.770
guys,

43
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.050
