1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,350
Okay,

2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:00,610
guys.

3
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,320
So now we're gonna have an exercise for the work seat events.

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,990
So in this exercise year,

5
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,590
we've got this exercise worksheet,

6
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,350
and what I need you to do is to write an event procedure for this worksheet here called

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,770
Exercise to fill the entire row of a selected cell with the color vb red.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,130
And as a hint,

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,010
he will need to use the property called entire row for the range object.

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,040
So what this event is going to achieve is basically,

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,230
if you select a cell,

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,790
its entire row gets colored in rat.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,520
Okay,

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,790
so I need you to attempt that exercise.

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,530
And I do have the answer here for the exercise in this exercise answer module.

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:44,950
Of course,

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,560
you need to copy the code.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,170
If you want to try the answer,

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,840
you need to copy it and put it in the exercise worksheet and make it an event.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,060
So if you get stuck,

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,080
have a look at the answer.

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,360
And if you have any questions,

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,110
please leave them in the Q and a section off the course.

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,780
Thank you very much.

25
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,450
