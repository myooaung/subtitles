00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.220
Hey,

2
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.540
guys,

3
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.150
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.990
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.280
we're going to discuss the nested case statements.

6
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.060
So how to nesky statements inside each other and actually have the same idea as nested ifs

7
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.650
as well?

8
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.490
So we're gonna illustrate nesting case statements using a game here the I've created.

9
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.430
So basically,

10
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.450
this game is based on the fact that if you live in the northern Hemisphere or the northern

11
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.870
half of the Earth,

12
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.000
your winter is going to be in December,

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.180
January and February.

14
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.080
Your spring is gonna be in March,

15
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.150
April and May,

16
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.370
and your summer is gonna be in June,

17
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.260
July and August on your autumn will be in September,

18
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.970
October or November,

19
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.320
right?

20
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800
That's if you live in the Northern Hemisphere,

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.910
the northern half of the Earth,

22
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.860
like myself.

23
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.740
I live in Egypt,

24
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.510
for example.

25
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.760
And also,

26
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.360
if you live in the Southern Hemisphere or the southern half off the earth Like if you live

27
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.480
in Australia,

28
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.510
for example,

29
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.670
your summer is gonna be in December,

30
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.920
January and February.

31
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.320
Your autumn is gonna be in Marsh,

32
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350
April and May.

33
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.520
Your winter is gonna be in June,

34
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.390
July and August,

35
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.500
and your spring is gonna be in September October and November,

36
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.190
Right?

37
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.780
So here I've got some form.

38
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.330
It is year.

39
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.920
The are generating a random date and a reading them value for the hemisphere either north

40
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.710
or self.

41
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.500
And we're actually gonna have a macro here that has nested case statements Where,

42
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.510
as you can see here,

43
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.240
we get two variables at the beginning Variable called month in,

44
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.450
which is actually gonna hold the interviewer variable the month.

45
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.690
So is gonna get the month from the date.

46
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.090
Okay.

47
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.860
And this value is gonna be an integer like one or two or three or four,

48
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.060
depending on the month.

49
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.870
Okay.

50
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.000
And it's gonna have a maximum value of 12 off course.

51
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.180
And that's why we don't need to make the data type is an integer because the maximum value

52
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.700
we're going to get is a 12 and the bite can hold up to 255 and we'll get another variable

53
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.050
here called hemisphere.

54
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.540
Its stock is a string and is gonna hold the value of the hemisphere from Selby too.

55
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.200
So the month and is going to get the value of the month integer from sell a two by having

56
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.470
the month function applied to the date and the month function would produce the integer

57
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.650
value off the month.

58
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.760
And then we're gonna have a case statement here.

59
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.450
So let case hemisphere,

60
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.210
we're gonna test the value off the variable hemisphere.

61
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.870
If its value is north,

62
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.210
We're actually gonna nest another case statement in there.

63
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.220
So select case,

64
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.270
the value of month and so are going to do another test.

65
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.380
We're gonna nest another test inside the test for the hemisphere,

66
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.140
and we're gonna basically check for the value for the integer and display the message box

67
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.480
that corresponds to that month in the Northern Hemisphere on.

68
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.820
Of course,

69
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.390
if the values no North,

70
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.000
then we're gonna check on the South,

71
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.030
and it's gonna be either north or South.

72
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.730
So it's gonna go south here and then is going to test the value of the month and and

73
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.120
display the message box corresponding to the season of the year and notice here how I'm in

74
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.240
denting my case statements years to select case hemisphere.

75
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.320
And then I'm inventing the case north and then inventing again Select case month and I'm

76
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.620
inventing the code here for the sake of readability.

77
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.250
It doesn't have any effect on the execution of the code.

78
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.310
But it's just for readability to be able to read the code to understand that this case here

79
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.310
,

80
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.830
this test is gonna be inside the first select case and then the second select cases

81
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.360
actually,

82
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.080
inside this case test okay,

83
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.400
Just the same idea,

84
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.670
as in nested ifs were inventing our code for readability.

85
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.150
So currently,

86
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.750
we've got the date third of May 2016 and the hemisphere is north,

87
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.030
so that should produce the springs are gonna go through the courts,

88
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.150
step by step here.

89
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.050
First of all,

90
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.490
we're going to select our worksheet nested case statement that we're working on.

91
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.180
Okay,

92
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.840
so just we're making sure doesn't like the correct worksheet because we've got to work

93
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.060
sheets in this workbook,

94
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.820
and then we're gonna input the value for the month into here,

95
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.720
and we're going to get a five because we're in May and then the hemisphere.

96
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.950
We're going to get a north,

97
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.640
and then we're gonna test the value for hemisphere case north.

98
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.790
Is it north?

99
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.070
Yes,

100
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.580
it is.

101
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.560
So we're gonna go ahead and execute the nested case statement here,

102
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.000
that cases statement that is nested inside the first case statement and we're gonna do our

103
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.150
tests for the seasons and we're going to get spring.

104
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.910
And then So we've got spring,

105
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.860
we jump straight away to the end,

106
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.270
select.

107
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.820
And this end select is actually the UN select for this select case statement.

108
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.340
Okay,

109
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.010
This is why,

110
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.500
as you can see her there indented to the same level,

111
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.950
and this indicates that this and select is for this select case and you need to put an end

112
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.430
select for every select case or here because we've got one select case to select.

113
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.070
Case says three.

114
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.640
So we get three select case statements we need to have three corresponding and select.

115
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.910
So here's an and select.

116
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.420
Here's an UN select that closes this one here and here is that and select,

117
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.090
that closes the 1st 1 for the hemisphere.

118
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.100
Okay,

119
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.940
so it's the same idea as nesting if statements,

120
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.550
so in select and select.

121
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.070
Now these formulas actually produce random values.

122
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.010
Whenever the workbook recall,

123
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.720
Caday so can actually re calculate my workbook here.

124
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.980
Calculate now and we get a different value for self and for the date.

125
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.890
So if we do the test again here,

126
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.280
got it just right hemisphere case North.

127
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.610
No,

128
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.610
it's not north.

129
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.320
They're going to go south here,

130
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.480
and it's gonna be in April.

131
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:12.480
So that is gonna produce autumn and in select an answer like Okay,

132
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.720
So I hope you got the idea for the nested case statements.

133
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.200
Thank you very much for watching this video guys.

134
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.850
And I'll see on the next one.
