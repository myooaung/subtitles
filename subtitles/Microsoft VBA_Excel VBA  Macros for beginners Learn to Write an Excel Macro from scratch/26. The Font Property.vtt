00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.240
Hey,

2
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.570
guys,

3
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.200
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.110
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.900
we're going to speak about the range dot fund property.

6
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:13.560
So what the range dot fund property allows us to do is to actually change the aspects off

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.710
the fund for the range object So we can actually make the fund bolt or recon,

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.850
make it italics,

9
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.420
or we can make it underline.

10
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.700
And we can also change the funds size,

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.270
and we can change its color.

12
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.490
And also,

13
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.440
we can change.

14
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.160
It's fun types,

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.240
all these,

16
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.790
you know,

17
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.620
theme fund,

18
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.770
school ebri.

19
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.130
Ah,

20
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.040
aerial toe,

21
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.690
home on all these kinds of funds so we can control all that using the range start fund

22
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.650
property.

23
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.960
Okay,

24
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.250
so let's see how we can do that.

25
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.590
So I've got my named range that it's called my and a score table.

26
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.440
And if I write range,

27
00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.180
my underscore table dot font dot bold equals true.

28
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.700
Okay.

29
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.190
And if I run that you can see here that the fund has become bold.

30
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.840
Okay,

31
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.340
So what this go does is actually sets the bold property for the fund object.

32
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.600
The actually results from using the funds property to be equal to true.

33
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.060
So actually,

34
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.580
when you use the fund property yields a fund object and that fund object has a bold

35
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.160
property.

36
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.190
And you said that property equals two.

37
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.720
True,

38
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.910
You can also I,

39
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:39.410
tallis eyes a range So range underscore my table dot fund thought I talic equals true.

40
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.650
So that will actually I tell a size the fund as well.

41
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.250
And you can also set range that fund dot underline equals two.

42
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.880
True.

43
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.150
And if you run that this is actually gonna underlying your fund as well.

44
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.840
Okay,

45
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.320
so what if I need to reverse these changes so un bold the fund and on Ayatollah size it and

46
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.840
remove the line under it as well?

47
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.660
So actually said these properties to be equal to false.

48
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.500
So if I do that So this is equal to false and so bold equal to falls.

49
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.750
I thought it equal to false underline equal to false.

50
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.250
And if I run that So all the changes that I've made have been reversed.

51
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.240
Okay,

52
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.280
So let's see how we can do something else to our fund.

53
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.470
So,

54
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.190
for example,

55
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.560
we can also change the funds color.

56
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.150
So if you write range,

57
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:44.390
my underscore table dot fund dot color equals and actually you would need to either right

58
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.800
one of the V b a color constants which are basically some colors that you can write as

59
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.380
words.

60
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.020
Or you can actually write the exact shade of the color that you need using the RGB function

61
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.020
.

62
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.600
I'm gonna list.

63
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.100
Actually,

64
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.880
the XlV be a color constance on the screen for you,

65
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.110
but one of them is,

66
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.780
for example,

67
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.930
vb red.

68
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.600
So this is actually going to turn the color of the fund to be read.

69
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.360
However,

70
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.060
this is actually one shade of red there,

71
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.790
of course,

72
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.750
lots of shades of red.

73
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.060
And you can actually get any shade off color that you want using the RGB function and the

74
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.240
RGB function is basically a function that allows you to get any shade of color that you

75
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.820
want,

76
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.960
assuming that any color is basically a mix of red,

77
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.580
green and blue suit could write,

78
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:44.490
equals rgb and then start listing the shade of your color based on its RGB values.

79
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.060
Okay,

80
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.780
so I'll put a random color here,

81
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.340
for example,

82
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:55.530
RGB 1 50 5200 I don't even know what color that's gonna be turning out to be.

83
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.070
Well,

84
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.060
just run that and as you can see her,

85
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.600
it's a shade of purple.

86
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.200
OK,

87
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.600
so this is how you can get any color that you want,

88
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.850
the shade of any color that you want and actually something that you can do.

89
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.020
If you don't know what the RGB numbers off a certain color are,

90
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.920
you can actually Google that.

91
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.210
So,

92
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.250
for example,

93
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.600
you can Google on.

94
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.750
I'll just write that as a comment so that Excel wouldn't give me an error.

95
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.880
You can write,

96
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.480
for example,

97
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.520
the United States United States flag RGB colors,

98
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.590
for example.

99
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.680
You can just write that on Google,

100
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.210
and you will be able to get some search results having the RGB colors for the exact shades

101
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.210
of red and blue and white for the United States flag colors.

102
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.740
Okay,

103
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.730
so you can do that with anything you Congar ble anything instead of United States flag.

104
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.960
And just add the word RGB colors to it and just Google that you'll be able to get the RGB

105
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.620
colors off that particular object that you need to get the color off in order to plug it

106
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.050
into your RGB function and get the exact shade off colors that you want.

107
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:23.340
You can also change this size off your fund so you can write range my table dot font the

108
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.050
size.

109
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.000
I'll just copy that here.

110
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.050
The fund or size equals to 15 for example,

111
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.590
and this will change the phone sites.

112
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.370
If you run that,

113
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.900
you could see her.

114
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.780
There are funds got bigger.

115
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.390
You can also change the fun type or the fund name or,

116
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.800
you know,

117
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.020
make it one of these aerial and calibri and to home and older fund names so you can write

118
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:58.070
range my table dot font name equals and then put the front name between double quotes.

119
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.400
So equals Ariel,

120
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.230
for example.

121
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.930
So if you run that you consider the our fund changed something else that you can do to your

122
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.460
fund.

123
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.680
Okay,

124
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.920
guys.

125
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.930
So we've demonstrated a lot of examples here for the range dot funds property there are

126
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.360
actually other properties is also when you write range my table dot funds.

127
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.950
So I'll just copy that.

128
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.930
Don't fund and then you write another dot Here,

129
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.340
Excel suggests other properties for you.

130
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.300
There is the background color index.

131
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.640
You know there are other properties other than the ones that we've explained.

132
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.120
If you need to get information about any of these properties.

133
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.550
You can just google that.

134
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.170
Okay,

135
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.480
So,

136
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.450
for example,

137
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.470
if you,

138
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.830
Google will destroy that as a comment here ranged art fund dot color index,

139
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.660
for example.

140
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.950
And then you write the word MSD in which stands for Microsoft Directory Networks.

141
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:04.730
If you Google that you actually have your first result as the page on Microsoft directly

142
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.920
Neck Court network,

143
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.360
that explains that property.

144
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.190
Okay.

145
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.040
And if you go to that page,

146
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.590
you'll be able to no information about this particular property.

147
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.850
You can also highlight the property after writing in VB a on press F one on your keyboard

148
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:21.220
as well.

149
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.160
And that will take you to its page on Microsoft Directory Network.

150
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.260
On this course.

151
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.900
We're not gonna explain each and every property and method for each and every object.

152
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.330
You know,

153
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.420
we're just gonna list and explain the most important properties and methods and give you

154
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.490
examples And then,

155
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:43.750
from there on your able to learn about other properties and and methods of for the object,

156
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.790
bar yourself,

157
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.340
you know,

158
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.340
So it is very easy,

159
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.770
actually,

160
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.330
just Google that part or you just highlighted and press F one and you're able to get

161
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.170
information about the property,

162
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.240
arm or method,

163
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.520
and this course lays the foundation for you.

164
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:04.070
And the more important thing than acquiring information is actually to learn how to acquire

165
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.900
information.

166
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.330
You know,

167
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.870
that's more important than the information acquired is by itself.

168
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.320
Okay,

169
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.550
Hope you got my idea.

170
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.600
So thanks,

171
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:11.830
guys.

172
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.950
Watching this video I'll see on the next.
