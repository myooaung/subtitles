00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,210
Hey,

2
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,490
guys,

3
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,150
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,930
So in this video,

5
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,670
we're going to discuss to do until structure.

6
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,360
So I've got an example here,

7
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,830
and it's actually the same cold,

8
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,940
except that I've done it as do until loop instead of just a do loop,

9
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,000
a simple do loop.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,950
And here what we're going to do We're going to select cell a one and then we're just gonna

11
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,450
execute that code here,

12
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:26,850
which is to go one cell down until the value of the active cell is equal to 10.

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,040
As you can see here,

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,120
in column may have written some numbers year between one and 27.

15
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,090
And if we try to execute this code,

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,430
well,

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,850
first of all,

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,770
so that cell a one and then we're just gonna go one cell down until the value of the active

19
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,130
cell is equal to 10.

20
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,690
And then what happens when the value of the active cell is equal to 10?

21
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,220
We stop and we exit the loop and we go to the ends up statement.

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,790
And as you could notice here,

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:01,500
we actually check for the condition first before executing the code which is going one cell

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,000
down.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,140
So this is the do until structure.

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,300
If we switch that to a loop until structure and we try to execute that code.

27
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,190
So we're gonna sell Excel a one,

28
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,020
and then we're going to go down one cell and then check for the condition,

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,960
go down one cell,

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,850
check for the condition,

31
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,000
not check for the condition,

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,900
and then go down.

33
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,510
One sell.

34
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,710
Well,

35
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,970
guys,

36
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,300
this is the difference here.

37
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,440
So as you can see here,

38
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,620
we execute the code first,

39
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,470
and then we check for our condition.

40
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,160
And in some cases,

41
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,050
depending on the scenario and what you're doing,

42
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,310
the do until will be more efficient than the loop until okay,

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,790
but this of course,

44
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,480
depends on situation and what you're doing in your code and everything.

45
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,590
So that's a simple example for the do until loop.

46
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,590
Thank you very much.

47
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,650
Watching this video I'll see on the next one
