Hey,

2
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.560
guys,

3
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.060
welcome backs in this video.

4
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.250
We're going to discuss the dot formula property for the range object.

5
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.380
So what the dot formula property does is that it outputs the four Mina off the range object

6
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.680
that you use it on.

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.620
However,

8
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.760
it can only work with objects having single cells.

9
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.060
Okay,

10
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.880
so with range objects on lee having single cells so you could use it with range a one,

11
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.500
for example.

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.790
But it cannot work with range objects that are having multiple cells.

13
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.120
Right?

14
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.000
Because you cannot.

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.460
I'll put the formula of multiple cells at the same time,

16
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.970
so you can't use it on range.

17
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.700
A 12 d five,

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.480
for example.

19
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.770
Okay,

20
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.100
so the range object that you would use it with needs to have Onley just a single self.

21
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.880
Okay,

22
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.670
so to have an example here,

23
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.650
I've got a separate seizure that's cold range under school from another I've created and

24
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.100
remember,

25
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.390
guys,

26
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.850
we've got a named range called my underscore table that we have created before.

27
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.590
Okay,

28
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:11.360
so if I write on cell D 14 equals some my underscore table and I've actually popped the

29
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.310
value off done in each cell off the range called Molly underscore table.

30
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.410
And this range consists of 60 cells.

31
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.220
So summation should be 600.

32
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.150
Okay.

33
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:33.030
And if we go back to the visual basic environment and we would write range de $14 for media

34
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.030
,

35
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.750
okay?

36
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.040
And we put that inside a best itch box and we run that we will actually get a message,

37
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.450
boss,

38
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.130
containing the exact formula that we've written in cell D 14.

39
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.100
So if you run that you can see here we got the formula in cell D 14.

40
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.970
However,

41
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.300
if I do range d $14 value,

42
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.560
I would get actually the value that is in cell D 14 which is 600.

43
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.720
Okay,

44
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.450
so you're able to retrieve the formula of a cell or from a cell using the range dot form it

45
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.350
up property.

46
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.140
However,

47
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.510
you're also able to write the formula in a cell so you can write a certain formula in a

48
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.410
cell using the range taht formula property.

49
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.020
So let's say I'm going to write this scene formula here,

50
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.030
but using v b A.

51
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.820
So I'm gonna delete it from Cell D 14 and then I'm gonna write range d 14 dot for media

52
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.880
equals and then I actually need to right the exact formula,

53
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.280
but between double quotes,

54
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.710
so equals some of my underscore table between double quotes.

55
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.420
So if I run that this is going to write the formula and we're going to get the result,

56
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.590
which is 600 the same result,

57
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.730
you could also use the dot value property as well.

58
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.280
And that is going to write the formula correctly as well.

59
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.850
So if I delete that,

60
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.570
go back and use the value property this as well,

61
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.420
we're right deformity correctly,

62
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.870
and everything is just gonna be fine.

63
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.960
And this formula,

64
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.410
of course,

65
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.880
works.

66
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.900
And it updates if we just change the value of one of the cells,

67
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.760
you can see here that the formula updates.

68
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.820
I'm just gonna press control and Z here.

69
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.460
Okay,

70
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.060
so that's it,

71
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.280
guys for the dot formula property.

72
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.280
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see on the next one
