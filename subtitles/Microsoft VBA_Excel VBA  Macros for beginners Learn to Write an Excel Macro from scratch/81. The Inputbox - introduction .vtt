00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.350
Hey,

2
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.650
guys,

3
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.290
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.490
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.730
we're going to speak about another way to interact with users,

6
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.840
which is using the input box.

7
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.280
So the input box is a function that enables us to display a dialog box that prompts the

8
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.340
user to enter some information and then we can capture the information entered by the user

9
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.900
and do stuff with it.

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.550
So let's have a look of the anatomy of an input box.

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.630
It consists mainly of a title,

12
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.500
and the title is basically your title,

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.600
just like in the message box.

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.860
And there is the prompt.

15
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.150
The problem is basically the main message or the main question that you would ask the user

16
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.980
so as to input some information based on that question.

17
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.630
And then there is also the default value,

18
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.650
and the default value is a value that you can enter as part of the arguments of the input

19
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.010
box function size to be displayed by default.

20
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.550
And if the user does not,

21
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.250
it it.

22
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.050
This field and press is okay,

23
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.970
then this is the value we're gonna capture,

24
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.030
and we can use it as well to guide the user on what the user should do.

25
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380
So let's look at the arguments as well for the input box.

26
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.230
So the input box has six arguments,

27
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.190
but two of them are actually obsolete,

28
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.850
which are the health file in the context,

29
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.560
so we're not going to speak about them.

30
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.580
We've got the problem.

31
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.280
The title,

32
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.960
the default expose and Wipo's.

33
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.760
The Prompt is the only mandatory argument for the input box,

34
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.170
and the other arguments are all optional.

35
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.920
So we know about the prompt in the title because we've seen them on the message box and

36
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.020
they actually performed the same task.

37
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.060
The default value,

38
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.770
as I told you,

39
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.550
is the value that is going to appear here in the field.

40
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.110
These should enter data in it will appear by default so you can use it,

41
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.790
for example,

42
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.750
to have a default value.

43
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.540
So as when you ask the user about his gender,

44
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.660
what is your gender?

45
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.180
You could have a default value of male,

46
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.020
for example,

47
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.090
and then here it's going to display male as the default value.

48
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.040
If the user does not edit that I am just clicks,

49
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.580
OK,

50
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.840
then we're gonna capture male and also if last the user what age your name you can use it

51
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.600
in another way.

52
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.470
The default value.

53
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.000
You can use it in another way,

54
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.170
which is to guide the user on what to do.

55
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.210
So here we're asking the user about his name.

56
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.910
You can make the default value as please enter your name here.

57
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.780
So this way you're kind of guiding the user on what to do,

58
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.300
and this will be displayed on the message box by default.

59
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.420
There are also two other values,

60
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.930
which are the Expos and the WIPO's and the Expos in the WIPO's represent the distance

61
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.280
between the left edge of the input box and the left edge of the screen,

62
00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.730
and also the top edge of the input box and the top edge of the screen.

63
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:10.010
And this is measured in trips and want to whip is equal to 1/14 40 of an inch.

64
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.550
Now,

65
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.620
if you do not enter a value for the Expos and for the WIPO's,

66
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.350
your input box will be positioned in the middle off the screen,

67
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.830
which is probably what you would want to do anyways.

68
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.420
Okay,

69
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.720
guys.

70
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.810
So this was a quick introduction about the input box in the upcoming videos.

71
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.280
We're gonna have some examples,

72
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.820
and we're going to see how to work with it.

73
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.950
So thanks for watching this video I'll see on the next one.
