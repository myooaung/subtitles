Hey,

2
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.530
guys,

3
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.170
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.320
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.990
we're going to speak about the difference between recording macros and writing VB a coat.

6
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.040
So when you run a recorded macro Excel just repeats the steps you recorded exactly as

7
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.980
you've recorded them.

8
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.560
So you record some steps and excel will just repeat them exactly as they have been recorded

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.560
.

10
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.580
However,

11
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.280
when you write VB a code,

12
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.230
you get much more power and it enables more functionality on your code so you can make

13
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.680
decisions and repeat actions and much more So recording macros has limited functionality

14
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.660
and writing code opens a world of possibilities.

15
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.830
And this is what we're gonna learn on this course.

16
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.550
We're gonna learn mainly how to write vb a coat.

17
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.020
So let's have an example here.

18
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.090
Let's say we have this stable here,

19
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.860
having some sales persons and their commissions so you can see here We've got some sales

20
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.380
persons and the commission of each sales person,

21
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.460
so I could record a macro too bold the names of the sales persons.

22
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.450
Okay,

23
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.880
So as you can see air,

24
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.460
I could record a macro to just build the names of all sales persons,

25
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.340
and you can see her.

26
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.610
The names have been bold ID,

27
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.750
however,

28
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.490
in order to have a macro bold the name of a sales person on Lee.

29
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.350
If their commission is greater than $10,000 this cannot be done by recording.

30
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.150
So is absolutely impossible to record a macro that can make a decision to bulled the name

31
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.880
based on the commission.

32
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.560
If it's more than $10,000 However,

33
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.580
this can be easily achieved when I write VB a code or when I write my Mac Rose.

34
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.110
So this very simple case can show you that writing VB a code is much more powerful than

35
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.900
recording macros.

36
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.140
So someone could ask,

37
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.840
Why would we have the option than to record Micro's?

38
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.800
So why did Microsoft include the option?

39
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.350
If it's just better to write VB a code?

40
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.270
Well,

41
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.180
there are a couple of reasons for that.

42
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.080
The 1st 1 is that someone might not be able to write VB a code.

43
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.800
He didn't have the skill to do so,

44
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.620
and he might be wanting to do a task that is fairly simple,

45
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.640
so he can just record that macro and just play whenever he wants to achieve that task.

46
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.820
And the second thing is that sometimes you may want to write a macro to do something.

47
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.750
However,

48
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.010
you do not know the method or property for that thing that you want to do.

49
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.850
So you don't know the property to change or the method that would enable you to do that.

50
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.600
And we will speak about methods and properties later on in the course.

51
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.100
But you basically don't know what co two,

52
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.440
right.

53
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.160
So you could record the action in order to know what piece of code to write and then take

54
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.790
it from there and start writing your macro.

55
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.770
And this is a very common way to learn about something that you do not know how to do in

56
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.800
Excel v b A.

57
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.150
So you just record it.

58
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.560
No,

59
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.730
the method or property that you need to use and just take it from there.

60
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.100
Start writing your coat.

61
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.920
OK,

62
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.320
so this was a quick overview about the difference between recording macros and writing VB a

63
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.770
code.

64
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.560
Thank you very much,

65
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.150
guys watching this video and I'll see you on the next one
