1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
Okay,

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:00,800
guys.

3
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,850
So now we're going to discuss the workbook after save event so you can get the workbook

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,710
after save event by going to your ah vb a editor and then double clicking on this workbook

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:21,060
here and then selecting work burke from this menu and selecting after save from this menu.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,620
So the workbook after save event triggers any code that you right after saving and to be

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,750
more specific,

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,880
it's actually after attempting to save.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,220
And that means that it gets triggered whether the save was successful or whether it's was

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,450
unsuccessful.

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,350
Okay,

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,780
so you can actually use it in combination with the before save or actually this is what

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,430
we're gonna do on this example.

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,140
So we've hade the before save event.

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,240
We've had the example where you ask a user toe under his name and the name is entered.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,050
Any presses control and s and tries to save the workbook.

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,160
If the name is entered,

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,760
then the workbook is gonna be saved.

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,860
If the cell is blank,

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,560
any presence controlling s he's going to get this message box here cannot save please under

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,120
your name.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,220
So we're gonna actually use the workbook after save event.

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,440
and we're gonna have a message box that says Save Waas.

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,230
We're gonna have a space after walls and we're gonna come Contin eight that with the

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:30,870
parameter here in the workbook after save even this cold success And this parameter here

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,480
success takes two values either two or false.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,120
If the save was done successfully,

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,160
that is gonna have a value of true.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:48,150
If the save was not done it to say it does not go through and look does not get saved,

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,640
then it's gonna have a value off fulls.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,260
Okay,

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:58,150
so what's gonna happen here is that we're gonna try to see the workbook.

33
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,210
Okay,

34
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,230
I'm going to try to save it control and s here.

35
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,370
This cell is blank.

36
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,260
There's no name.

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,820
Enter.

38
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,490
This is why the work before save event displays this message box it says cannot save.

39
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,160
Please enter your name and to prove that actually,

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,910
it will run.

41
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,400
I mean,

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,250
the after save event will run even if you're save was unsuccessful.

43
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,700
I'm gonna click OK here.

44
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,290
And you're going to see the message box here.

45
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,250
This message boxes the one triggered by the after save event and he says save waas false

46
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,780
okay,

47
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,660
Because the value of the parameter that is called success was false.

48
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,350
This is why he displays save waas False If I enter my name or really anything in this cell

49
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,550
impressed control and s again.

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,140
He says save was true.

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,150
And the first message bought message box.

52
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,470
The first message box that was for the before save event was not triggered because there

53
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,420
was a name entered.

54
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,670
Okay,

55
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,440
because the if statement does not trigger the message box unless the cell is empty.

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,360
OK,

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,890
so as you can see here,

58
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:13,940
it tests if the cell range B one the Selby one is blank than council equals true,

59
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,280
Which means that the workbook is not going to be saying and the message box appears,

60
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,650
But otherwise the message box will not appear.

61
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,580
Okay,

62
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,210
so basically,

63
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,300
the workbook after save event gets triggered whenever you actually attempt to save a

64
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,210
workbook and whether the save was successful or not.

65
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:42,860
Whatever code you put in here on the workbook after save event will get triggered.

66
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,570
Okay,

67
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,890
so I hope that was informative for you.

68
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,950
Thank you very much watching this video I'll see on the next one
