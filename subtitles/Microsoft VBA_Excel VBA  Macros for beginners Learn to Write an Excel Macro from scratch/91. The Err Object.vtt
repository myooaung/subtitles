00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
Hagos,

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.210
welcome back.

3
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.520
So in this video,

4
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.300
we're going to discuss the air object,

5
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:12.760
and the air object is spelled E r R allows us to know what our has been generated in our

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.540
procedure.

7
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.960
Okay?

8
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.640
And it allows us to know information about that error.

9
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.330
So what?

10
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.260
The area number is what the description is so that we can do different error handling based

11
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.990
on the type of error that I have faced in my procedure.

12
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.610
So let's have an example here.

13
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.190
I've got this procedure here,

14
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.310
and I've got two statements that are going to generate errors because the 1st 1 here works

15
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.310
.

16
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.670
It's my work she does Select is going to select the work shed A is called My worksheet,

17
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.560
which is actually not available in my workbook at the moment of deleted it.

18
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.800
So this one is gonna generate an air.

19
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.570
And also,

20
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.430
the second statement is a division by zero.

21
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.640
So it's going to generate an error as well.

22
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.590
So let's run this procedure here step by step.

23
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.170
So the first statement is going to generate an error.

24
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.920
Runtime error number nine.

25
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.210
Okay,

26
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.100
so the er number is nine.

27
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
I'm gonna comment the first statement okay,

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.020
so that we do not run it and I'm gonna run on procedures.

29
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.380
And only the second statement is gonna be run here,

30
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260
which is the division by zero.

31
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.510
I know.

32
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.050
This year that is runtime Aaron.

33
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.750
Number 11.

34
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.100
So the air number is 11 here.

35
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.810
Okay,

36
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.150
So I'm just gonna remind myself that this error is nine,

37
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.660
and this one is error number 11.

38
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.240
Okay,

39
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.630
so I put reminders you're just for myself,

40
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.120
not to forgot.

41
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:42.810
And now what I'm gonna do is that I'm gonna create here a go to label zone,

42
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.730
are go to,

43
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.380
for example,

44
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.120
air handling.

45
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.020
And then I'm gonna create a label here,

46
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.300
cold air handling.

47
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.960
And now we're gonna test for the air number that's been generated.

48
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.580
So if peridot number is equal to nine,

49
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.320
then message box worksheet.

50
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.960
Cold boy work.

51
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020
She does not exist.

52
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.530
Please create.

53
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.240
It s So this is the air message that's gonna appear if the heiress tested to be the one

54
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.050
here for selecting the worksheet that school money worksheet while actually does not exist

55
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.790
and notice here how I put the my worksheet ward here between two pairs of double quotes.

56
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.170
Because this is how you're gonna make the word my worksheet appear between two double

57
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.730
quotes while actually being inside a string.

58
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.950
So being between double quotes as well,

59
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.900
when you see that you understand it else.

60
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.740
If error dot number is equal to 11 then so in this case,

61
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.330
we have the divide by zero error.

62
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.830
Division by zero error message box.

63
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.420
You cannot divide by zero and then and if Okay,

64
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.130
so now we're gonna run our procedure.

65
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.870
So here we have on our go to air handling.

66
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.290
So this is gonna take us to the label called Air Handling And then this first statement

67
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.930
here worksheets.

68
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.370
My work,

69
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.380
she does it's gonna generate an error.

70
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.090
So they were going to jump to the air handling part here,

71
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.580
and we're gonna test for the error number,

72
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.590
and it's gonna be nine.

73
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.120
So we're gonna have this message box where she called Molly work.

74
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.180
She does not exist.

75
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.750
Police created and nose is here.

76
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.250
Why?

77
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.230
I put the mic worksheet between two pairs of double quotes because they wanted it to appear

78
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.810
between double course this way.

79
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.940
This is how you can make a word appear between double quotes when you put it in a message

80
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.130
box or put it in a string which should have to double quotes,

81
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.460
you know,

82
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.060
on its sights like that.

83
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.440
And we're gonna press OK,

84
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.050
and then we're gonna end the if statement and end sub.

85
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.750
So with tested the air because the air that's been tested or the area the first era that's

86
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.860
been captured here is the air for the selection of my worksheet.

87
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.320
While it does not exist,

88
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.550
we actually executed this one.

89
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.710
Okay,

90
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.170
we can actually comment this part here.

91
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.650
And if we run this statement again on our go to air handling and then range a wonder values

92
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.010
equal to one divided by zero.

93
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.530
So this way,

94
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.700
this one is going to generate an error,

95
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.010
which is the air for division by zero.

96
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.310
And we're gonna go to the air handling label here.

97
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.200
And when we run,

98
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.010
the if statement,

99
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.330
the 1st 1 is gonna be fools.

100
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.570
But the 2nd 1 is going to be true because the air number is gonna be 11 on.

101
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.270
We're gonna have a message box appear you cannot divide by zero,

102
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.990
and if and then we're gonna and the procedure.

103
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.230
So the err object or the air objects.

104
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.100
What it does is that it tests for the area numbers.

105
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.510
So this way you can generate a user friendly message,

106
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.540
for example that would tell the user what the air is because you're testing for its number

107
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.250
and each error in Excel Levy A.

108
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.780
Each one time heir has a unique error number.

109
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.680
So this way you can test for errors and generate user from the message boxes or take any

110
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.850
other actions that you would like based on that.

111
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:16.000
Another useful property for the air object is the air descriptions of the air dot

112
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.280
description property.

113
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.420
So what that does is that it gives you the description of the error.

114
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.680
Okay,

115
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.570
so get the same procedure here and have just generated a different message box here for

116
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.370
each error,

117
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.130
and it says air and then the pound sign or the hashtag sign and then concoct in eating that

118
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.960
onto the error number and then another concatenation onto a colon and then,

119
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.440
you know,

120
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.160
having a new line and then the er description.

121
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.000
So that's ah,

122
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.480
run that procedures to the first part here.

123
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.290
The first line of code here works in my work.

124
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.790
She does like this one is gonna generate an error,

125
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.280
and we're gonna jump.

126
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.510
We're gonna test for the air number is going to be nines.

127
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.900
We're gonna I have a message box appear here,

128
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.290
Erin Number nine subscript out of range.

129
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.590
And and if so now we're gonna end or procedure.

130
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.950
And then we can actually comment that line of code here,

131
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.250
and then we can run it again.

132
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.590
And the 2nd 1 is gonna create an error we're going to test for.

133
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.270
For the if statement,

134
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.500
we're gonna have this one to be true.

135
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.230
And then we're gonna have another message box here using the air Didot description property

136
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.440
year.

137
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.430
So I'm just using the air disc description to extract the description of the area.

138
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.200
And this is just the official description off the error that would appear if you encounter

139
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.710
the air.

140
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.830
So I'm just here telling you that you can use the air dot description here too,

141
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.440
including your message box.

142
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.940
And maybe you can ADM or description of your own or something.

143
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.540
Okay,

144
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.640
so the air dot description gives you the official description off the air.

145
00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.320
I'll be also including and excel vb a one time Archie cheat in the resource is section for

146
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.170
this lesson.

147
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.080
And this Geechee includes all the V B A one time errors,

148
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:14.630
the codes and the message is that you should get so as to have that with you as a resource

149
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.630
.

150
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.040
OK,

151
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.270
so thanks for watching this video on else you on the next one.
