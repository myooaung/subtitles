00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.150
Hey,

2
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.430
guys,

3
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.090
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.090
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.020
we're going to discuss the workbook window.

6
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.320
Activate event.

7
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.050
So the workbook window activate event.

8
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.810
What it does is that it triggers any code or it executes any code.

9
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.650
When you activate a window on your workbook on it actually should be a window on the

10
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.550
workbook that this event is in.

11
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.700
So it should be on the workbook called workbook events,

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.630
for example.

13
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.450
Okay.

14
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.750
And actually,

15
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.930
to be able to understand this event better,

16
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.580
we need to actually put it in comparison with the workbook.

17
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.600
Activate event.

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.320
This is why I've got the workbook.

19
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.980
Activate event here is well,

20
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.500
okay,

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.050
and I've got a message box on it.

22
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.450
Here.

23
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750
You have activated the workbook,

24
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.400
so this message box will be triggered when we actually do something that triggers the

25
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.810
workbook.

26
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.640
Activate event.

27
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.850
So,

28
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.250
actually,

29
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.520
I need to put the two events in comparison for you to be able to understand the difference

30
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.380
and to be able to eventually understand what the window activate event is.

31
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.530
And also to be able to understand the window activate event,

32
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.220
we need to create a new window.

33
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.470
So I'm going to do that.

34
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.160
Okay,

35
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.450
so I'm gonna go to the view top here on the ribbon and click on New Window.

36
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.580
And I've created a new window for the workbook Cold War book events.

37
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.030
And when you create a new window,

38
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.810
you basically have another window or view on the workbook.

39
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.150
OK,

40
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.000
maybe you want to have to work sheets visible at the same time.

41
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.310
Okay,

42
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.350
so you can see here.

43
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.660
Workbook events ones.

44
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.350
This is the first window workbook events too.

45
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.860
This is the second window on the 1st 1 I've got sheets six selected.

46
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.520
And on the 2nd 1 I've got sheet to selected.

47
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.960
So it's just another window.

48
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.440
Another perspective that enables you to look at the workbook,

49
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.900
you know,

50
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.270
at something else on the workbook.

51
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.100
So you can see to work sheets at the same time,

52
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.340
you know?

53
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.050
So this is,

54
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.450
you know,

55
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.860
one of the applications off creating a new window.

56
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.520
Okay,

57
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.470
So what I'm gonna do,

58
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.120
actually,

59
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.150
I'm gonna go to my event here.

60
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.530
Of course,

61
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.620
you can get it by double clicking on this workbook.

62
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.870
Selecting workbook on this menu and selecting window activate from this man.

63
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.080
You are believe we've done that.

64
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.620
Ah,

65
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.250
lot here on the course so far.

66
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.130
And I'm going to write a message box.

67
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.550
You have activated the window,

68
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.570
and I'm gonna add also with sheet.

69
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.290
Okay,

70
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.590
I'm gonna put a space here.

71
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.050
I'm gonna close my double quotes,

72
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.060
and I'm gonna can contine eight on that.

73
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.960
You can see here there is a parameter called W,

74
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.350
and and WN basically refers to the window that's just been activated.

75
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.220
So I'm gonna write WN dot and actually,

76
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.550
it has a property called the active sheets.

77
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.290
Okay.

78
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.700
And the active sheet is basically the sheep that is active on that window.

79
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.170
Dark name.

80
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.860
And I'm gonna canton eight that on.

81
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.380
Ah,

82
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.550
the word active.

83
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.360
Okay,

84
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.460
So it's going to say you have activated the window with sheet and it's gonna tell you what

85
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.490
the sheet name is,

86
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.680
and then the word active.

87
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.340
Okay,

88
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.580
so let's start examining the difference between the workbook activate event and the window

89
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.580
.

90
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.400
Activate event the workbook window.

91
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.180
Activate event.

92
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.700
So I'm also here.

93
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.990
Actually,

94
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.130
you consider that the event has been triggered.

95
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.660
Okay,

96
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.750
this is the window activate event.

97
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.500
Okay.

98
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.880
I'm also going to create a new workbook here by President Control and all my on my keyboard

99
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.770
and Now This isn't you Work but called book for now.

100
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.780
If you go to any window on our workbook events Workbook,

101
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.130
you can see here you have activated the workbooks.

102
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.790
This is the workbook.

103
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.840
Activate event triggered here.

104
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.290
And also you have activated the window with sheet sheet.

105
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.480
Six active.

106
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.100
Okay,

107
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.150
so this is the workbook window.

108
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.020
Activate event.

109
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.800
So you can see here when we go from another workbook to our workbook that has even event

110
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.720
written on it.

111
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.180
It will trigger both the workbook activate event and the window.

112
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.300
Activate event.

113
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.950
Okay.

114
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.430
However,

115
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.790
if we move from one window on our workbook to another window on this same workbooks because

116
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.450
here workbook for more book events.

117
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.670
One,

118
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.840
this is one window to workbook events to this is another window.

119
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.340
So as you can see here,

120
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.880
you have activated the window with the sheet sheet too active.

121
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.080
So this is on Lee the window.

122
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.290
Activate event triggered.

123
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.720
Okay,

124
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.440
you can see here there is no other message box triggered.

125
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.580
So we've moved from one window on the same work,

126
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.310
but to another window on the same workbook,

127
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.950
and that only triggered the window.

128
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.300
Activate event.

129
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.500
Okay,

130
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.190
so that's the difference when you come from one workbook back to another.

131
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.950
Workbook is gonna sugar both the window activate and the workbook activate.

132
00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.650
But when you go from one window on one workbook to another window on the same workbook,

133
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.360
there's only gonna trigger the window.

134
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.580
Activate event.

135
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.360
Okay,

136
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.020
so I hope that was clear for you.

137
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.800
Okay,

138
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.680
so that's it.

139
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.240
Basically for the window.

140
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.460
Activate event.

141
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.180
Of course,

142
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.480
you can run any code that you right in there by triggering the event.

143
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.480
When you do what triggers the event,

144
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.950
which is actually moving from one window to another.

145
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.970
And I typically don't use it a lot.

146
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.270
But if there is something that this event will prove useful for for yourself,

147
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.160
I would be interested to know it.

148
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.580
Okay.

149
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.510
Thank you very much watching this video I'll see on the next one.
