1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
and this video,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,250
we're going to learn how to deal with workbooks.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:05,890
So,

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,710
basically,

5
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,980
to deal with workbooks,

6
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,730
you need to call the name of the workbook from the workbooks collection,

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,070
just like we were doing so with sheets when we were calling the name of the sheet from the

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,510
sheets collection over the worksheets collection.

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,270
So to do that,

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:28,550
you just write workbooks and then you open brackets and then between double quotes,

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,900
right,

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,840
the name of the workbook.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,490
So let's say I'm going to deal with the workbook,

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,640
that it's cooled my workbook here that I have got open at the moment and you actually then

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,310
need to write the extension as well and then close double quotes and then close parentheses

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,100
and then dot and use whichever method or property would like to use here.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,930
I'm going to use the activate method,

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,150
which actually activates the workbook.

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,240
Please note that not writing the extension can sometimes work,

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,840
but in other occasions,

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,430
actually,

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,850
it can give you an error.

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,990
So it is better actually that you write the extension for the workbook.

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,850
And when we actually get the name of the workbook and a message box in a few moments you're

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,150
going to see the AXITY.

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,150
The extension is part of the name of the workbook,

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,010
so it is actually an essential part,

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,600
and you need to write it.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,300
So now if I run this macro,

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,680
no noticeable change is gonna happen because the workbook that is called my workbook is

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
already activated.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,060
However,

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,000
there is another workbook that I've got open as well.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
They schooled other workbook.

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,450
So if I write other workbook here has enabled the workbook that I need to activate on I run

36
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,320
the macro because here that other workbook has been activated.

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,800
Another way to deal with workbooks is using the active workbook statement.

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,880
So the active workbook statement basically refers to the workbook that is currently active

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:56,880
.

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,060
So,

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,670
for example,

42
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,350
currently,

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,000
the active workbook is called other workbook.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,540
So I say I'm gonna write active workbook dot name,

45
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,750
and I'm gonna have that in a message box.

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,060
So we're gonna have a message box pop up with the name of the active workbook,

47
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,550
and I'm actually gonna comment the first line of code as well,

48
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,750
so as not to be executed.

49
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,650
And if you run this macro,

50
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,310
you're gonna have the name of the active workbook in a message box.

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,090
And as you can see here,

52
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,820
the extension is part of the name.

53
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,170
Okay,

54
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,470
so make sure that you write the extension when you write the name of the workbook.

55
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,270
Another way to deal with workbooks is actually using that this workbook statement.

56
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,900
So this work booked our name,

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,530
for example,

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,510
will give you the name of the workbook that has the macro written in it.

59
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,950
So it's not the active one is actually the one that has the macro written in it.

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,100
So currently,

61
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,140
this macro is written in module One in the workbook that is called Molly Workbook.

62
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,260
So when we get the name of the workbook using this workbook statement,

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,300
we will actually get my work.

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,650
But because this is the workbook that has the macro written in it.

65
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,890
So now I have commented this line of code the second line of code,

66
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,130
and I'm gonna run this macro,

67
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,130
and we get the name of the workbook that the macro is written in.

68
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,880
And please note as well that you cannot activate a workbook unless it's open.

69
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,210
So if the workbook is not open already than you need to open it first by using the dot open

70
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,710
method,

71
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,400
which we will discuss in a future lesson.

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,860
Okay,

73
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,120
guys,

74
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,080
to this was an introduction on how to deal with workbooks and the upcoming lessons.

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,960
We're going to learn more about workbooks.

76
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,830
Thank you very much for watching this video,

77
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,150
and I'll see you on the next one.
