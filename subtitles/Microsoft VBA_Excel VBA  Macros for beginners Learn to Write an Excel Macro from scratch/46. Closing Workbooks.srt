00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,230
in this video,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,550
we're going to discuss the work picked out clothes method and the work picked up.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,050
Close method allows us to close a workbook.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,090
So I've got a workbook here called Closing Workbooks.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,500
And if I want to close this workbook a dry,

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,240
active work booked up close,

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,620
I could also write this work booked up close.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,870
And it could also write the name of the workbook using the workbooks collection side right

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:25,870
,

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,600
workbooks,

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,830
closing workbooks,

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,050
dark clothes.

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,100
So if I run this code,

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,480
you can see her that I get prompted on whether it would like to save my teen years or not,

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,890
which is actually the normal thing.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,110
That happens when you make changes to a workbook and you're trying to close it.

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,480
Excel will prompt you on whether you'd like to save the changes or not.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,510
I'm not going to see the changes for now.

19
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,820
I'm gonna press cancel and actually the workbook dot close method has some parameters

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,700
actually were only going to discuss the safe changes in the file name because the root

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,850
workbook parameter is actually an obsolete parameter that was being used until office 97 on

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,070
Lee,

23
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,150
there are only gun,

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:11,110
Discuss the safe changes and the file name the safe changes parameter allows you to either

25
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,350
save the changes that you've done or not.

26
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,990
So if you put that equals true than be changes air going to be saved and you're not gonna

27
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,140
be prompted on whether you would like to see the changes or not.

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,750
So the workbook will be closed and your changes will be safe.

29
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,650
If you put it equal to false,

30
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,040
then the workbook will be closed without saving the changes.

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,750
Okay.

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,520
And there is another one here that it's called the file name,

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,860
and this allows you to basically say the workbook to a certain destination.

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,950
So I'm going to say that actually to I test folder on my desktop.

35
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,870
Okay,

36
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,320
so there is a folder on my desktop called Test folder.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,010
I'm going to save it with the name tested excellence em on that folder.

38
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,210
So you need to actually write the complete path and include,

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,790
as well the name of the file that you need to save it with.

40
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,100
Okay,

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,820
says this access a save,

42
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,560
as basically you're saving it as a certain name in a certain location and actually in order

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,210
to do that.

44
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,650
Of course,

45
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,250
you need to have the safe changes to be equal to Troop,

46
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,180
right,

47
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,640
cause you cannot ask Excel to not say the changes and at the same time,

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,200
savior in a certain location.

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,520
So if you run this macro,

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,380
what's gonna happen is that this Excel file will be closed.

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,960
And it's gonna be also saved as this name in the location that I've specified.

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,890
So to run that we consider that the Excel file husband closed.

53
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,170
And if I go here to my test folder,

54
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,250
you can see her that there is the test file that I saved.

55
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,320
Okay,

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,570
guys.

57
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,200
So I have actually reopened my file now,

58
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,370
and I would just like to tell you that doing a save as using the clothes method is not the

59
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,000
recommended way of doing it.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,070
It is actually more recommended that you would do it using the dart save as method,

61
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,360
which we're going to discuss in an upcoming lesson.

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,110
So ah,

63
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,680
thank you guys for watching this video and I'll see on the next one
