Okay,

8
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.670
so I'm gonna click create a hyperlink.

9
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.240
Okay.

10
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.410
I'm just going to write,

11
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.480
http.

12
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.350

14
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.280
Okay?

15
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.840
And this is a hyper link.

16
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.610
If you click on it,

17
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.580
you're gonna go to google dot com.

18
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.210
Okay,

19
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.150
so let's check that event.

20
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.950
So I'm just going to right click here on my follow hyperlink worksheet,

21
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.170
click on view code and then click on worksheet.

22
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.310
And then we're gonna click here on follow hyperlink.

23
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.410
I'm just going to remove here the selection change event because we don't need it.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.640
And then I'm just gonna have a message box.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.690
then an m percent.

29
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.790
Because here there is a target parameter,

30
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.700
So the target refers to the hyperlink.

31
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.370
It's a hyperlink object.

32
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.760
Okay,

33
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.820
not a range object.
