1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,930
Okay,

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,890
So in this lecture,

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,840
we're going to see how we can put a text in a cell using V B A and the range object.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,500
Basically.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,830
So I've created another macro here and ah,

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,480
name that.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,430
My underscore texts.

8
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,230
And that's Ah,

9
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,550
away,

10
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:15,920
actually,

11
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,270
two separate different words and on a macro is name because you can't put a space between

12
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,130
two words,

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,850
but you can put an underscore,

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,360
but you can do a dash.

15
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:27,800
Actually,

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,660
an actual give you on errors.

17
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,850
If we try that my dash tax,

18
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,560
it will give give you an error.

19
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,080
So,

20
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,660
actually,

21
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,700
if you need to separate the two words,

22
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,610
you can put an underscore between them.

23
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,560
Okay,

24
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,810
so let's say you want to put my name as a text in cell A one.

25
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,770
Okay,

26
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,710
so Britain money name here.

27
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:56,880
And then I'm gonna run this macro so it writes my name into the cell and you can see her

28
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,990
that I put my name between double quotes.

29
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,640
So that's kind of a rule in V B.

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:01,850
A.

31
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,190
If you need to write text,

32
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,060
it needs to be between double quotes,

33
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,170
because this is considered basically a string,

34
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,730
and we'll talk about the V b A data types later on.

35
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,910
But this is a string.

36
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:21,500
A text on a text needs to be put between double quotes.

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,250
So thank you guys for watching this lecture and please follow me onto the next one.
