00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.410
Okay,

2
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.310
so continuing our employee database.

3
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.110
Example.

4
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.910
What if the computer that is running this macro has its state format as the US format?

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.400
So if this is the case and we have our eye be date variable declared as a date than

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.350
entering the date as the international format would not yield the expected result.

7
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.340
Because if the computers date is in the U.

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.910
S format than Excel will abide to the computers,

9
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.650
they form it.

10
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.390
So it's gonna help put the date in the American format.

11
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.850
So if you enter the 10th of May,

12
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.550
it will be outfitted as the fifth of October,

13
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.340
for example.

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.840
So our goal here is to solve that problem and make sure that we get consistent results no

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.120
matter what the date format on the computer that the macro is running on is so if the

16
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.490
computer has a state for Mitt as the international foreman or the US format,

17
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.030
we would still get this same result.

18
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.740
So let's see how we can solve that problem.

19
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.350
OK,

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.060
so I copied my macro here,

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.910
renamed as date format and did some changes to it.

22
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.500
Now I created a variable called S T.

23
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.820
R.

24
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.980
I b underscore hiring date and made its type as a string.

25
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.390
And basically this variable is gonna host the user's input on the input box for the

26
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.010
employees hiring date instead of the variable that was cold.

27
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.350
I be hiring date,

28
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.360
so it's gonna be a string instead of being good date.

29
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.100
And when the user inputs the date in this form,

30
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.690
we're gonna use some string functions to extract the date elements.

31
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.310
So we're gonna use the left function,

32
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.300
and the left function is string function,

33
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.150
and it works the same way as the less function in the Excel grade is a text function.

34
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.290
So you're gonna input the text that you need to extract the data from.

35
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.980
And then how many characters?

36
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.770
So we're gonna extract a day from the 1st 2 characters on the left and then the month we're

37
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.680
gonna expect it in another variable here from the two characters in the middle.

38
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.860
And then the year we're going to extract it from the four characters on the very right.

39
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.820
And then we're going to use the date serial function,

40
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:31.100
which accepts three arguments the year on the month and today to input the date in the

41
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.270
correct form.

42
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.860
And of course,

43
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.930
these three variables are declared as integers because on the date serial,

44
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.510
you should have the arguments the year on the month in the day as integer.

45
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.910
So this way,

46
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.190
no matter what the date format on the computer that the macro is running on,

47
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.840
we're going to get consistent results.

48
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.890
We're going to get the correct results each and every time.

49
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.340
So it's running and see what happens.

50
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.030
So the M plea i d.

51
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.050
We're gonna put seven here and say We're gonna put Alan Smith,

52
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.220
and then the employees hiring dates may say we're gonna put the seventh of June 2016 and

53
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.880
see what the L put would be.

54
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.050
So as you can see here,

55
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.940
we've all pitted the date in the correct format.

56
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.350
And if this macro is run on a computer that has its state formatted in the American format

57
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.350
,

58
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.070
it would still output the correct date.

59
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.770
The date will actually appear here in the American format because the computer is formatted

60
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.890
in the American format.

61
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.630
So the day that would appear in this cell with the 0607 2016 however,

62
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.650
the date that you're gonna input is gonna be interpreted correctly,

63
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.430
no matter what the date format on the computer that the macro is running on is so that's it

64
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.450
for the second example for the input box.

65
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.350
Thank you very much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
