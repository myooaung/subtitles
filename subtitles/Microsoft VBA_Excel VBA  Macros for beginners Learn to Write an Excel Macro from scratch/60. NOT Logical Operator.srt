00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
Hey,

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,760
guys,

3
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,450
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,310
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,410
we're going to discuss the not logical operator.

6
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,630
So the not logical operator,

7
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,260
what it does is that it converts true values to fulls and vice versa.

8
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,660
So we will also convert to full value to it.

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,080
True.

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,140
So you're in this simple macro here.

11
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,900
We're gonna create a variable,

12
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,970
which is X,

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,290
and we're gonna put a value of three to the X variable.

14
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,130
And then we're gonna have an if statement here.

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,480
So here on the first part of the if statement,

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:32,910
it says,

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,020
if not,

18
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,960
X is equal to three.

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,830
Then give me a message.

20
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,880
Box X is not equal to three.

21
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,470
So basically,

22
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,210
X is equal to three.

23
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,480
This part here will yield a true because X is actually equal to three.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,400
However,

25
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,280
because it's put inside a not logical operator.

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,090
This means that this true yielded by this part,

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,040
we're actually become a full,

28
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,670
so this whole thing will become a fulls.

29
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,280
So that means that this if statement when executed,

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,380
it's not going to go and execute the message box because the condition here,

31
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,800
which is not X equal to three,

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,090
is equal to false because you could see her That the form of an if statement here is that

33
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,900
if condition is equal to true,

34
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,410
then you can go ahead and execute the code.

35
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,900
So this part here not x equal to three is actually the condition.

36
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,450
And this is going to become a fool's right,

37
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,960
cause X is equal to three.

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,770
This is true,

39
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,530
but because is inside,

40
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,060
not,

41
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,010
then it's gonna become a false.

42
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,390
Now,

43
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,890
if you look on the following else If part here,

44
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,460
we will see her X is not equal to three.

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,650
This part here will yield the fools.

46
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,990
But because it's put inside and not,

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,360
then it's gonna be a two.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,360
So here the condition is going to be equal to true.

49
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,430
And actually,

50
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,630
we're gonna have this message box executed.

51
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,380
X is equal to three.

52
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,280
So let's run through that and see what happens.

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,330
So here we're gonna sign X equal to three,

54
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,120
and then we're gonna test this.

55
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,130
This condition,

56
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,630
not X equal to three,

57
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,440
is gonna be a full.

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,890
So the message box the 1st 1 here is not gonna be executed.

59
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,110
And then we're gonna test the else.

60
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,810
If here and you consider that the message box has been executed.

61
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,030
So basically,

62
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,070
in a nutshell,

63
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,240
the not logical operator converts to true to a fool's or a full Stewart.

64
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,620
True,

65
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,400
and it's important to know about that logical operator.

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,270
You could find it in somebody else's code,

67
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:42,150
or you could use it to convert a true value to a fool's or vice versa.

68
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,950
So that's it,

69
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,300
guys,

70
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,030
for the not logical operator,

71
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,140
thinking very much watching this video,

72
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,050
and I'll see on the next one.
