Hey,

2
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.580
guys,

3
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.940
welcome backs in this video.

4
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:07.950
We're going to see how we can use the range object in combination with this sells object.

5
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.830
So remember,

6
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.170
guys,

7
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.990
when we're speaking about the range object and when we write rains and open brackets,

8
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.660
you can see here that the range object actually has to import cell one and cell too.

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.890
So basically it has a starting sell.

10
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.980
You put a starting cel in the cel one input,

11
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.610
and then you put unending cel in the cel to import,

12
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.360
and actually the range will span between these two cells.

13
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.700
Okay,

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.450
so this is gonna form your rage of cells.

15
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.610
Okay,

16
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.620
so these starting and ending cells can be written in any way that we would like so we can

17
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.670
write them using the range object.

18
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.390
Or we can also write them using the cells collection.

19
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.010
Object.

20
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.580
Okay.

21
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.160
So we could write range,

22
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.280
sells one comma one,

23
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480
and then you put a comma and then in cell two would write cells,

24
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.730
four comma three equals 50.

25
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.500
Okay,

26
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.040
so what's gonna happen is that Excel will put the value of 50 in the range spanning between

27
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.130
the cell in the first row and the first column,

28
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.530
which is sell a one and the cell in the fourth row,

29
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.670
and the third column,

30
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.550
which is Cell C four.

31
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.120
So what's gonna happen is that Excel will put the value of 50 in the range spanning between

32
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.870
the cell in the first row in the first column,

33
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.980
which is sell a one and the cell in the fourth row,

34
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.380
and the third column,

35
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.580
which is Cell C four.

36
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.350
So if you run that you consider that the value of 50 has been put in that range.

37
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.310
You can also mix between the range object and the cells collection object in one range.

38
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.610
So instead of writing sells one comma,

39
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.950
one you could write range a one,

40
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.110
and that is gonna have the same effect.

41
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.650
So if you run that,

42
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.270
you can see here that the value of 50 as well has been put in the same range.

43
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.810
Okay,

44
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.480
so basically,

45
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.600
you can put the starting and the ending cells of a range object either using the range

46
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.850
object or using the cells collection object or you can actually mix between them.

47
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.480
Okay,

48
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.270
so ah,

49
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.730
that's it,

50
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.340
guys,

51
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.490
for that lecture.

52
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.750
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see on the next one
