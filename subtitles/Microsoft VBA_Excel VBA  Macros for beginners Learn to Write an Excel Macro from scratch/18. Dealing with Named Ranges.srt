00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
in this video,

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,140
we're going to see how we can deal with main drain jizz in our VB.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,790
A coat and ah,

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:12,890
named range is a single cell or multiple cells that you can give a certain name to it.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:19,200
And then you can refer to that single cell range of cells using that name instead of their

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,980
of the cells names.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,200
They're saying C three or a three or C 32 d five.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,080
You can name that my table,

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,720
for example,

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,280
and that just refer to it as my table.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,010
OK,

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,060
so to create a name dreamed,

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,940
you can select yourselves first of all,

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,740
so you can select a 12 f then,

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,620
for example,

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,460
and then go to this name box here and then just Ah,

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:45,960
right,

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,010
my underscore table,

19
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,970
the all name at my table.

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,950
Okay.

21
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,080
And then a press enter.

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,890
So now my table refers to that range of cells.

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,840
So I've selected my table here from this drop down menu,

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,500
and then it's now referring to this range of cells.

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,150
I can put a value into this range of cells.

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,420
So put a 12 left in two b equals then and then I can write,

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,230
equals some,

28
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,100
for example.

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,570
And then I can hurt too.

30
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,650
Ah,

31
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,310
this strange is my table.

32
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:30,960
Instead of ah selecting this strange to be a a 12 F 10 or writing it as a 12 f them and

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,540
then if I hit enter it will give me the summation off that range of cells.

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:37,950
Okay,

35
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,840
on a range can be a single cells.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,050
Well,

37
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,280
so you can select a single cell on Just name it,

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,840
ma.

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,860
You sell or whatever.

40
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,150
On duh you could you can apply a name to a single cell.

41
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,170
Okay,

42
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,960
so let's see how we condemn eel with named ranges in our V v a coats,

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,030
old elites that here how the have done.

44
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,010
And then I'll write a new macro.

45
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,450
So my names range.

46
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,190
Okay,

47
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,990
so it's a very simple you're we're just gonna write range and then open parenthesis is and

48
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,250
then open double quotes and then write my underscore table.

49
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,950
And you can see her that I've written it all in lower case and that won't make any

50
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,430
difference.

51
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:31,310
Is the name Dreams is originally having uppercase letters as the first letters on the two

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,630
words on my and table.

53
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,890
So actually have written it all in lower case and that I won't make any difference because

54
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,750
Excel will ignore the difference in the casing off the letters.

55
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,660
Okay,

56
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,760
so that one cause any problems.

57
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,360
So if I run the macro,

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,740
you will just put the value of 10 in all the cells in that range.

59
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,730
So it's very simple.

60
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,280
You write range and then open parentheses and then open double courts and you write the

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,250
name of the range and you called the courts and close parentheses.

62
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,000
And this is how you can refer to a name grease.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,510
Okay,

64
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,560
so I thank you guys for watching this lecture and please follow me onto the next one.
