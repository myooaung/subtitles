00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
Hey,

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,130
guys,

3
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,700
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,660
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,120
we're going to discuss with statement and xlv b A.

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,960
So the with statement ing salvi B A is a statement that allows you to save a bit of space

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,870
and a bit of code typing or key strokes on your keyboard.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,680
It doesn't give you any extra functionality,

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,200
so it's not like if you don't use it,

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,230
you will be missing.

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,630
Anything is just safe sometime and keystrokes.

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,560
So basically,

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,490
the with statement allows you to apply different methods and properties to a certain object

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,040
that you choose to use with the with statement.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,680
So let's say here I'm gonna add the value of 52 range.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,380
They want to sell a one,

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,930
and then I'm gonna make the fund bold.

18
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,220
I'm gonna make it italics,

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,170
and I'm gonna make it.

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,590
So I use to be 12.

21
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,470
So if you run this macro,

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,350
that is gonna happen here in a cell,

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:04,650
a one you can actually dual these actions using the with statement as well.

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:12,050
So the structure of the with is basically with and then range a one.

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,000
So who want to do the same thing using the with statement so with range anyone.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,120
And don't forget to write the end with because this marks the end of the actions that

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,540
you're going to do to your objects.

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,150
So you with that particular object,

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,760
you're going to start writing.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,980
What do you want to do with it?

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,430
OK,

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,130
so you're going to start writing the methods and properties that you want to take actions

33
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,500
with.

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:43,640
So basically dot value and you can see here that the intelligence for V B A is working the

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,230
auto complete feature and VB is working because it's understanding that this is a with

36
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,700
statement.

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,760
I'm trying to do stuff to their objects.

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:58,670
So dark value equals 50 and then dot fond I doubt bold equals true.

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,320
And then dot fund dot italics equals true as well,

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,490
and then dot font size equals 12.

41
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:15,990
So this with statement is gonna accomplish the same thing as these statements and notice

42
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,990
here that I've actually indented my code a bit.

43
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,920
So I've invented what's between the within the end with by actually hitting tab on my

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,620
keyboard.

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,800
So if I actually press,

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,950
enter here and I'm at the beginning of the line.

47
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,370
If I want to invent that line a bit.

48
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,250
Press tab on my keyboard.

49
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,970
Okay?

50
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,920
And I'm just inventing.

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,230
Get for readability.

52
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,860
So this does not affect the execution of your code or anything.

53
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,170
It's just effects the readability.

54
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,370
It makes it more readable.

55
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:51,160
It gives you the sentence or the feeling that these actions year that I'm taking on that

56
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,820
object are between this with and this end with statement,

57
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,270
they are enclosed inside it.

58
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,440
So it just makes your code more readable.

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,310
Doesn't affect the execution of your coat.

60
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,930
So I'm actually going to highlight the previous code,

61
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,410
and I'm actually gonna comment that code.

62
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,200
So I'm gonna comment all that block of code so that it wouldn't be executed,

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,140
and then I'm actually going to delete the contents of that.

64
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,090
So I'm going to clear everything so clear value on formatting and everything.

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,450
And then if I execute that code,

66
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,710
you can see here that we've done the same thing,

67
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,380
basically,

68
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:35,250
So this with statement allows you to do the same thing as the above four lines of code,

69
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,950
except that you do it with less keystrokes.

70
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,360
So if you don't use the with statement,

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,550
you will not be missing any functionality.

72
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,430
It's just that you're gonna save some keystrokes when you use it.

73
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,620
So sit guys for the with statement.

74
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,330
Thank you very much watching this video,

75
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,060
and I'll see you on the next one.
