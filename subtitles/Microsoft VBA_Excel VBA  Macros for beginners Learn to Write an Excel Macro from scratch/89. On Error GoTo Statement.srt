1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
Okay,

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:00,740
guys.

3
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,730
So another way to handle the errors that is more sophisticated than just ignoring them is

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,820
actually using the on error.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,700
Go to statement.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,130
So with the on our go to statement,

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,670
you can create a point that you Congar 02 in case that there is an error.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,860
So,

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,530
for example,

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,870
here on our code,

11
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,810
let's say we have this line of code here.

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,400
Worksheets,

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,170
my worksheet select this line of code will create an error,

14
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,070
a runtime error because we don't have a worksheet that is called my worksheet that exists

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,300
in this workbook.

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,310
So I've got here this statement that is written before it on error go to create my

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,920
worksheet.

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,080
So it will go to this point here called Create my Worksheet in case of having an error.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,310
So on this point called create my worksheet me to have some code to handle the error.

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,490
So,

21
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,140
for example,

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,780
we can create that particular worksheet that is called my worksheet.

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,250
So you could write worksheets dot ad and then active sheet.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,300
The name is equal to my worksheet.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,890
This is one way of doing it.

26
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,360
This is one way off creating a new worksheet.

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,600
There is also another way is where she dot ADOT name is equal to my worksheet.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,730
So if we run this code this way,

29
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,950
it's stepped through it step by step here,

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,650
so I'll start running the code here.

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,340
We're gonna run this line of code here that is going to throw an error.

32
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,540
So what's gonna happen because of the air?

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,990
We're gonna go to the part here for creating a new worksheets are gonna go to create my

34
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,640
worksheet.

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
And if you execute that,

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,630
you can see her that a new worksheet has been created this cold Molly worksheet.

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,770
So this is a way of handling the error in case the work she does not exist.

38
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,820
We're gonna go to create it.

39
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,310
Okay,

40
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,850
so this way your code would not throw an error.

41
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,330
Okay,

42
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,710
so let's say that I have more code,

43
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,170
actually,

44
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,400
after selecting my worksheet after the line of court for selecting the worksheet called

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,180
Molly Worksheet.

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,340
So let's say I'm gonna put in cell a one I'm gonna put today state.

47
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,380
And now let's say that this line of code has failed,

48
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,390
so I'm gonna go to create the sheet.

49
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,800
So what if I want to resume executing the lines of code after the one that's caused the ER

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:19,800
,

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,850
we can actually write the line of code resume next,

52
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,450
so resume next will actually go back to the line of code that's caused the error,

53
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,730
but it will not executed.

54
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,890
It will execute any line of code after so start executing any lines of code after the line

55
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,550
of code that's caused the error.

56
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,590
So now I'm gonna delete this worksheet here called Molly Worksheet.

57
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm gonna go back to my visual basic environment and let's start executing the code step by

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,440
step here.

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,810
So on our go to create me worksheet and then you can see here,

60
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,430
I'm gonna execute this line of code,

61
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,780
which is going to throw an error.

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,550
So we're gonna go to create the work sheep.

63
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,760
And so I've created it.

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,140
Now watch what happens when I execute the resume next line of code here,

65
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,710
it will go and execute any lines of code after the one that's caused theorist.

66
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,200
So here,

67
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,310
we're gonna execute this one here that is gonna put today's date in cell a one.

68
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,000
Now if we execute the following line of code,

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,320
it will actually go and execute the line of code for adding a new worksheet called my

70
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,810
Worksheet,

71
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,710
which is gonna cause an error because we already have a worksheet called my worksheet.

72
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,690
So in this case,

73
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,510
we need to exit the macro,

74
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:41,790
so it's better to write exit sub here after I've done what I wanted to do and put my date

75
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,930
in cell a one.

76
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,870
If I don't want to do anything more,

77
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,370
I will just exit the macro.

78
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:46,850
Okay,

79
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,940
so it's better to do it this way.

80
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,150
If we delete the worksheet,

81
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,570
called my worksheet and start executing our code again here,

82
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,820
we're going to select the work she called my worksheet and it doesn't exist.

83
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,440
We're going to create a new work.

84
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,880
She called my worksheet and then resume next,

85
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,160
put the date and then exit the macro.

86
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,560
So this is a more advanced way than just ignoring the errors.

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,720
To use the honor,

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,380
go to statement and use the resume next statement here in case we want to go back and

89
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,070
execute any lines of quote after the one that's caused the air.

90
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,470
OK,

91
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,610
so thanks,

92
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:23,810
guys,

93
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,690
for watching this video.

94
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,860
I'll see you on the next one
