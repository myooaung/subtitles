00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
in this video,

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,130
we're going to speak about the select method for the range object.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,110
So the range dot select method.

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,120
What it does is that it's elects your range,

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,450
okay?

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:17,110
And that range could be either a single cell or actually multiple cells.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:22,290
So I've created a macro here called Select Underscore Range.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,850
And for example,

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:31,960
if I type range a one select and you can see here as I'm typing the word select,

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,890
Actually,

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,930
I'm getting suggestions year by this Oh,

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,140
to complete function in Excel V B A.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,260
So you can see here that the select methods is gonna pop up here,

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,670
sport to the choices.

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,400
So if I click on the top key on my keyboard,

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,050
you can see here the of being able to select the select method.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,120
And now,

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,340
if I run the macro what this method does,

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,560
is it simply select your range?

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:58,820
Okay,

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,810
so this is going to select cell a one.

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,850
So watch here,

23
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:08,120
sell a one when I click on run and concede here that sell a one has been selected.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,890
You can also use the select method to select You're named range.

25
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,010
So remember guys,

26
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,000
when we created a named range cold.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My underscore table previously so that named range actually exists right now.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,810
So when I run this,

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,800
it's going to select my named range,

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,850
which waas between cells.

31
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,790
A 12 afternoon.

32
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,610
Okay,

33
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,080
so this is simply a select method.

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,310
All it does is that it selects your range.

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,190
And this is an important method that you probably use a lot because you'd want to select to

36
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,050
sell and do stuff to it.

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,150
Okay,

38
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,680
so ah,

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,060
this is the select method remembers.

40
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:00,280
Select is a method because methods are actually verbs or something that you would do.

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,900
OK,

42
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,260
so you're doing something.

43
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,110
You're selecting your cell.

44
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,010
So that's why select is a method.

45
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,410
Okay,

46
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,800
so thank you guys for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
