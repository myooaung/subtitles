00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430
Hey,

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:00,710
guys,

3
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,420
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,610
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,210
we're going to discuss another type of loops which is the do Loop and the Do loop has a

6
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,480
general structure of do and then whatever code you need to be executed over and over again

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,280
and then the word loop.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,840
However,

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,700
if you use the do loop in this structure,

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,950
the loop will just keep on getting executed over and over again.

11
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,820
And it will not stop unless you do something special,

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,220
like use the exit,

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,870
do statement or use a go to statement.

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,410
Or so this is why it's actually got to variations.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,630
The are used usually,

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,310
and these two variations are to do until and do y o.

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:48,910
So the do until has a structure of do until condition is equal to two and then some code

18
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,150
and then loop.

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,380
Or alternatively,

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,170
it could be written as do and then code,

21
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,960
and then loop until condition is equal to true.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,790
So actually,

23
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:03,080
on the do until whatever code you put inside the loop will be just performed over and over

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,020
again until a certain condition is true.

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,800
So whatever that condition is satisfied and becomes to the loop will seize to be executed.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,750
The Lupul just and and you will exit the loop and perform whatever code is after the loop

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,480
and on the do while,

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,840
as you can see here,

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,880
it's got a structure of do while condition is equal to true,

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,350
and then the code,

31
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,510
and then loop,

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,530
or do and then the code,

33
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,480
and then loop while the condition is equal to true.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,760
So the do while structure we'll get whatever could you put in there performed over and over

35
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,950
again as long as a condition is true while a condition is true,

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,590
so as long as this condition is true,

37
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,920
the code is just going to be executed over and over against.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,720
This is the difference between to do while on do until to do until it's performed until a

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,860
condition is true and the do while is performed while a condition is true,

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,250
or or as long as a condition is true.

41
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,390
So if the condition turns is out to be false on the do while the loop is just gonna end and

42
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,550
we will execute whatever code is after the loop.

43
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,100
So what's the difference between the two variations on each structures so What's the

44
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,740
difference between the one on the left and the one on the right,

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,620
for example?

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:28,930
Well,

47
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,840
the difference is on the one on the left here.

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,180
The condition will be evaluated before the code is executed,

49
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,620
so we will not execute the code at all before evaluating the condition.

50
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,140
However,

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,360
on the one on the right,

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,720
we could have at least one pass through the code before the condition is evaluated.

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,350
And so,

54
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,880
in terms of performance,

55
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,910
the variation on the left here can be faster than the one on the right.

56
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,780
Because with the one on the left,

57
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,410
you could have the condition to be equal to two and not have to execute the code,

58
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,930
not have to do that.

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,080
One passed through the code and this could save you time on your code.

60
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,880
So the one on the left here could save you more time in case the condition is evaluated to

61
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:20,600
to before going through the code one time and the same goes for the do while as well on the

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,480
do I owe.

63
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,350
The one on the left here can save you time as well,

64
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:31,090
because the condition is evaluated before the code is executed at least once.

65
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,010
So this conceive you time as well.

66
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,550
So this was a quick introduction about the Do Loop on the upcoming videos.

67
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,400
We're gonna go into more depth about the do loop,

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
and we're going to see some examples as well.

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,110
So thanks,

70
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,380
guys.

71
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,410
Watching this video,

72
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,750
and I'll see you on the next one.
