00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
Hagos,

2
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.340
welcome back.

3
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.350
So in this video,

4
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.200
we're going to discuss the simple if statement,

5
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.580
So the simple if statement is used in checking if a condition has been achieved or if a

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.710
condition is true and if that's the case,

7
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.100
then there is some code or some actions that you're gonna take based on the fact that this

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.450
condition is true.

9
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.670
And if the condition is fulls than the actions will not be executed or the code will not be

10
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:40.050
executed and its structure in its simplest form is basically if condition equals to true,

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.960
then there is some code to be executed here,

12
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.680
and then we've got the end.

13
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.820
If so,

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.970
you will basically have some code wrapped between the if and the end.

15
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.950
If and this code is executed,

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.680
if and only if condition is equal to true out.

17
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.200
Of course,

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.620
if the condition is equal to fulsome than the code is not going to be executed.

19
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.550
So basically the code execution will resume after the end.

20
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.830
If statement and the code part here will be bypassed,

21
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.260
they will not be executed.

22
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.630
Okay,

23
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.540
so let's have an example here.

24
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.400
So the example I've got here is basically to test that some sales persons are achieving the

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.020
target.

26
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.340
And if it's the case,

27
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.370
would have a message box popped.

28
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.480
The this sales person has achieved the target on If not,

29
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.450
we will not have the message box pop.

30
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.240
So basically off created here two variables.

31
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.330
The first variable is the sale stargate,

32
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.480
which is an integer which is gonna be basically our target,

33
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.280
which is 20,000.

34
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.210
And we've got the sales person which is gonna be actually taking the name of the sales

35
00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.750
person as a strength from this cells containing the sales person.

36
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.550
And this macro needs to be executed while you're actually having the sales amount selected

37
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.550
.

38
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.240
And if you check the variable sales person where it gets its value from its basically the

39
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.180
value of the active celled offset.

40
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.190
So that means we're going to move from the active cell zero a negative one zeros negative

41
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.460
one.

42
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.850
That means one column to the left dot value.

43
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.320
So while you're standing on the sales amount,

44
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.860
the sales person variable gets its value from the cell that is zeros and negative one

45
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.270
columns.

46
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.630
That means one calm to the left.

47
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.380
And that means the column containing this sales person.

48
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.750
And then this is our if statement here,

49
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.410
if the value of the active seldom value,

50
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.860
which were standing on which contains the sales amount,

51
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.200
is greater than or equal to the sale Stargate,

52
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.200
then this message box is gonna be pumped,

53
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.290
which is the sales person.

54
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.720
Whoever his name is achieved,

55
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.460
the target and notice year that we've got a space before the word achieve yer so as to have

56
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.250
a space between the name of the sales person and the word achieved.

57
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.710
Okay,

58
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.250
so let's start going through this code here.

59
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.780
You need to make sure that the value for the sales amount is selected at the beginning,

60
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.580
and then we're gonna go through the coat step by step.

61
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.330
So you're the variable called sales target is given the value of 20,000.

62
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.300
She's our target,

63
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.260
and then here will get the value.

64
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.010
The sales person in this case is Jennifer because we selected the sales amount for Jennifer

65
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.720
and then if the value of the active cells greater than or equal to the sale started,

66
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.270
is it?

67
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.080
Yes,

68
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.750
it is.

69
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.790
This message box is gonna be popped.

70
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.370
So we're gonna go to execute the message box is going to say Jennifer achieved the target

71
00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:00.160
and if and and sub and you need to highlight the value for the sales a month for each sales

72
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.130
person to be able to execute the macro.

73
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.780
And this one as well has achieved because he's 21,000.

74
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.050
And then if we go to Jack,

75
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.840
he's 15,000.

76
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.950
He's less than two target,

77
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.080
so he's not gonna have the message box,

78
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.050
and that's it.

79
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.780
And you can do it for each sales person.

80
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.140
But you need to make sure that you selected the sales amount in the future when we learned

81
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.890
about loops,

82
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.580
you're gonna learn,

83
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.000
actually,

84
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.920
how to do this without needing to have the cell for the sales amount selected.

85
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.880
And you can just look through the cells and get that done without even needing to select

86
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.450
the cell for the sales amount.

87
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.480
Okay,

88
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.000
so this is not actually the best way to do it.

89
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.950
But it's just an example to demonstrate the if statement,

90
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.510
I want to note something else here,

91
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.410
which is that you're actually able to write the if statement and the line of code that you

92
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.130
need to execute on one line and remove the end.

93
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.250
If they're able to actually do that,

94
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.530
I'm gonna cut the message box here,

95
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.240
Put it on the same line.

96
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.290
So if and then the condition is tested,

97
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.000
then do this and remove the end.

98
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.180
If your code will work this way,

99
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.470
however,

100
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.720
this actually has to down sites.

101
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.560
The 1st 1 is that you can only execute one line of code this way as a result of the

102
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.030
condition that you're testing being true.

103
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.350
So you cannot put multiple lines of code to be executed.

104
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.730
That's the first disadvantage.

105
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.680
The 2nd 1 is that the code does not look very neat.

106
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.720
It is actually better to have the if condition put on one line and then put it then and

107
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.050
then put the lines of code that you need to execute and put an end.

108
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.000
If this marks a beginning and an end for your if statement makes it more readable.

109
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.920
So actually,

110
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.650
if we test this code this way,

111
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.640
if we stepped through it step by step by using F eight on a keyboard,

112
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.660
sincere that the code executes fine and with no problems.

113
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.550
However,

114
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.640
this is not the recommended way to write an if statement,

115
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.900
you'll find more than 90% of the people writes the if on one line and then the resulting

116
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.190
lines of code that need to execute and put an end if this marks a beginning and an end for

117
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.120
the if statement makes your code a lot more readable.

118
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.180
So I hope this lecture was informative for you guys.

119
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.270
We will learn more about the if statement in the upcoming videos.

120
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.350
Thank you very much watching this video I don't see on the next one.
