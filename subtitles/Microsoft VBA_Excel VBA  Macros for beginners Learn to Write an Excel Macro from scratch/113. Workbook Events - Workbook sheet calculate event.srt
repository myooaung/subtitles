00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
this video,

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,510
We're going to discuss the workbook sheet calculate event so the workbook sheet calculate

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:13,410
event gets triggered whenever a calculation happens in any sheet on your workbook.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:13,840
OK,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,710
any sheet that would have calculations happen on it will trigger this event.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,360
However,

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,070
if you,

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,980
for example,

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,320
change the value of a cell.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,420
But that does not trigger any calculations,

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,120
this event will not be triggered.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,400
Okay,

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,520
So,

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,090
for example,

15
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:35,390
if you enter your name in a cell and this does not require any calculations toe happen,

16
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,050
so there are no other cells.

17
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:44,900
The are reading your name from from that cell that you entered your name on and no

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,550
calculations are required than actually this event will not be triggered.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,150
This event also has a parameter cold as h here as an object.

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,480
It's a sheet object,

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,420
and it actually refers to the sheet that the calculations happened on.

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,460
So let's have an example.

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:05,970
For example,

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,260
I'm just going to write a message box here that says calculations happened in.

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,010
I'm gonna put a space here,

26
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,750
and then I'm gonna close the double quotes.

27
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,880
I'm gonna have an M percent and concurrent innate that on s h dot name.

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,880
So actually is going to say calculations happened in sheet.

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,610
Whatever.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,050
The name of the sheet is that the calculations happened on.

31
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,730
So,

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,090
actually,

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,150
let's try,

34
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,900
for example,

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,820
here in this sheet,

36
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,150
CI 28 I'm just gonna try writing my name here,

37
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,630
okay?

38
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,530
And this has not triggered the event because no calculations were needed when I entered my

39
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,100
name.

40
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,660
Even if I enter the number five year,

41
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,030
there are no other cells reading from that cell.

42
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,920
So no calculations air needed.

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,910
And this is why the event has not been triggered.

44
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,080
If I enter equals one plus one,

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,230
this will trigger calculation is says calculations happen in Cheat 28.

46
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,740
Ah,

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,260
very So.

48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,750
Shh.

49
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,620
Actually refers to the sheet that calculation happened on if you even right equals two,

50
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,150
okay,

51
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,270
this for a sally's of formula.

52
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,550
And for that,

53
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,490
Excel will need to do calculations.

54
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,440
So this is going to trigger the event.

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,930
OK,

56
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,420
so,

57
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,000
actually,

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,010
as you can see here,

59
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,910
this triggered the event.

60
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,100
If you enter your name and there is another formula,

61
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,850
for example,

62
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:34,110
reading the cell or reading from the cell that you entered your name on this trigger

63
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,150
calculation so this actually will make the event got triggered.

64
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,630
So Ah,

65
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,190
that's it,

66
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,820
Guys for the workbook sheet calculate event.

67
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,900
I typically don't use it a lot because this event can actually slow down your workbook

68
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,030
because it's gonna run a lot if you use it.

69
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,490
Because pretty much any change that you do anything that you select world triggers and

70
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,240
calculations.

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,410
So this would run a lot and would slow down your workbooks.

72
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,510
They need to be using a very cautiously.

73
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:07,810
Okay,

74
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,320
you need to be careful if you're going to use it and make sure if you're going to use it is

75
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:19,650
the lost resort and that you've researched all the other options and that you absolutely

76
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,850
need to use it.

77
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,360
So thanks,

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,620
guys,

79
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,300
watching this video and I'll see you on the next one.
