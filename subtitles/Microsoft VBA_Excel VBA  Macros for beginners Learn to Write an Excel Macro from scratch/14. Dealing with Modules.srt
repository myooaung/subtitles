00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170
Hey,

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,480
guys,

3
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,860
welcome backs in this video.

4
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,800
We're going to see how we can deal with modules,

5
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,170
so modules air basically containers for your coat.

6
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,810
And in order to insert a new module,

7
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:16,320
you can go to this menu and click on the arrow and then click on module to insert a new

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,790
module.

9
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:23,590
You can also go to the insert menu here and then click on module and have now inserted a

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,900
new module and Excel or the V B.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,280
A environment by default has named a module to okay,

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
and you can rename a module by selecting it,

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,080
and then the properties window for it will appear.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,460
Then you can just delete its name and give it a new name.

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,760
I'll name it my module.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,040
The name that you give it needs not to have any spaces,

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,610
and it needs not to be part off the reserved keywords or the reserve boards in V.

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:52,790
B.

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,060
A.

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,680
And actually,

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,390
there is a lecture listing their reserved words in V B A.

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,510
So you can check that,

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,290
and I can make an experiment here.

24
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,690
I can just put a space between Mayan module and hit enter,

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,230
and you can see here that this is not a legal object name.

26
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,870
Excel is not accepting it,

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,700
so I'll just rename it my module with no spaces.

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,010
That's great.

29
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,250
So I've renamed my module,

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,810
and you can also delete a module by right clicking on it and click on remove it.

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,820
Remove on so it will list.

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,770
Remove and then the name of your module.

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,600
So I'll just click on that.

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,410
And actually,

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,290
when you asked to remove it,

36
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,270
you can actually have the option to export it before you're moving it.

37
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,940
So maybe you wanna you want to save the V B A code,

38
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,940
and it maybe you want to have it,

39
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,040
because you might need this vb a code later on in a different workbook or so because you

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,670
can actually import it later,

41
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,570
and we will see how to do that.

42
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,690
So Excel gives you the option of exporting its.

43
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,870
It asked you whether you would like to export before you're moving it or not.

44
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,590
Let's say I want to export it.

45
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,960
If I don't want to exploit it,

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,060
I will click on no,

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,950
and then Excel will just delete it without saving it or exporting it.

48
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,030
So if I click on Yes,

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,040
because I want to,

50
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,600
Let's say,

51
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,540
Want to save the code I click on Yes.

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,360
And then,

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,090
actually,

54
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,990
I can save it.

55
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,300
I'll save it on my desktop Here should just save that.

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,760
Okay and Excel deleted it.

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,430
But I saved it before Excel deleted it.

58
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,760
So I do have the code.

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,390
If there had been code on this model,

60
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,710
it's actually a blank module on.

61
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,450
Let's say that I want to import it again.

62
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,760
I can click on this.

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,530
Click on this modules folder or right click on any module,

64
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,330
OK,

65
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,000
and then click on import foil and then I will select my module here and just double click

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,420
on it.

67
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,660
I'll click on it and click open on.

68
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,440
Then Excel will insert the module again into the V B.

69
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,610
A environment basically Okay,

70
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,820
This was just an overview about how to deal with the modules.

71
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,750
Thank you very much,

72
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,130
guys,

73
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,090
