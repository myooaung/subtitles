00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
and this video,

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.470
we're going to see how we can copy a worksheet using V B A.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.570
So to actually compete a worksheet in V.

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.800
B.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.170
A.

6
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.690
We need to use the worksheet dot com p method and the work she thought.

7
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.450
Campy method has two parameters the before and after parameters,

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.170
and they work exactly as how they did on the worksheet dot add method.

9
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:34.140
So they actually copy the sheet and put the new copy before or after the worksheet that you

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.300
would specify on the before or after parameters.

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.000
Okay,

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.780
so let's go back to the visual basic editor and see how that works.

13
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.070
Okay,

14
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.960
So to copy worksheet,

15
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.370
we need to use the worksheet dot copy method.

16
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.900
So we need to actually specify the name of the worksheet that we need to.

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.050
Copies were gonna write worksheets sheet one dot copy.

18
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.930
So I say I want a copy sheet one here that I've got and then when we press space.

19
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.300
Actually,

20
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.770
there is nothing that would make the parameters appear on the screen here.

21
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.900
The open brackets,

22
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.880
they won't appear.

23
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.950
If you press face,

24
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.550
they won't appear so actually just got to know them.

25
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.250
And let's say we're gonna insert the new sheets before sheet one we're gonna right before

26
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.560
calling equals and then worksheets sheet one.

27
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.790
So what this is going to do is that it's gonna copy sheet one and insert the new copy

28
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.940
before she won,

29
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.820
and that is to the left hand side of sheet one.

30
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.980
So if I run the code,

31
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.060
you can see here that sheet one has been copied.

32
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.960
The new names sheet one with two between parenthesis,

33
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.170
and it's been inserted on the left hand side of sheet one,

34
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.960
if you use the after parameter than this is gonna insert the new sheet after sheet one,

35
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.060
which is to the right hand side of sheet one.

36
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.150
So if you run that,

37
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.410
you can see here that the new sheet has been inserted to the right hand side of sheet one.

38
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.650
If you leave the dot copy method without specifying the before after.

39
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.080
So if you just delete that and we run the code,

40
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.850
what's gonna happen is that sheet one is gonna be copied into a new blank workbook.

41
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.760
So actually Excel is gonna copy it and put it in a new blank workbook.

42
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.900
So if I run the code here.

43
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.580
You can see here that a new blank workbook named Book One has been created with sheet one

44
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.870
copied to it.

45
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.790
Okay.

46
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.250
And then afterwards,

47
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.110
you could save that workbook or do anything to that workbook.

48
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.670
And we will learn how to deal with workbooks later on in the course.

49
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.790
But just know that if you do not specify the before or after parameters on the dot copy

50
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.740
method for the worksheet,

51
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.750
you're gonna have your worksheet copied into a new blank workbook.

52
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.250
Okay,

53
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.760
so another scenario is that if you want your newly copy cheat to have a different name than

54
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.570
sheet one with a number between brackets,

55
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.970
for example so you want to name it my sheet,

56
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.710
for example.

57
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.160
So how do we do that?

58
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.780
Well,

59
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.460
I want to show you something here.

60
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.980
If you select sheet one and copy it.

61
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.290
Some gonna press control on my keyboard here.

62
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.480
I'm gonna copy on the Excel interface,

63
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.290
the Normal Excel interface.

64
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.980
You can see here that the newly created copy cheat here is now the active sheet.

65
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.450
So when you copy a sheet,

66
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.790
the newly copied cheat is gonna be the active sheet.

67
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.050
The copy is gonna be the active sheet.

68
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.150
So we're actually gonna take advantage of that and use an object called the active sheet.

69
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
So the active sheet is a worksheet object,

70
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.420
and it has older methods and properties of a worksheet or a sheet.

71
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.380
So actually,

72
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.660
we're gonna write active sheet,

73
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.120
and then we're going to use the dot name property and change that to whatever name we want

74
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.120
.

75
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.620
So here I'm going to change the name of the active sheets,

76
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.980
which is gonna be the newly comp itchy to my sheet.

77
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.640
So when we run that code,

78
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.050
what's gonna happen is that sheet one is going to be copied,

79
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.780
and then it's gonna become the active sheet,

80
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.620
and then we're going to change its name.

81
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.780
And actually,

82
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.770
if we do,

83
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.370
if you run the code this way,

84
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.260
it's gonna be coming to a new workbook.

85
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.630
So we would write before.

86
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.220
For example,

87
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.010
calling equals worksheets sheet one,

88
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.350
because I don't want a new workbook to be created.

89
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.810
I just wanted to be copied in this existing workbook.

90
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.070
So now a newly copied worksheet is gonna be created on the left hand side of sheet one,

91
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.660
and it's gonna be named my sheet.

92
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.650
So we will run the code now.

93
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.950
And you can see here that a newly created cheat has been created here.

94
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.610
And it is on the left hand side of sheet one.

95
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.780
And it is named Molly Sheet.

96
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.560
Okay,

97
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.070
I So that's it for copying worksheets.

98
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.850
Thank you very much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
