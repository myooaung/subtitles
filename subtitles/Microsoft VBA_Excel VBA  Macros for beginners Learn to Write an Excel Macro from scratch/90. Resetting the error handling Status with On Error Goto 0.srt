00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240
Hey,

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,560
guys,

3
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,160
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,550
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:09,740
we're going to discuss the UN ergo 20 statement so the on error go to zero.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:17,750
What it does is that it resets the air handling status in your VB a code to the default

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,850
status which is basically throwing an error.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,490
So in case that you do not do any error handling,

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,510
what's gonna happen is that when VB encounters,

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,570
an area is just going to throw the runtime error on the message box and you're going to see

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,220
a message box.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,330
It says runtime error.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,250
This is the default air handling status in xlv B A.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,590
And what this is useful for is if we have different statements that can potentially cause

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,010
errors on our code,

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:55,860
and we want to treat each statement differently or handle the error that could potentially

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,440
be caused by each statement differently.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,820
So,

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,430
for example,

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,250
here on this example,

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,230
we've got the line of code worksheets,

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,940
my worksheet select.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,310
This could potentially throwing error.

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,930
However,

25
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,300
if we run it right now,

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,900
while the work she does called my worksheet is created,

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,570
it will not throw an error.

28
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,510
And we've got this statement here on error go to create my worksheet.

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,380
But what if I put another line of code that will create an error?

30
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,890
So I put range a one equals one divided by zero.

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,980
So this will create a division by zero error.

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,260
Now,

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,200
watch what happens when we run this line of code.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,450
So let's start running the macro step by step.

35
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,640
So this line of code will not cause an error for activating the worksheet called Molly

36
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,120
Worksheet because it already exists over when we run this line of code,

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,970
it will actually go to the create my worksheet.

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,130
Because remember,

39
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,400
guys,

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,250
when I told you that when we write in on our statement,

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,030
it will actually start a status of her handling for any statement that follows this

42
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,710
statement.

43
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,990
So as you can see her,

44
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,470
if we run this line of code and it will cause an error,

45
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,830
it will actually go to create my worksheet.

46
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,770
And it will create a worksheet that is called my worksheet.

47
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,420
While we do actually have a worksheet already.

48
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,910
So this will throw an error.

49
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:29,970
So actually this air was handled using the same way as the ER that would potentially be

50
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,620
occurring from this statement and this is something that we do not want to do because this

51
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,430
is a division by zero.

52
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,920
It's not related to creating a worksheet,

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,670
so we would want to handle it differently.

54
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,750
So if we add a statement here on error,

55
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,810
go to zero.

56
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,220
This statement resets the air handling status in your VB a code.

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,660
So now we will go to the default,

58
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,800
are handling status,

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,320
which is actually that if we encounter inner here,

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,640
we're gonna have a division by zero error and then we can actually put another type of

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,380
error handling.

62
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,100
So on air,

63
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,530
go to message box,

64
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,270
for example.

65
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:17,280
And then we would have here a message box placeholder here and we would have a message box

66
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,280
.

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,350
You cannot divide by zero,

68
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,190
and it is better as well to put an on error,

69
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,570
go to zero statement here so that any statement after that one here would not be handled

70
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,810
the same way unless you have more statements that can be handled the same way or that can

71
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,720
take the same error.

72
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,870
Handling goes on our go to message box so you can put them here in between the owner go to

73
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,200
message box on the owner.

74
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,080
Go to zero.

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,460
So,

76
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,360
as you can see here,

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,680
we've used the honor go to zero statement here to reset the air handling status so as to go

78
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,930
back to the default status and start a different status for handling this different error.

79
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,990
So it begins here.

80
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,890
If we run the code right now,

81
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,930
where she eats my work,

82
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,250
she does selects that this will not cause an error.

83
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,060
And then we go to the default air handling status and we start a new era handling status,

84
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,550
which is to go to the message box.

85
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,120
And now this statement causing her will go to the message box.

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,750
You cannot divide by zero,

87
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,630
and then we'll reset our handling status again and exit the sub.

88
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,050
So we use the honor,

89
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:30,120
go to zero statement to reset our handing status because not all hours should be handled

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,060
the same way.

91
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,230
So that's it,

92
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,530
guys,

93
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,410
for the honor,

94
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,750
go to zero statement.

95
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,050
Thank you very much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one
