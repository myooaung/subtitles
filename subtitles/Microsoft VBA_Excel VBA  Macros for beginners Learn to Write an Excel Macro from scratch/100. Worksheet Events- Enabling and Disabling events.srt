00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
Hey,

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,900
guys,

3
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,540
Welcome back.

4
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,540
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,760
we're going to discuss how we can disable the events and how weaken re enable them again.

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,040
Okay,

7
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,680
so if we disable the events,

8
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,350
anything that is triggered as a result of any event is not gonna be triggered.

9
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:14,640
Okay,

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,180
So any code that is triggered,

11
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,750
for example,

12
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,420
by double clicking a cell will not be triggered.

13
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:19,680
Okay?

14
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,000
The events are disabled.

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,710
This feature in Excel will be disabled,

16
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,190
and we'll see why we're going to need to use that.

17
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,650
Okay.

18
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,450
But first of all,

19
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:35,260
to disable an event you can write application dot enable events equals false.

20
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:35,850
Okay,

21
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,840
this is how you condense able events and to re enable them again,

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,480
you can write application dot enable events equals true.

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,510
Okay,

24
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,050
So if you run the first line of code here for the disable events of procedure to run that

25
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,810
events will be disabled.

26
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:55,980
So,

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,570
for example,

28
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,100
on this before DoubleClick sheet here,

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,850
where we explained that before DoubleClick event and we said that if we double click on any

30
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,730
of these names,

31
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,880
it will be transferred to sell l three.

32
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,130
This will not happen.

33
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,370
Okay,

34
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,980
Because events or disabled so any code this triggered as a result of a certain action will

35
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,180
be disabled.

36
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,600
Okay,

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,240
So to re enable the the events again and re enable that feature,

38
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,120
you can just run the application,

39
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,760
enable events equals true.

40
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,040
So if you run that and we double click here because here the names are being transferred to

41
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,870
sell l three.

42
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,130
Okay,

43
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,350
so the events are now working,

44
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,270
and of course,

45
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,590
you can include these line of lines of code in any procedure that you write even in event

46
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,090
procedures,

47
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,710
and we're going to see why these are useful.

48
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,200
Okay,

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,190
if at any point,

50
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,780
you just want to check if events are enabled or disabled,

51
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,200
not enable them were disabled them.

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,650
But just check.

53
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,280
Are they enabled or disabled at the moment at this moment,

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,660
are they enabled or disabled?

55
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,970
You can go to your immediate window.

56
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,310
This is a nice little trick.

57
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,600
Okay,

58
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,610
so you can go to the your immediate window here,

59
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,120
and if it's not enabled,

60
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,950
you can click on view here and then click on immediate window to view.

61
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:16,730
It can write a question mark and then application dot enable events.

62
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,250
Okay.

63
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,800
Do not write equals two or false or anything,

64
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
destroy this question mark application.

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,940
Don't an evil events and press enter you will just tell you.

66
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,120
Is it true or four?

67
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,930
So if it's true,

68
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,170
then they are enabled.

69
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,810
If it's Fallston in events or disables,

70
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:38,600
this is a nice little trick that you can use to check if at a certain moment events are

71
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,490
enabled or disabled and in future videos,

72
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,680
we're going to see ah,

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,320
why enabling and disabling events or useful?

74
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,900
OK,

75
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,590
so thanks for watching this video I'll see on the next one.
