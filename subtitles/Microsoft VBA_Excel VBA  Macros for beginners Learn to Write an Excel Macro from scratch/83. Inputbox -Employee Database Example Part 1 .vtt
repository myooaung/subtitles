00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.240
Hey,

2
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.510
guys,

3
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.240
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.520
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.590
we're going tohave another example for the input box,

6
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.870
and we're basically gonna create an employee database using input boxes.

7
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.880
So we're gonna input some impl eat data.

8
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.250
So here I've created the macro that would do that.

9
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.250
The first stop on the macro is that we're gonna activate the employee data worksheet,

10
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.140
and then we're actually going to get the last throw on the worksheet.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.470
And we're going to do that using column Azour going to get the lost row on column a size to

12
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.620
be able to know where the loss employee is and then enter the data for the next employees

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.310
on the following row.

14
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.410
Now we're gonna have a variable they schooled.

15
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.110
I be underscore i d.

16
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.180
And it's type is an integer,

17
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.290
and this variable is gonna contain the value for the input box that's gonna ask for the M

18
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.390
plea I d.

19
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.290
And with great as an integer because the idea is going to be a number,

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.950
of course.

21
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.300
And please note that although the input box outputs a data type of a string,

22
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.730
V B A is quite a forgiving language on that and this I be underscore I d variable.

23
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:21.830
That is an integer is not going to cause a problem because VB A will do what is called an

24
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.940
implicit data type converge in in other programming languages.

25
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.470
This could cause a problem,

26
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.650
but in VB a,

27
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.070
it will not now.

28
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.090
The following step is that we're gonna put the I.

29
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.390
D.

30
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.820
Number in the cell that is following the loss wrote in Column A says he can see ourselves l

31
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.840
r plus one.

32
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.260
So we're going to the road that is after the last row,

33
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.470
and then comma one equals I be underscore i d.

34
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.030
And then there is another variable here called I Be Underscore name that is going to

35
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.820
contain the employee's name.

36
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.240
When we get the input box that says,

37
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.710
Please enter the employee's name and then this is gonna be put on the same row in column B

38
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.710
.

39
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.130
And then there is another variable here called I Be underscore hiring dates,

40
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.750
which is going to contain the employees hiring date that we're gonna input into the input

41
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.490
box that says,

42
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.070
Please enter the employees hiring date and this is gonna be enters on the same row as well

43
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.310
in column C and then we're gonna have a message box asking us if we would like to add

44
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.150
another employee or not.

45
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
So we're gonna have a variable called answer.

46
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.970
And if the answer is yes,

47
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.740
VBS,

48
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.280
then we're gonna go to enter another employee,

49
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.750
which is just a point that we've created here at the beginning Enter another employee so as

50
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.210
to go back and get us about the next employees details.

51
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.300
And if the answer is no,

52
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.330
then we will just exit the macro using the exits of statement.

53
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.660
Okay,

54
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.560
so let's run the macro here and see how it's gonna go.

55
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.470
So if you run that,

56
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.590
please enter the employees.

57
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.580
I d Yes,

58
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.750
sir.

59
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.570
I'm gonna put five and then the employee's name.

60
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.780
So I'm gonna put John Doe and the hiring date,

61
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.780
and you can see her.

62
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.400
But please enter the employees hiring dates D d M M y y so as to enter in the international

63
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.010
form.

64
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.560
So say I want to enter the seventh of May 2016.

65
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.660
I'm gonna press okay here.

66
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.290
Would you like to add another employee?

67
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.720
I'm gonna click no for now and examine what's hopping here.

68
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.480
So you can see here.

69
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.770
Employee i d.

70
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.910
Five in column A and then John doling Selby to here in column B and then the hiring date

71
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.800
has been entered in the international for So it is here that the hiring date has been

72
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.600
entered in in the international form and it's not caused any problems for two reasons.

73
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.400
First of all,

74
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.640
my computer is formatted in the international form,

75
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.660
so the dates format on my computer is in the international form,

76
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.990
not the US form.

77
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.790
And the second thing is because we've declared the I B date variable as date.

78
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.100
Now,

79
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.260
if this variable is not declared as a date,

80
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.510
we're gonna have a problem.

81
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.020
So this is actually one of the benefits of declaring your variable.

82
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.650
So let's say we're not going to declare this variable,

83
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.100
okay?

84
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.460
We're just gonna leave it as a variant and try to run the macro again and see what happens

85
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.460
.

86
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.970
So employee i d to say I'm gonna put six the name that say's gonna be John Smith and then

87
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.030
the employees hiring the Let's say I want to put the 10th of May 2060 and let's see what's

88
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.920
gonna happen here.

89
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.640
You can see here.

90
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.130
It's not been added as the 10th of May spin at it is the fifth of October.

91
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.210
The reason for that is that when you enter a dates into an input box by default,

92
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.630
it's gonna be understood as the American form.

93
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.250
However,

94
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.690
when we had the variable I be underscored,

95
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.510
Date declared as a date,

96
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.430
it actually abided to the date format off my computer.

97
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.910
So this is why when we entered it the first time when we had the variable idea underscore

98
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.450
date declared as a date.

99
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.020
So when we had it like that,

100
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.800
it didn't cause any problems.

101
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.720
But then when we entered it with the i B date variable not declared,

102
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.930
it caused the problem.

103
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.800
So this is one advantage year of declaring your variables.
