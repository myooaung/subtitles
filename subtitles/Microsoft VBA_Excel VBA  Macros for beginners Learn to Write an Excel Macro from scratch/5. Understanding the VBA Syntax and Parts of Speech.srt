1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240
Hey,

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,550
guys,

3
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,230
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,360
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,640
we're going to speak about the V B a speech or the V B A syntax,

6
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,350
or how the V b A language is written so v b A is an object oriented language as we've

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,560
explained before,

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,230
and that means that objects or announce they come first.

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,890
So in order to understand the V b a syntax or how the V B A language is written,

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,040
we're gonna actually compare it to how the English language is written.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,220
So in English,

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,250
you would say,

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,500
kick the bowl.

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,230
However,

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,680
in VB a objects or announce our most important so they come first.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,850
So if you want to say kick the bowl using V B A,

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,130
you would put the noun first.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,900
So if you want to write a sentence using Vehbi,

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,350
eh,

20
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,430
you would write the noun first sowed right now ndadd verb or object dot method,

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,150
and therefore,

22
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,450
if you want to say kick the bull using the V B a syntax,

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,430
you would say bull dot kick.

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,670
So is it can see here.

25
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,330
The noun,

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,230
which is the bowl,

27
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,350
comes before the verb,

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,190
which is kicked.

29
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,300
Two.

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,590
It's a Boldak cake.

31
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,400
If you want to say in VB a Syntex,

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,630
some other examples as well that you would write using VB.

33
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,040
A Syntex is like dinner dot eat or car dot drive.

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,530
So if you want to open a workbook in V B A,

35
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,810
you would say workbook dot open.

36
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,300
If you want to activate a worksheet,

37
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:41,500
you would say worksheet dot Activate some examples of objects or announce in Excel Off

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:41,830
course,

39
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,540
or the cell is an object of workbook.

40
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,890
The worksheet a chart as well,

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,670
is an object,

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,940
and we've explained that before some examples as well off collection.

43
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,450
We've explained collections before in XlV b A.

44
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,630
So some examples of collections or they're considered as actually plural noun are the cells

45
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,270
collection,

46
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,150
which is a plural or it contains cells,

47
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,010
and also the Worksheets collection,

48
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,760
which contains worksheets and workbooks collection,

49
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,310
which contains all workbooks as well.

50
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,890
So we're just reiterating the idea of having collections in Excel VV eight.

51
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:28,520
Now we're speaking about collections because we want to speak about how to identify items

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,530
in a collection.

53
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,600
So if you've got a collection of items,

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,180
how do you identify a certain item in a collection to make sure that you use the right item

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,850
or the item that you intend to use.

56
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,130
So,

57
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,900
for example,

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,740
if you've got three bowls here,

59
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,730
we've got a soccer or a football bowl and we've got a bowling bull and we've got a

60
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,800
basketball.

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,770
So how do make sure that we kick the right bull,

62
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,450
which is,

63
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,880
if we're gonna kick a bull?

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,910
It should be the soccer bowl,

65
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,260
right?

66
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,970
We don't want to kick the bowling bowl,

67
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,790
and we don't want to kick the basketball.

68
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,490
So there are actually two ways of identifying an item in a collection.

69
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,270
There is a less used way in a less recommended way,

70
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,590
which is using the index number,

71
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,210
and although it's a less used way,

72
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,860
you will use it sometimes.

73
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,490
But you're not going to use a lot as the other way,

74
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,740
and the other way is using the name.

75
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,530
But let's speak about using the index number first.

76
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,470
So if you wanna use the index number and you want to kick the first bowl in this collection

77
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,580
and the first is basically counting from left to right,

78
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,560
then you would right.

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,420
Bulls won dot kick,

80
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,920
so if you right bulls won dot kick.

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,780
This way you will be able to kick the soccer bowl.

82
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,950
However,

83
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,810
what happens if these Bulls got reordered?

84
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:02,210
And that means what happens if one of your friends puts the bowling bowl to be the first

85
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,970
bowl from the left hand side and you right?

86
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,050
Bulls won dot kick and you kick the bowling bull.

87
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,650
Ouch.

88
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,920
That's gonna be a painful experience,

89
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,250
right?

90
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,020
It's gonna be very painful to kick a bowling ball.

91
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:28,300
So this is why it is not recommended to use the index number to identify an item in a

92
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,000
collection.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So the better way is to actually use the name of the object.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,400
So it's better to write roles.

95
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,790
Soccer dot So if you do that,

96
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,770
you will make sure to kick the correct bull,

97
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,110
which is the soccer Bowl,

98
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,600
regardless of its position in this collection.

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,360
So if the soccer bowl is the first or the second or the third,

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,050
you're going to make sure that the soccer bowl is the bull you kick.

101
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,550
Okay,

102
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,180
so it's better to use the name of the item rather than its position.

103
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,150
Now let's speak about methods or verbs,

104
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:16,650
so methods in XlV be a or verbs have actually parameters and parameters act like adverbs in

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,710
the English language.

106
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,310
So if you say Bulls soccer dot kick and then you would right direction,

107
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,830
Colin equals right force Colin equals hard.

108
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:35,520
The direction and the force are considered parameters or adverbs in XlV v A,

109
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,650
and they describe how the verb or the method which is kick is done.

110
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:48,350
So here were saying that we want to kick the bull to the right and with the hard force.

111
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,820
So if you see a call in equals operator,

112
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,390
this indicates that you've got an adverb or a parameter,

113
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,000
and parameters are.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,300
Adverbs can sometimes be confusing because if you know the default order off the adverbs,

115
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,990
you can leave off the name.

116
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,410
So if you know that the default order for the direction and the force are that the

117
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,680
direction comes first and then the force parameter the nuclear I,

118
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,970
instead of writing bulls sucker don't kick direction called equals right force calling

119
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,780
equals hard.

120
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,750
You could write bulls soccer dot kick right comma hard.

121
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,700
Of course,

122
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,990
we do not have a kick method in XlV B A,

123
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,760
and we do not have a direction and a force parameters,

124
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,590
but you get the idea.

125
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,580
So in V B A,

126
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,520
you could write shapes that at shape.

127
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,160
So we're using the ad shape method on the shapes collection object in order to add a new

128
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,740
shape,

129
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,690
and then you would right left call unequal stand top Colin equals 20 with Colin equals 30.

130
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,430
Height colony equals 15 and these parameters are adverbs identified.

131
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:08,930
The position off the shape when it is inserted so you can actually write shape.

132
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,500
Start at shape 10 comma 20 comma,

133
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,910
100 comma 15 without explicitly writing the parameters and it will still work.

134
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,320
Okay,

135
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,020
the code will work absolutely fine.

136
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,960
However,

137
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,010
if you do that,

138
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,230
if you write the code without explicitly writing the parameters,

139
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,930
the code will be confusing,

140
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,350
right?

141
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,350
If someone else reads your code and you write shapes that at shape 10 common 20 comma 100

142
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,250
common 15.

143
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,940
If somebody reads your code this way,

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,130
they will be confused.

145
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:47,680
They will not understand what you mean because not everyone remembers the positions off the

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,510
parameters or the order of the parameters.

147
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:50,890
Right.

148
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:57,720
So writing the values of the parameters without specifying the actual parameters is a bad

149
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,550
programming practice So even though your code is still gonna work,

150
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,070
it is actually a about programming practice.

151
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,540
And it is better to explicitly right your parameters or adverbs.

152
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,820
Okay,

153
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,350
so we've spoken about parameters.

154
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,600
Now let's speak about properties or adjectives.

155
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,510
So properties,

156
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,900
what they do is that they describe an object.

157
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,020
So,

158
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,590
for example,

159
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,500
when you're I active,

160
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,930
she dot name equals my sheet.

161
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,530
The property name here gets the value off my sheet,

162
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,360
and that means that the name of the active sheet is gonna be my sheet.

163
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,170
And also,

164
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,750
properties do not use the colony equals construct.

165
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,270
Okay,

166
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,520
so the colony equals is exclusive for parameters.

167
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,200
So whenever you see a colony equals,

168
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,480
that means you've got a parameter here,

169
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,880
and you can set a variable equal to the value of a property.

170
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,490
So,

171
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,050
for example,

172
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,160
you can set variable X to be equal to the name of the active worksheet.

173
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,710
By writing X equals active,

174
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,850
she dot name,

175
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,170
and we will see how to do that in the future,

176
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,120
on the course as well.

177
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,770
Okay,

178
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,200
so let's summarize what we've explained on this video.

179
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:14,370
So a noun in the English language is equivalent to an object in XlV B A and a plural noun

180
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,860
is equivalent to a collection and think of different collections as different families.

181
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:28,200
A verb in the English language is equivalent to a method in XlV B A and an adverb is

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,260
equivalent to a parameter.

183
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:37,980
And also an adjective in the English language is equivalent to a property in XlV v a.

184
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,600
Okay,

185
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,220
so I hope that was informative for you about understanding the V b A Syntex.

186
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,110
Thank you very much,

187
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,380
guys,

188
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,500
