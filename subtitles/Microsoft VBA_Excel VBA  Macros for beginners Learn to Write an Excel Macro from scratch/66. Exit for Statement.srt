1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260
Hey,

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,550
guys,

3
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,290
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,800
So so far,

5
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,380
we've seen that the only way to exit a four loop is to actually reach the end for the

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,210
counter or to reach the lost pass in the loop or their loss.

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,900
It aeration.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,170
So,

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:16,760
for example,

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:24,570
for X equals 1 to 10 that means that the loop will not end unless we reach X To be equal to

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,990
10 we do the 10th pass or the 10th iteration through the loop.

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,760
However,

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,360
there is another way that you can exit a four loop at any point in the loop using the exit

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,770
for statement.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,460
Now,

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,180
we're gonna have an example here.

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,150
And although it's a trivial example,

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:51,440
a represents the case when you want to exit a four loop based on a certain condition and

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,790
you will not know when this condition is going to be satisfied or which inspiration it

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,610
could be satisfied.

21
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,470
In the first iteration on the 10th the duration,

22
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,420
you don't know,

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,210
he just want to exit the loop when this condition is satisfying.

24
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,350
Okay,

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,620
so this macro here that we're gonna have is going to represent that case.

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,350
So let's go through the macro here and know what it does.

27
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,720
So,

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,450
basically,

29
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,870
on column Max,

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:28,240
here I've put the values 12 30 in cells X one to X 30.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,470
The first step in this macro is that it's going to determine what the last row in column X

32
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,480
is which is gonna be row number 30 and then is going to say for I equals one to L.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,770
R.

34
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:48,620
And eyes basically our counter and our L R is going to be 30 at old times because the last

35
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,410
row and column axis 30 there's something that will not change.

36
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,210
First of all,

37
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,960
we're going to generate a random number,

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,560
and this random number is gonna be an integer between one and the value of the L R,

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,010
which is basically 30.

40
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,900
And I don't need you to worry about the four minute for generating this random number.

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,750
Okay,

42
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:18,090
I just want you to focus on the fact that this formula would just generate a random number

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,330
between one and the value of L.

44
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:21,550
R,

45
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:28,720
which is 30 and then we're basically going to start selecting the cell based on the

46
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,450
iteration loop.

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,990
So we're going to select cells.

48
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,650
I common 24.

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,910
So basically,

50
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,380
if we're in the first iteration.

51
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,090
We're going to select Sell X one.

52
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,440
If we're in the second iteration,

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,680
we're going to select Sell X two and so on and so forth.

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,600
And then we're gonna test if the value of the active cell is equal to the random number.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,360
And if that's the case,

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,860
we're going to get a message box that says we reached our goal after our situation.

57
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,280
So we're just gonna report that we reached our goal after I iterations and actually always

58
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
gonna be the number of the inspiration.

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,910
Basically,

60
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,700
this is why we put a variable for for this cause we don't know when we're going to reach

61
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,260
our goal.

62
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,060
And our goal is to basically have the value of the active cell equal to the random number

63
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,020
that we generated.

64
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,420
That is between one and 30 and then we're gonna exit for and this exit for statement.

65
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,340
What it does is a exits,

66
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,250
the four next loop,

67
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,930
and it works for the four each lupas Well,

68
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:34,000
that we're going to see in the future just gonna exit it and execute any statement after it

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
,

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,410
which in our case,

71
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,950
Siri's just gonna be the end sub statements so as to exit the macro.

72
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,140
However,

73
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,500
what happens if we don't reach our goal?

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,350
So if we go through all the 30 cells and we test the values in the 30 cells against the

75
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:58,580
random number and we never have a random number equal to the value of the current active

76
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,150
cell,

77
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,640
we're gonna have a message box.

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,250
We haven't reached our goal with a sad face here.

79
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,950
And then at this point,

80
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:12,410
because we're gonna have I to be equal to the value of the last year or I to be equal to 30

81
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:12,410
.

82
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,150
We're gonna have all our reiterations finished.

83
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:22,100
So we're basically gonna end if and actually there won't be any more passes or it orations

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,870
on the loop to do so.

85
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,510
Gonna execute any statement after the for next loop,

86
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,050
and it's gonna be the ends up statement and we're just gonna exit the macro.

87
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:38,160
So here the purpose of this micro this procedure is to show you the scenario when you're

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,010
going to do a loop and you wanna exit the loop based on a condition.

89
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,430
But you don't know when this condition is going to be satisfied,

90
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,070
and hence this is why we're generating around the number.

91
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,780
Okay,

92
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,570
So as to have the condition be satisfied at a point that you don't know when it's gonna be

93
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,350
satisfied.

94
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,350
Okay,

95
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,070
so you don't know on which pass off the loop or which alteration you're gonna have your

96
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,010
conditions satisfied.

97
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,720
And this why you're using is it for you testing for a condition and when it's satisfied to

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,150
use the exit for statement.

99
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,160
So start executing the macro here.

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,790
I'm gonna go through it step by step by using F eight on my keyboard.

101
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,640
So here,

102
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm going to get the value of the last row to be equal to 30 and then here is gonna before

103
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,070
I is equal to 12 thirties.

104
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,650
We're going to do 30 passes on this for next loop.

105
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,080
However,

106
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,090
with my exit,

107
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,940
if we satisfy her condition before the 30th pass or the 33 duration.

108
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,970
So now we're gonna generate a random number is trying to remember is 25 we're going to

109
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,240
select cells are common 24 which in this case,

110
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,210
because eyes equal to one is gonna be so x one and then we're gonna test is the value of

111
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,250
the actor cell equal to the random number.

112
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,130
The value of the active cell is one.

113
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,200
And the value of the run,

114
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,620
remember,

115
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,990
is equal to 25.

116
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,080
So they're not equal and a re on the loss situation.

117
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,270
No,

118
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,760
we're not.

119
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,880
So where we going to do?

120
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,150
We're just gonna go into another pass on the loop,

121
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,280
going to generate another random number.

122
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,050
It's 25 as well.

123
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,730
We're gonna test is equal to the value of the active cell.

124
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:15,970
No,

125
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,640
it is not.

126
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,000
So we're going to do again and keep on doing now.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,740
The active cell here is for and run the numbers 30.

128
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,280
So no actor sells five and render numbers 28.

129
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,210
So no.

130
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,410
Six and seven.

131
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:30,780
No,

132
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,800
they're not equal.

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,840
Seven and 21.

134
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,180
They're not equal nine and eight.

135
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,380
They are not equal 11 and four.

136
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,920
So we're going to keep on doing that until they become equal.

137
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,760
And they're still not equal on any pass.

138
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,090
See you guys,

139
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,900
the Rendon this factor here were generating random number,

140
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,860
and we don't know on which pass.

141
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,170
We're gonna have to exit the loop 23 10.

142
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,480
No,

143
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,450
they're not equal.

144
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,560
So here we have not reached our goal.

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,130
We've done 30 passes and we could not get the value of the active cell to be equal to the

146
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,500
random number so we can execute the macro again.

147
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,020
And it says again here,

148
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,310
After 30 passes,

149
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,850
we have not reached our goal.

150
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,500
And here we restart Goal after 11 alterations.

151
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,270
So you can see here the after 11 it rations.

152
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,550
We've managed to have a random number equal to the value of the active cell.

153
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,530
And what happened here is that a message box reached our goal.

154
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,640
Author 11 It's orations got executed.

155
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,910
And then we executed the exit for statement and we exited the loop basically,

156
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,600
and we executed the end sub which ends our macro.

157
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Okay,

158
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,610
so this macro,

159
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,520
although it is trivial,

160
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,940
it's a trivial example Over illustrates the run in this factor when you want to exit the

161
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,450
loop.

162
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,840
But you don't know on which iteration you're gonna need to exit that loop.

163
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,160
So I hope that illustrates the exits for statement for you.

164
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,450
It is used to basically exit your loop at any point,

165
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,420
and you can use it with a condition to exit a loop because you don't know on which it

166
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:19,780
aeration.

167
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,230
Exactly.

168
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,610
You're going to need to exit the loop this while you put a condition on.

169
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,460
Based upon that,

170
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,360
you execute the exit for a statement and you exit the loop.

171
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,980
OK,

172
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,300
so I hope that was informative for you.

173
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,700
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see you on the next one.
