00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Okay,

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:01,980
guys,

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,010
so so far in this course have been seeing code that would be executed on Lee ones.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,180
But what if we need to repeat our code?

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,580
Repeat,

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,120
executing our code over and over again.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,250
That's when we need to use a loop.

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,880
And a loop is basically a way for you to execute your code over and over again.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,840
But we're not gonna go through the code over and over again forever.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,960
There's gonna be a point when we would need to stop executing our code or else our macro

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,790
will go through an endless loop and will never stop.

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,260
Right?

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,430
So how you stop executing the code is determined by either the number of times that you've

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,270
asked Excel to repeat the code.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,600
So if you ask Excel to repeat the code for 10 times,

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,330
so Excel will stop executing the code after the 10th time.

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:53,710
Right?

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:01,110
Or you could ask Excel to keep on repeating the code until a certain condition is met and

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,820
when a sitting condition is met.

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,950
That's when Excel stops repeating the code that's called like exiting the loop,

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,000
and we'll see how to do that.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,850
So that guys was a quick introduction to Loops.

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,630
It's a way of repeating some code over and over again.

24
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,980
It saves a lot of time.

25
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,370
It adds a lot of power to your code,

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,060
and we will see how useful loops are on the upcoming videos.
