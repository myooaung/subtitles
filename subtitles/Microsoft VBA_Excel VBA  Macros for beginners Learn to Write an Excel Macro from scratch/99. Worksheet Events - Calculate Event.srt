1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
Hey,

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,110
guys,

3
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,690
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,760
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,330
we're going to discuss calculate event.

6
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:11,090
So the calculate event happens when you just calculate the values in your worksheet and the

7
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,910
values get calculated whenever he changes cell.

8
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,280
Okay?

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,730
And actually,

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,420
this happens for the whole workbook.

11
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:16,700
No,

12
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,650
just this particular sheet.

13
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,160
However,

14
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,840
you doing the event for for that particular sheet.

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,850
So we are on a sheet called calculate event and of gruesome random numbers here in Ah,

16
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,080
these cells okay.

17
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,050
And they're being generated by a function called ren between.

18
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,910
So this function will recalculate each time I changed the value of any other cell,

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,510
okay?

20
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,230
Or any cell actually in the workbook.

21
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,520
So if I just change the value of a cell,

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,100
numbers re calculate,

23
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,890
okay?

24
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,370
And now I'm also going to show you how you can calculate a sheet or a workbook as well,

25
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,590
so you can go to a former system on the ribbon click on calculate,

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,930
cheat,

27
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,420
and this will calculate your sheet If you click on calculate.

28
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,820
Now,

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,450
this will calculate your entire workbook,

30
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,920
which includes your sheet as well.

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,290
I don't typically have a lot of uses for the for this event.

32
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,300
Like I probably have never needed to use it.

33
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,970
But in case you need it,

34
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,160
it's there.

35
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,630
OK,

36
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,910
I'll show you as well the example that Microsoft ah ha's on their websites.

37
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,230
Okay,

38
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,350
so this is the example that Microsoft has on their website,

39
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,270
so he's actually just to oh,

40
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,900
to fit the columns A to F.

41
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,430
Whenever you do a calculation for the worksheet,

42
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,070
it's not particularly,

43
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,540
you know,

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,170
the best,

45
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,660
but we will try it.

46
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,510
So I'm gonna right click on the calculate event worksheet here,

47
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,810
click on view code,

48
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,350
and then I'm gonna goto worksheet and select the calculate event.

49
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,910
Okay,

50
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,250
And now we are in the worksheet calculate event,

51
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,990
okay?

52
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,510
And ah,

53
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,600
now let's run this.

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,850
Let's run this event.

55
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,580
So I'm just gonna change the value of any cell in this event.

56
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:02,920
Will run.

57
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,220
You can see here that Columns eight to have have had an odor fitting.

58
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,710
This is similar to selecting the columns here and double clicking on them.

59
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,100
And this will do the 02 fitting.

60
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,960
And also there is a recalculation done.

61
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,390
Okay.

62
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,150
And this will trigger your calculate event as well.

63
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:27,240
And one thing I want to tell you as well which is some sort of a word of caution.

64
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,540
You know,

65
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,190
this event will run whenever you do any sort of calculation on your workbook.

66
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,480
Ok?

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,230
Because your workbook were weak.

68
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,590
A candidate for any cell that you change the value off.

69
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,030
Okay,

70
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,420
so this event will got triggered a lot.

71
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,740
Okay,

72
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,100
so if you've got some sort of any looping code,

73
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,390
you know,

74
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,330
any code that would take time to execute any A code that has lots of actions.

75
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:49,660
Okay,

76
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,340
this could slow down your workbook.

77
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,710
I haven't needed to use it.

78
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,310
But if there is ah,

79
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,940
use for that event for you,

80
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,010
I would be interested to know it basically.

81
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,610
Okay,

82
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,390
so Ah,

83
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,150
thank you very much.

84
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,130
Watching this video I'll see on the next.
