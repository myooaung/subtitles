1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Hey,

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,790
guys,

3
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,420
Welcome back.

4
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,290
Soon this video,

5
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,330
we're going to discussed a before right click event.

6
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,720
So therefore right Click Event does the same thing as the before DoubleClick event,

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,040
except that it just triggers the code on right clicking instead of double clicking on a

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,570
cell.

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,250
Okay,

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,880
so what happens when you right click on a cell?

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,240
So I'm going to right click.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,680
So we get this menu.

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,580
This is what happens when you right click on a cell.

14
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,770
This is the default action.

15
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,240
OK,

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,960
so I'm going to right click here on my before,

17
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,390
right click worksheet and click on view code.

18
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,790
And then I'm going to select from this menu and select worksheet,

19
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,150
and I'm going to select it before Right click.

20
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:46,060
I'm just gonna delete here the selection change event and as you can see here,

21
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,260
is got two parameters.

22
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,800
The target as a range and the cancel as bullion.

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,720
So if you've guessed that the council would just disable the menu when right clicking Well

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:55,720
,

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,340
you did guess that true.

26
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,570
So let's say we want a message box to pop up on Lee.

27
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,060
If we right click on cell C three.

28
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,610
OK,

29
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,600
so we're going to do that.

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
So if Target,

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,890
I thought address.

32
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:18,170
And then I'm gonna put a full scum of false so that I can write the reference for the cell

33
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,250
without the dollar signs.

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,910
Okay.

35
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,720
Equals C three,

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,110
then message box.

37
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,390
You right?

38
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,050
Clicked cell C three.

39
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,670
Okay.

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,940
And if Ok,

41
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,880
so if I right click on any cell,

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,330
nothing's gonna happen.

43
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:36,640
Okay?

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,820
Just any other sell other than cell C three.

45
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,590
If I right click cell C three,

46
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:48,180
though you get the message box and notice here that has been executed before the default

47
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,280
action for right clicking,

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
which is viewing the menu.

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,930
Okay,

50
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,250
so it gets executed before viewing the menu.

51
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,060
Whatever code you right gets executed before the menu pops up.

52
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,480
Okay,

53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,960
so what if I don't want the menu to pop up?

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,400
Well,

55
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,200
if you've guessed that we need to put a cancel,

56
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,680
the council equals true,

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,230
which is ah,

58
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:16,980
similar to what we've done on the double click to in order not to enter the cell editing

59
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,410
mode.

60
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:17,800
Well,

61
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,720
that is true.

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,200
Okay,

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,560
So we need to put the council equals true.

64
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,350
If we put the council equals true,

65
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,480
we right click,

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,870
and then you get the message box or whatever code you've written executed.

67
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,270
However you don't get the menu.

68
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,850
Okay,

69
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,440
so it works the same way.

70
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,050
Justus.

71
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,070
Double clicking.

72
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,040
Except it's for right clicking.

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,720
Okay,

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,470
so you can do some.

75
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,730
Ah,

76
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,020
nice stuff with that.

77
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,070
You could maybe have a ah,

78
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,880
form control.

79
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,550
Pop up whenever you right click or something like that.

80
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay,

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,700
so that's it for the before,

82
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,700
right click events.

83
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,570
Very easy.

84
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,520
And I'll see you on the next.
