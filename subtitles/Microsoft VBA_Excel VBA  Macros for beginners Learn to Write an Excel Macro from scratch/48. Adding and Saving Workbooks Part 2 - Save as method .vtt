00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
Hey,

2
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.680
guys,

3
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome back in this video,

4
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.130
we're going to discuss the workbook dot save as method.

5
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.070
So the workbook does save as method allows us to save a newly created workbook to a certain

6
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.900
location and what we're going to do here,

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.670
we're gonna add a new workbook and try to save it.

8
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.850
So first of all,

9
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.490
we're gonna use this statement here workbooks,

10
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.460
that Otto adding new workbook or to creating you workbook.

11
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.580
And this is similar to pressing control and end on your keyboard on then active workbook to

12
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.350
save eyes to save the workbook.

13
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.650
So let's go through these lines of code step by step by pressing F eight on our keyboard.

14
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.230
So now we've added a new workbook.

15
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.620
And the reason I've used active workbook here is because when you create a new workbook,

16
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.280
it becomes the active workbook.

17
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.730
So you can see when we executed the first statement,

18
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.880
workbooks that add a new workbook was added here with the name of book one.

19
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.940
So if we execute this statement here right away and we haven't provided the location or

20
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.450
anything,

21
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.640
you can see that the statement went through fine and actually this workbook book one has

22
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.320
been saved.

23
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.110
It's been saved,

24
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.610
actually,

25
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.280
in the default location for saving workbooks,

26
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.510
which is actually my documents folder as well.

27
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.730
So if you check that,

28
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.390
you can see her.

29
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.160
That book one has been saved in the Documents folder.

30
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.240
Of course,

31
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.490
this is not the recommended way of doing it,

32
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.840
because it is better to provide a location and a fall for Mitt.

33
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.530
So actually,

34
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.210
I'd recommend would use the save as method to always specify a file name and a fall for

35
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.380
Mitt.

36
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.030
And I'll tell you why in just a second.

37
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.870
So actually,

38
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.830
in the fall name parameter here,

39
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.890
you need to provide the full path for the directory or for the folder that you need to save

40
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.890
the file in.

41
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.750
And you need to also include the file name and its extension as well.

42
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.480
So say I'm gonna save it,

43
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.820
actually,

44
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.960
to the test folder on my desktop.

45
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.250
I'm going to call it test,

46
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.380
and its extension is gonna be actually dot XLs m.

47
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.780
Okay,

48
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.570
so I have closed book one that we had safe to the Documents folder,

49
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.490
and I'm gonna execute the code again and watch what happens now when I actually provide the

50
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.030
file name and do not provide the file format parameter.

51
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.500
It's actually now a new book has been open here book to.

52
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.720
So if I try to say that it actually does not save and it says the extension cannot be used

53
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.060
with the selected file type,

54
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.840
change the file extension the foul named textbooks or select a different file types by

55
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.450
changing the save as type.

56
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.690
So because I have no provided the fall format parameter,

57
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.310
I got an error and actually sometimes and don't get an error.

58
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.660
If actually the extension I'm saving with is the same as the default extension for Excel

59
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.750
that I've set in the Excel settings,

60
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.840
which you can set actually by going to file and then options and then save okay.

61
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.260
And this is actually the default extension.

62
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.700
And although the default extension is the same,

63
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.920
it has not saved,

64
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.780
but sometimes actually saves.

65
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.570
But this is why you need to actually develop a habit of always using the file format

66
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.600
parameter as this will save you any problems.

67
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.340
So you need to make sure to use the file format parameter all the time and to determine the

68
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.610
valid values for the file format parameter.

69
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.520
You can actually go to the workbook that save as page on MSD on on the Microsoft Directory

70
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.100
Network by highlighting this active workbook that say Vows and President F one on your

71
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.610
keyboard.

72
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.500
Or you can just Google work booked up,

73
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.950
save as method mst n,

74
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.440
and you should be able to reach that page.

75
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.930
So let's go to the page on the Microsoft Directory Network.

76
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.490
So I'm going to highlight that I'm press F one on my keyboard case.

77
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.230
So we're now on the workbook to save as method page on the Microsoft Directory Network.

78
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.180
And actually,

79
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.910
you can see here here is a fall format parameter.

80
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.390
And here,

81
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.770
if you click on this link here Excel file format,

82
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.910
you're gonna be brought to the page that contains all the fall form it's that you can put

83
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.120
into that parameter.

84
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.000
So here are all the file formats that you can put.

85
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.530
Okay,

86
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.970
these air,

87
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.460
the excel far formance.

88
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.050
You can either input the name or you can input the value.

89
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.630
Okay,

90
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.710
so you can either inputs,

91
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.230
for example,

92
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.570
excel Adan or input 18.

93
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.520
Okay,

94
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:28.250
so one of the famous ones that you would use a lot is the macro enabled workbook,

95
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.560
the the Excel macro enabled workbook.

96
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.730
It's called Excel Open XML workbook macro enabled.

97
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.650
This is the one.

98
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.750
Or you could also input 52.

99
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.070
That would work as well.

100
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.150
So I'm just gonna copy that here.

101
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.350
I'm gonna have back to my visual Basic editor.

102
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.830
Okay,

103
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.150
so I'm back on the visual basic editor and have pasted the value for the fall format

104
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.330
parameter here and now,

105
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.560
if you tried to run the code on step through it,

106
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.550
step by step.

107
00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:03.100
So workbooks that ad and then active workbook to save as with that destination and with

108
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.190
that fall format.

109
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.260
And you can see here that the code has run fine and we've been able to save the fall.

110
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.050
So let's check our best folder on my desktop.

111
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.360
Okay,

112
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.050
So here is that just folder on my desktop and you can see here we've been able to save the

113
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.520
fall,

114
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.260
and it's type is a Microsoft Excel macro enabled worksheet.

115
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.950
Okay,

116
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.210
guys.

117
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.580
So I want to explain more parameters on the save as method.

118
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.030
So,

119
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.380
actually,

120
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.420
you can see here that this code is taking so long,

121
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.970
it's so horizontally.

122
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.290
It's taking a lot of real estate is.

123
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.460
Actually I can go to a new line and still type parameters into the save as method by

124
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.420
pressing space and then an underscore.

125
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.100
And then I compress enter to go to a new line.

126
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.670
And now,

127
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.180
Aiken,

128
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.240
continue typing into the save as method in the new line.

129
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.630
So it's a space and then an underscore,

130
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.260
and then you press enter.

131
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.240
And now we are in a new line.

132
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.550
But we're still typing values into the parameters for the workbook that save as method as

133
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.190
you can see her.

134
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.470
Okay,

135
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.730
guys.

136
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.970
So now we're gonna explain another parameter,

137
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.460
which is the password permit,

138
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.640
Er,

139
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.550
And as its name implies,

140
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.190
this parameter allows you to create a password for you workbook.

141
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.480
So if use the pastor parameter here,

142
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.930
password,

143
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.610
colon equals and then you need to write you password as strings units right at between.

144
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.340
Double quotes says say,

145
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.360
I'm gonna make it V b a course.

146
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.650
That's gonna be my password.

147
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.490
And this password,

148
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.650
this case sensitive.

149
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.870
And that means that you need to stick to the same casing for the letters that you've tight

150
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.620
the first time.

151
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.350
So,

152
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.030
for example,

153
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.280
V.

154
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.880
B a and the letter C need to be written in capital letters.

155
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.880
And the rest of the letters need to be written as small letters.

156
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.200
Okay,

157
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.710
so I say I'm going to save my file with a password of V B A course.

158
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.780
And I'm gonna make the file name to be password in the same location,

159
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.000
which is my best holder.

160
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.510
So if I run this macro,

161
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.040
the file will be saved in that folder with the password,

162
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.160
which is V B A course.

163
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.800
So let's check that out.

164
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.120
OK,

165
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.140
so here is my password file here.

166
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.340
So if I open it,

167
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.350
you can see her that is studying this special protected.

168
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.440
And I need to type in a password.

169
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.350
So if type of password and I'm able to access the file,

170
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.920
this is what the password parameter does.

171
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.780
So I'm gonna close the foul here.

172
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.220
Gonna go back to my visual basic editor.

173
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.600
Now we're gonna explain another parameter,

174
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.500
which is the right rez password,

175
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.400
which basically restricts writing to your file.

176
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.920
So that means that no one can make changes in your file unless he types of password.

177
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.550
So the first password parameter that we've just explained here.

178
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.940
This denies any access to your fall,

179
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.300
except if you type the password.

180
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.030
But this one the right rez.

181
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:56.980
Passwords,

182
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.670
writing restriction password.

183
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.850
This actually allows people to access the file,

184
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.760
even if they don't type the password.

185
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.740
So they there is a read only option.

186
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.610
But if they don't type the password,

187
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.720
they won't be able to change anything in the file.

188
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.100
They can read its contents,

189
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.030
but they cannot change anything.

190
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.680
Okay,

191
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.890
so they say I'm gonna make the password,

192
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.220
writes rez,

193
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:19.910
for example.

194
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.200
Like,

195
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.800
that is gonna be my password.

196
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.260
And the final name are going to make it right.

197
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.180
Rez is well,

198
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.840
and I'm actually going to remove this spots for parameter here to say I'm just gonna create

199
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.250
ah,

200
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.070
writing restriction password only.

201
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.050
And if I run this macro,

202
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.830
this is actually going to save my file with the name right Trez and with the writing

203
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.570
restriction password as well.

204
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.460
So let's check that file.

205
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.000
Okay,

206
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.240
guys.

207
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.530
So here is my file here.

208
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.470
I'm going to open it,

209
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:54.910
and it's gonna tell me that I can Onley open it as a read only if I don't type the pastor.

210
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.360
But if I need to have write access.

211
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.270
So if I need to have editing access to be able to enter the final,

212
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.860
I need to type this past richer.

213
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.580
If I type it,

214
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:11.830
I'm able to edit the file and I'm able to save it as well.

215
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.560
See what have edited.

216
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.450
But let's just close it and reopen it again.

217
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.650
Alright,

218
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:17.860
guys.

219
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.360
So have reopened again.

220
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.390
And if I ask for a read only access on,

221
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.860
I try to edit in the file and try to save it.

222
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.830
It tells me that I cannot save it,

223
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.820
because if I was to read on Lee and it actually prompts me to save another copy off it,

224
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.430
I cannot save my changes on the same copy so I can go to the browser and start saving as

225
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.850
usual.

226
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.590
Okay,

227
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.820
guys.

228
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:46.600
So we're not gonna go into the rest off the parameters because these air actually more than

229
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.780
enough for a beginner in V.

230
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:48.950
B.

231
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:49.240
A.

232
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.650
I'm actually going to include also a link for a block posts that actually explains the rest

233
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.550
of the parameters,

234
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.470
though they are not as important and you probably won't use them,

235
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:06.510
especially if you're a beginner and xlv b a and you're still trying to learn XlV b A.

236
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.610
So,

237
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.010
actually,

238
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.720
these parameters that we've explained are more than enough for a beginner,

239
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.190
which is actually what this courses started it for.

240
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.800
This course is started it for beginners.

241
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.930
So that's it,

242
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:19.280
guys,

243
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.630
for the workbook to save as method.

244
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.650
Thank you very much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
