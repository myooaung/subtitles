00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
Hey,

2
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:00.810
guys,

3
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.430
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.410
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.630
we're going to speak about the if then else statement.

6
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.750
So we're going to kick our game a notch higher and add an else clause to the if statement

7
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:21.720
on the else clause basically marks the start of another set of code that is executed in

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.060
case the condition is not true,

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.350
in case that the condition is false than the other set of code gets executed.

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.480
So basically,

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.910
the structure off the if then else statement is that if condition is equal to true than

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.210
execute code one So this is the first set of code that is going to be executed in case that

13
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.820
a condition is equal to two.

14
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.950
And of course,

15
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.590
this goat could be several lines of code.

16
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.200
Basically,

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.950
it shouldn't be just one line.

18
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.350
And if the condition is fools,

19
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.490
it's actually going to go straight away without any testing without any verification and

20
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.350
just execute code to face of the condition is false.

21
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.850
Co two will be executed,

22
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.350
no questions asked.

23
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.600
And then we've got our end.

24
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.050
If that marks the end of the if statement.

25
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.860
Okay,

26
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.260
so now we're gonna have an example for the if then else statement.

27
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.990
So actually gonna have the same example here as the one that we've had on the If statement

28
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.460
is just that we've added some code to be executed in case of the else clause.

29
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.540
So in case that this condition is false,

30
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.400
which is active cell that values greater than or equal to sail Stargate in case that is

31
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.050
false,

32
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.800
what's after?

33
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.270
The else clause will be executed and it will be executed straightaway without any kind of

34
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.230
verification.

35
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.140
We're not gonna tested condition or anything.

36
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.050
It's just gonna be executed,

37
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.830
no questions asked.

38
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.370
So I've got here the sales amount for Jennifer,

39
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.110
for example,

40
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.860
selected.

41
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.840
And now if I try to step through the code step by stuck by pressing F eight on my keyboard

42
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.830
because here that when we test the condition,

43
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.600
actually Jennifer has achieved the target,

44
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.120
and the code that it gets executed is the one that is associated with the condition being

45
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.730
true.

46
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.880
Now if we take Jack,

47
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.600
for example,

48
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.620
who has not achieved the target and try to run the macro for Jack because here,

49
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.000
when we test the condition,

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.110
Active said that values greater than equal to sail started,

51
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.150
He's gonna be fulls,

52
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.560
so it's gonna go to the L straight away.

53
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.470
It won't us conditions or anything.

54
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.300
You will just straight away go execute the other message boxes,

55
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.750
says Jack has not achieved the target.

56
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.920
So that's basically it for the F.

57
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.510
Then else statement,

58
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.320
you add an else clause.

59
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.250
This else clause will have some code,

60
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.550
and this code will be executed straight away.

61
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.580
If your condition is false,

62
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.210
it will be executed without any kind of testing.

63
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.190
It'll be just executed straight away.

64
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.740
So that's it,

65
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.020
guys,

66
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.200
for the if then else statement on the upcoming videos,

67
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.410
we're going to expand more on the if statement.

68
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.670
Thank you very much for watching this video on.

69
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.100
I'll see on the next one.
