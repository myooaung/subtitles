00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.240
Hey,

2
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.520
guys,

3
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.230
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.470
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.820
we're going to discuss one way of interacting with users in xlv B A,

6
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.440
which is using message boxes.

7
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.310
So we've actually been using message boxes since the start of the course,

8
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.130
however,

9
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.280
would been using them in their simplest form,

10
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.780
having on Lee a prompt or a main message.

11
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.100
And the problem is basically this message here that appears in the middle of the message

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.480
box.

13
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.760
So we've been using it in its simplest form.

14
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.410
We haven't explained how to use all its features and how to customize it,

15
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.970
to suit urinates and to have a fully customizable message box.

16
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.740
So this is what we're going to discuss in this video and in the upcoming couple videos as

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.120
well.

18
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.550
Okay,

19
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.870
so let's quickly go over the anatomy of a message box so a message box will usually contain

20
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.130
a title and a prompt.

21
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.290
And some buttons and parts of the buttons actually are your signs as well.

22
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.900
So you have some signs years,

23
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.090
which is the VB critical sign The exclamation signed the question mark sign or the question

24
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.060
VB question sign and the VB information science.

25
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.390
This is actually part of the buttons argument.

26
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.340
So let's discuss the syntax of a message box.

27
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.870
All the message boxes a function and it actually takes five arguments or five inputs.

28
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.090
But we're only discussing the 1st 3 because the loss to are actually obsolete.

29
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.270
They are not working on Excel versions after 2003.

30
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.590
So well,

31
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.860
not gonna bother with them.

32
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.320
So the first input is basically the prompt,

33
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.860
and the prompt is the main message that you need to display in the message box.

34
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.950
This is the prompt.

35
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.710
And this is what we've been using since the start of the course.

36
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.480
This is the only feature of the message box that we've been using the main message.

37
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.740
So this is the only input.

38
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.740
The is mandatory that you need to input on the message box.

39
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.300
So all the other inputs are actually optional.

40
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.100
There's also the buttons,

41
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.220
and the buttons are basically these buttons here that can be displayed on a message box.

42
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.150
By default,

43
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.220
it will have an O.

44
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.430
K.

45
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.810
Button,

46
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.240
but you can also have an abort,

47
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.730
retry and ignore button.

48
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.860
You can have OK and cancel.

49
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.240
You can have yes and no,

50
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.960
you can also have yes,

51
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.310
no,

52
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.450
and cancel is well,

53
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.780
so you can have different configurations are buttons and also on the buttons argument.

54
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.400
You can control the sign,

55
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.790
and we will see how to do that as well.

56
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.180
There is also the title argument,

57
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.630
which basically controls the title on the message box.

58
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.750
This is the title here.

59
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.600
You can put any title that you would like.

60
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.990
So here,

61
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.500
for example,

62
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.110
in this message box the prompter,

63
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.160
the main message says,

64
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.520
Let's go shopping So the title is shopping.

65
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.820
The title should normally be related to the main message,

66
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.330
but you can put any title that you want in any main message that you want as well.

67
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.750
OK,

68
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.050
guys.

69
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.100
So this was a quick introduction about message boxes in the upcoming videos.

70
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.900
We're going to dig deeper into message boxes,

71
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.310
so thanks for watching.

72
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.390
I'll see on the next video.
