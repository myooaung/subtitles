00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.410
Okay,

2
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:00.650
guys.

3
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.110
So let's start learning about events.

4
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.340
So we're actually going to start with worksheet events and worshipped events are basically

5
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.310
vb a code that gets triggered based on stuff that happened in your worksheet or to your

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.900
worksheet.

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.250
Okay.

8
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.400
So,

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.930
for example,

10
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.660
when you select a different cell in your worksheet when you de select your worksheets and

11
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.190
select another work sheet when you select your worksheet,

12
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.650
Okay.

13
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.210
And there are other events as well,

14
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.840
that can get VB a code triggered by Okay,

15
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.490
so let's see how we can start writing event procedures.

16
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.070
Basically.

17
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.260
So where do we write the this re be a code in order for all this magic to happen.

18
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.490
Okay,

19
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.480
so what do you need to do is to go to the value per tab on the ribbon and click on visual

20
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.940
basic.

21
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.900
Okay.

22
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.990
And then,

23
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.580
in order to write VB a code that would be executed based on stuff that happened in a

24
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.940
certain cheat or to a certain sheep,

25
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.800
you to double click on that sheet so you can see her.

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.860
We've got a workbook.

27
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.320
This cold worksheet events,

28
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.850
okay.

29
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.260
And they're the objects on the workbook.

30
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.680
Witcher.

31
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.350
There's there the sheets.

32
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.150
And there's this workbook which is really to too workbook events that we're going to speak

33
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.640
about a later on.

34
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.150
OK,

35
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.030
but what you need to do is to double click,

36
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
actually on the sheet that you need the events or the V B A coat too.

37
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.660
Execute or get executed based on stuff that happened in that work Sheep.

38
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.350
Okay,

39
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.500
so I need to write VB a code that would get executed based on things that would happen in

40
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.840
sheet one or two.

41
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.890
Sheet one.

42
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.250
OK,

43
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.810
so I'm going to double click on it here,

44
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.590
and what I need to do as well is in this drop down menu.

45
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.940
Instead of selecting General,

46
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.650
I need to select work sheep,

47
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.210
and you can see here that I've got some BB a code and this is actually a procedure an event

48
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.250
procedure that gets inserted here.

49
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.410
Okay,

50
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.450
So between the private sub and the end sub that gets guts inserted Ah,

51
00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.950
automatically by excel,

52
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.140
you actually write your code,

53
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.340
the in that you need to be executed based on stuff that would happen,

54
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.750
Ok,

55
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.420
and actually,

56
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.050
what we're going to start with is the selection change event.

57
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.580
Okay,

58
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.610
so you can see here on this,

59
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.150
Um,

60
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.600
on this drop down menu,

61
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.840
you've got the selection change.

62
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.040
But you can choose any event that you would like.

63
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.480
Okay,

64
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.700
So the selection change event,

65
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.190
what it does is that it makes you able to execute VB a code based on selecting a different

66
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.270
cell in your worksheet.

67
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.630
Okay,

68
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.440
so whenever you select a different cell in your worksheet,

69
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.260
this code will be executed.

70
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.070
Okay,

71
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.400
so let's see how that works.

72
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.740
Okay.

73
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.630
So for example,

74
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.980
here,

75
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.710
I'm just gonna write a message box.

76
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.350
A very simple message box.

77
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.990
You have triggered a selection change event.

78
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.460
Okay,

79
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.630
This is a very simple message,

80
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.800
boss,

81
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.200
because I want to show you how it works.

82
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.690
Basically,

83
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.550
it's very simple.

84
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.360
You have a certain self selected at the moment.

85
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.650
Okay,

86
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.690
Select another cell,

87
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.870
and that gets triggered.

88
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.340
Select another cell,

89
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.850
and the message box gets triggered,

90
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.300
or whatever code you write gets triggered.

91
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.630
Okay,

92
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.650
so it's very it's a very simple one.

93
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.020
Okay,

94
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.270
guys.

95
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.670
So you probably noticed and have been curious about what's written between brackets here,

96
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.190
which is by Val Target as range on.

97
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.990
What that means is that you've got a parameter that is cool target.

98
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.650
Okay,

99
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.270
that has the object type of a range.

100
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.560
Okay,

101
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.660
so it's it's it's a range object.

102
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.220
So it has all the properties and the message methods for a range object.

103
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.800
Okay.

104
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.790
And what the target range object refers to is that it refers to the cell that you would

105
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.310
select.

106
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.750
Okay,

107
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.580
So any cell that you select,

108
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.760
you can refer to it as target.

109
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.540
Okay.

110
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.750
And we're going to see how we can ah,

111
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.760
leverage that.

112
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.980
So,

113
00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.640
for example,

114
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.580
let's say I want to have a message box that would tell me whenever a select a cell,

115
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.070
it would tell me the name of the cell the I selected.

116
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.180
So it told me you select to tell a to you selected Selby three.

117
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.980
Whatever.

118
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.350
Okay,

119
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.070
so I'll have a message box,

120
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.080
you have selected cell and then a space here,

121
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.430
and then I'll close the double quotes,

122
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.060
and then a 9% and then I'm gonna put target dot address.

123
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.530
Okay.

124
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.610
So what that will do is that you will just tell me what cell I selected,

125
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.060
remember?

126
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.440
Remember,

127
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.680
guys,

128
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.290
the target dot address property.

129
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.950
Okay,

130
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.210
So I've selected Selby six year and tells me selected Selby six here.

131
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.560
It tells me selected Cell J five and then sell Jay 11.

132
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.050
So whenever a select to sell,

133
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.490
it would just give me a message box telling me you have selected that cell,

134
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.050
Okay.

135
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.010
And,

136
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.330
ah,

137
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.950
you could see her that we've got the dollar signs here.

138
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.190
And we've everything absolutely.

139
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.100
On the reference so we can actually fix that by remember,

140
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.400
guys.

141
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.190
When we spoke about the inputs for the target address property,

142
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.130
we can actually make the rule.

143
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.120
Absolute falls.

144
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.830
And the column.

145
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.860
Absolute falls.

146
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.500
Okay,

147
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.500
so that we would have this appear in a more from the way.

148
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.100
So you have selected cell B six,

149
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.700
for example.

150
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.120
Okay,

151
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.140
So target refers to the cell that we have selected,

152
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.950
okay?

153
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.370
And you can see her that excel tells you the type of the object.

154
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.090
Okay,

155
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.740
that which is target.

156
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.160
Okay,

157
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.470
so that you can know if you know that it's type is arranged.

158
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.700
So you know that it has old the properties on the methods of a range objects,

159
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.950
so you can deal with it accordingly.

160
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.140
Okay,

161
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.360
guys.

162
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.640
So let's do something else with our event here,

163
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.350
maybe I would like any cell that I would select in this worksheet to turn red.

164
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.650
Okay,

165
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.890
so I would write Target Don Interior,

166
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:06.780
Dr.

167
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.450
Color.

168
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.210
A guy equals V b red.

169
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.110
Okay,

170
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.000
so this way any cell that I would select in this worksheet would turn red.

171
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.880
Okay,

172
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:25.290
how about if I want on Lee the cells that I would select in column A to turn red?

173
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.150
So how do we do that?

174
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.320
Okay,

175
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.220
so let's delete this line of code first roll,

176
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.510
and let's clear our read fillings here and let's go back.

177
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.420
And then we can actually use an if statement to do that.

178
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.710
Okay,

179
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:48.160
So if target dot column equals one,

180
00:06:48.160 --> 00:07:03.060
then target dot interior dot color equals VB bread.

181
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.290
Okay.

182
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.920
And if so,

183
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.150
that what this will do is that if the color off,

184
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.660
uh,

185
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.780
I'm sorry if if the column of the target cell is equal to one and that means that it's in

186
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.610
column a the color of the cell will turn red.

187
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.990
Okay,

188
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.750
so if I select a song column B c whatever,

189
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.570
it will not turn red.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.540
So any code that you would like Justus you're writing a normal procedure would work.

197
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.380
OK,

198
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.430
