00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.380
Okay,

2
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.650
guys.

3
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.730
So now we're gonna have an exercise for the input box.

4
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.830
So we're going to create an input box that prompts the user for his password.

5
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.140
So if the password entered is my password and this is case sensitive so he needs to enter

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.900
in this same casing,

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.180
then a message box will be displayed saying access granted and if the password entered is

8
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.920
incorrect.

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.210
So if enters an incorrect password or he enters a blank password or you or represses cancel

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.150
on the input box than a message box having guests,

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.300
no buttons and VB question will be displayed saying invalidpassword,

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.850
would you like to try again or try again?

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.440
And if the user clicks,

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.990
yes,

15
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.350
the user will be put back to the first input box and get prompted for its posture it again

16
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.350
.

17
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.360
And if the user clicks no,

18
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.250
then we exit the sub.

19
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.260
Now,

20
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.120
I'm gonna demonstrate that macro for you because I've got it already here answered.

21
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.090
And you can look at the answer if you get stuck.

22
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.220
So I'm gonna run it here.

23
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.910
So please enter you password.

24
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.310
If I enter an incorrect password here and click OK,

25
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.330
says invited Pastor,

26
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.440
do you like to try again?

27
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.010
If a click?

28
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.520
Yes,

29
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.400
I try again for entering invited password again and click.

30
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.850
No.

31
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.300
Try again and click.

32
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.680
No.

33
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.610
Then we exit the sub.

34
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.150
And if I enter the correct password here,

35
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.270
my password Correct one and click.

36
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.910
OK,

37
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.870
then access is granted.

38
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.340
So this is the functionality that I need you to create.

39
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.730
So please attempt the exercise.

40
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.840
And if you get stuck,

41
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.750
have a look at the answer here on this exercise answer module.

42
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.240
And if you have any questions,

43
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.080
please leave them in the Q and a section.

44
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.820
