00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,230
Hey,

2
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,500
guys,

3
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,060
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,990
So in this video,

5
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,850
we're going to speak about how to record a basic macro.

6
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:12,180
So in order to record a basic Makary need to go to the developer tab on the ribbon and then

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,150
click on record macro.

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,050
So this way you're able to record some actions and then play them back whenever you want.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,090
So as you can see here,

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,310
I've got a dollar box that enables me to name the macro so I can name it my micro,

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,100
for example.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,860
And the naming of the macro has some restrictions.

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,540
So,

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,530
for example,

15
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,940
you cannot put a space on the name of the micro.

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,600
So if I put a space here and click OK,

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,890
you're going to get this hour here.

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,050
The syntax of this name is not correct.

19
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,720
So basically,

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,970
you cannot put a space.

21
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,140
You cannot put an exclamation more a dollar sign.

22
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,040
So basically,

23
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,020
there are some signs here on the keyboard that you cannot use.

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,940
However,

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,760
you can actually use an underscore if you want to,

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,420
so I can emit my macro this way.

27
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,540
And here you can assign a short cut key so it can be control and any other key on the

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,150
keyboard and you can make it control and shifted.

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,970
And here,

30
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,850
for example,

31
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,670
also,

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,980
you have the option to store the macro either in this workbook,

33
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,380
which is this work with this currently open here in the school Book one or you can store in

34
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,170
a new workbook.

35
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,700
So this way,

36
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,610
if you click OK in,

37
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,850
your book will be open and the MCA will be stored in that workbook.

38
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,690
Or if you choose to store in the personal macro workbook this way it will be starting in a

39
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,610
workbook called the Personal Macro workbook.

40
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,980
And this enables you to have the macro available in each and every workbook that you open

41
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,860
in excel.

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,890
From now on,

43
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,670
I'm just gonna choose to start in this workbook and I'm gonna click.

44
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,350
OK,

45
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,670
so this way I've started recording the macro What I'm going to do.

46
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,310
I'm going to select cell a one and type my name and then press enter and then I'm going to

47
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,410
stop recording.

48
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,840
So now I've recorded a macro and only does is that it puts my name in cell a one.

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,850
Now to examine that macro,

50
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,060
you can go under the developer top here,

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,170
you can go to my crows and here on my macro,

52
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:15,050
you conclude con ed it and then you can have a look at the code of the recorded macro.

53
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,030
You can also click on old and F 11 on your keyboard.

54
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,700
And here on module one year you will find the macro.

55
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,470
And a module is basically a container for your Marko's.

56
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,940
Think about it this way.

57
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,180
We'll speak about it as well later on in the course.

58
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,530
Okay,

59
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:38,540
so we've recorded a macro and xlv B A has just recorded our actions and transformed them

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,970
into some code.

61
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,410
So now I can actually delete here the contents of cell a one.

62
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,240
And if I just go to Macron's again and here on my macro,

63
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,450
I click on Run the macro is going to run and is gonna put my name in cell a one.

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,340
So as you can see,

65
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,050
Your Excel just repeated our actions again.

66
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,160
And our actions here are to be secure so that sell anyone put my name in the cell and then

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,850
because when you press enter,

68
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,910
you go to the cell just below it.

69
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,620
So here we've gone to sell a to sell it to has been selected.

70
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,580
And if you do not understand what this code does,

71
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,790
do not worry.

72
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,710
By the end of the course,

73
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,200
or even by the middle of the course,

74
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,860
you be able to understand it perfectly fine.

75
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,470
So don't worry about the code at the moment,

76
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:23,800
OK,

77
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,700
one more thing I want to tell you as well is that if you need to save a workbook that

78
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,680
contains a micro's,

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,180
if I press controlling as to save my workbook here and here on save eyes,

80
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,560
if I click on browse,

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,190
you can see her.

82
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,590
I have the chance to save the workbook.

83
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,750
You need to make sure to save it as an excel macro enabled workbook.

84
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,070
You cannot save it as an Excel workbook because it normal Excel workbook will not save a

85
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,900
macro.

86
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,770
One more thing I want to show you as well is how you can assign a macro to a button or a

87
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,160
shape so you can insert a simple button here by going to the insert button here under the

88
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,380
developer tab and clicking on button.

89
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,390
And here you have a button,

90
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,270
and then if you click OK,

91
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,610
the button will be inserted.

92
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,210
So in order to assign the macro to that bun,

93
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,590
you can right click on the button itself and click on a sign macro,

94
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,780
and then assign your macro here that you recorded called my macro,

95
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,610
for example,

96
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,380
and then click.

97
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:20,940
OK,

98
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,570
And then whenever you press that,

99
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,280
bend them back,

100
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
crow is going to run.

101
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,040
You can also do it with the shape so it can insert any shape here,

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,980
insert a shape and then right click on it a sign,

103
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,970
macro and a sign the macro as well.

104
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:42,410
And this works with any form control here under the developer tab on the insert button here

105
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:49,020
so you can insert any active extra form control and then assigned the macro to that control

106
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,700
using the same way.

107
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,590
And if you need to edit the text inside so you can right click here,

108
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,780
click on edit text and you can at it the text as well.

109
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,350
Okay,

110
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,940
so that's it,

111
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,240
guys,

112
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,770
for recording a basic macro.

113
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,960
Thank you very much watching this video and I'll see you on the next one
