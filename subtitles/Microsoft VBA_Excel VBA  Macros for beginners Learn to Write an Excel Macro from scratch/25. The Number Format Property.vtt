00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.210
Hey,

2
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.550
guys,

3
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.130
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.920
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.200
we're going to speak about the range dot number format property.

6
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.100
So the number former property for the range object allows you to change the number for Mitt

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.780
of a cell using Excel VB eight.

8
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.980
And actually,

9
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.150
what the number for Mitt of a cell is is basically how the value in the cell looks.

10
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.650
OK,

11
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.930
so it does not change the value of a sell.

12
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.900
It just changes how it looks.

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.150
So,

14
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.890
for example,

15
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.880
here in the range cold my underscore table here I've put the value of 10 in all the cells

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.780
in the range.

17
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.260
I can actually give this,

18
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.060
for example,

19
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.050
a percentage number format.

20
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.510
Okay,

21
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.450
so click on this button here.

22
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.110
It's going to change the number format of the cell.

23
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.800
It's changed the 2% so it's now looking like 1000%.

24
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.370
It hasn't changed the value of the cell cause 1000% is still 10.

25
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.680
Okay,

26
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.350
cause 100% is a one.

27
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.260
So if you multiply that by 10 this give you 1000%.

28
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.170
So it actually has not changed the value of the cell.

29
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.610
The value off the cell is still 10.

30
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.390
However,

31
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.800
it just looks like 1000%.

32
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.450
Okay,

33
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.810
so to actually change the number format of a cell,

34
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.010
you can change one of these quick form.

35
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.250
It's available here in this list,

36
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.580
or you can actually highlight the cells and then right click,

37
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.970
click on form it sells.

38
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.160
Or alternatively,

39
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.090
you can actually press control and one on your keyboard.

40
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.250
And this will get you this same window here.

41
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.280
And as you can see here,

42
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.690
we've got different categories for number formats.

43
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.960
So we've gotten a number,

44
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.590
currency,

45
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.470
accounting date and time percentage fraction,

46
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.710
you know,

47
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.120
all kinds of number formers.

48
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.370
Let's say we're going to choose percentage,

49
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.840
and this is actually how you can apply here using the Excel environment so you can choose

50
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.210
one of these formats and press OK.

51
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.400
And there is also an option to use custom number formatting,

52
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.080
which is actually creating a custom format by yourself so you won't use one of these ready

53
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.890
made format.

54
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.150
You will create a custom number format by yourself.

55
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.990
And actually,

56
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.210
I've got a video posted on YouTube on my YouTube channel on custom number formatting eso,

57
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.750
how to create your own custom number format and one.

58
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.780
All these signs mean so what the pound sign means and what zero means and all that and a

59
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.670
question mark.

60
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.020
Okay,

61
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.410
so you can learn how to decipher these goes using that video,

62
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.220
I'd really recommend you check it out.

63
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.630
It's a 45 minute video.

64
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.680
It's a long video on.

65
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.420
I hope it would be useful for you.

66
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.450
It would be actually useful for any Excel user.

67
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.110
Okay,

68
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.720
anyways,

69
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.270
so to actually apply a custom number formatting in Excel,

70
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.370
you'd actually need to get the code for that number forming.

71
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.070
So the Cody's here in this type window,

72
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.010
and the code for the percentage number formatting that we've applied is this 0% code here,

73
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.650
So I'll just copy that,

74
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.810
and I'll press cancel here on my window.

75
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.950
I'll actually put it back to the general number format.

76
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.640
Okay,

77
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.340
so I'll just put it back to the default number format,

78
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.700
and I'll go back to my visual basic environment here,

79
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.090
And I've created a procedure cold number underscore format.

80
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.270
And in order to use the number format property,

81
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.870
you'd write the name of your range.

82
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.550
So range Molly underscore table dot number format equals,

83
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.050
and then you put your number for Mitt Between double quotes to here.

84
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.430
I've got my number format put between double quotes.

85
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.430
And if we run that you can see here the number format has been applied and you can apply

86
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.050
any number for men as long as you get its code.

87
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.460
I want to also show you a small detail here.

88
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.390
This a bit tricky.

89
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.200
Okay,

90
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.850
so if you apply a currency number for Mitt here,

91
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.100
so just apply this dollar currency number format and if you right click on it,

92
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.810
click on form,

93
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.870
It sells eggs.

94
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.310
Here.

95
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.010
Here is the number for Mitt applied.

96
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.530
I'll go to the custom tab here and you can see here that this number for Mitt actually

97
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.050
contains some double quotes,

98
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.720
as you can see here to double quotes having a small hyphen between them.

99
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.350
Okay,

100
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.950
so if you try to apply this number format using VB A I'll just copy here.

101
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.570
I'll press council here.

102
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.240
I'll go back to the general cause I wouldn't apply using Vehbi,

103
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.550
eh?

104
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.140
So go back to my visual basic environment.

105
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:36.710
And here if you copy and paste that between the double quotes and you try to run this code

106
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.160
you'll actually get in error.

107
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.300
Okay,

108
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.180
so why did we get an error here?

109
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.760
So press.

110
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.630
And here the reason for that is that we've got double quotes in the number format.

111
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.860
And when you have double quotes that you need to put between double quotes excel,

112
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.710
VB a will not recognize is that these are double course to be put between two double quotes

113
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.920
here.

114
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.640
So we need to put these double quotes between these two double quotes on the very right and

115
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.410
the very left.

116
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.650
So in order to make vb a recognized that these air actually double quotes because what V B

117
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.390
A would think is that actually,

118
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.480
this is the start of the double quotes here,

119
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.490
the one on the very left.

120
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.770
And then here you can see the first double quotes meets.

121
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.350
It will actually think that this is actually the end of the double quotes.

122
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.520
No,

123
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.800
actually,

124
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.140
double close to be put between double quotes.

125
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.870
I hope that you're getting what I mean.

126
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.850
Anyways,

127
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.430
you actually need to double the double quotes in the middle in order to make excel,

128
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.170
recognize that this is not the ending double quote.

129
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.960
This is not a closing double quote.

130
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.790
This is actually just double quotes,

131
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.410
you know,

132
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.150
in the middle.

133
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.630
And this is double quit in the middle.

134
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.430
And this is actually the closing double quote.

135
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.250
And this is your opening double quote.

136
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.910
So I hope you got the idea.

137
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.150
Now,

138
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.150
if you run that,

139
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.940
the micro will work just fine,

140
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.650
OK?

141
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.240
And of course,

142
00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.200
you can actually get the number format of a certain cell using the number format property

143
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.650
here,

144
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:07.370
So I can just copy this and put that in a message box.

145
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.930
I can just calm and that line of code in order for it not to run.

146
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.290
And if you run that,

147
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.670
you actually get the number format in a message box or cases.

148
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.640
You know how you can obtain the number for Mitt of his search and sell using V B A if you

149
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.170
want to.

150
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.780
Okay.

151
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.390
So Ah,

152
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.580
that's it for the range dot number.

153
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.450
Former property.

154
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.800
Guys,

155
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.150
thank you very much watching this video and I'll see on the next one
