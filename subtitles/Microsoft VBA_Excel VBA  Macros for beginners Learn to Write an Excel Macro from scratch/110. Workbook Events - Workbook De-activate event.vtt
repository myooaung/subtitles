Hey,

2
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.410
guys,

3
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.080
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.980
So in this video,

5
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.150
we're going to speak about the workbook deactivate event.

6
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.210
So the workbook deactivate event triggers whatever code you write in it whenever you

7
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.130
deactivate the workbook and go to another workbook,

8
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.510
Actually,

9
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.270
not to another application.

10
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.580
OK,

11
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.480
so it doesn't work If you deactivate,

12
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.370
excel and go to Microsoft Ward,

13
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.250
for example,

14
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.010
it works when you deactivate this excel workbook that has this particular event and go to

15
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.340
another Excel workbook so you can get it.

16
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:32.750
Of course,

17
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.110
by opening your VB a editor double clicking on this workbook here and selecting from this

18
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.570
menu selecting workbook and from this menu here,

19
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.800
you're gonna see select D activates.

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.270
Okay,

21
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.010
so I'm gonna to lead the workbook open,

22
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.990
and it's very simple.

23
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.360
It works whenever you deactivate your workbook.

24
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.730
OK,

25
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.860
so I'm just gonna have a message Box says looking forward to seeing you again.

26
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.840
So I'm gonna press control on N on my keyboard to open in your workbook.

27
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.730
And actually,

28
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.160
you know,

29
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.660
the moment I opened in your workbook,

30
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.930
the message box bumped up.

31
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.550
So I'm just gonna go back to my workbook again here and go to the new workbook that I had

32
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.200
open and you can see here Message box popped up.

33
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.120
Whatever code you put in there or whatever could we put in?

34
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.750
The event has been executed.

35
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.660
Okay,

36
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.910
guys.

37
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.470
So let's say for the workbook deactivate event,

38
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.490
it's very simple.

39
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.690
Just runs any code that you write in it whenever you deactivate the workbook that you've

40
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.300
written the event for and activate another Excel workbook.

41
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.770
OK,

42
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.080
just very mind that it runs when you activate another excel workbook,

43
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.350
not another application.

44
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.740
So be free to use your imagination and use that if an AnnTaylor to whatever application you

45
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.330
would like to use it for basically.

46
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.920
Okay,

47
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.070
So Ah,

48
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.120
thanks very much for watching this video guys on.

49
00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.450
I'll see you on the next one.
