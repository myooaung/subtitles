00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200
Hey,

2
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,520
guys,

3
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,150
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,080
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,810
we're going to speak about another structure that you can use as an alternative to,

6
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,940
if then else.

7
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,560
If which is using nested ifs,

8
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,070
however,

9
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,220
it's not recommended that used nested ifs as their execution time is higher or the coat

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,280
takes more to get executed.

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,450
But I'll just show it to you just for you to know it.

12
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,580
And in case you see on somebody else's code,

13
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,810
you'd understand what they're trying to do.

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,740
So basically,

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,810
I've got some code here written using Dennis it if structure and it's actually doing the

16
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:43,150
same thing as what we were doing on the if then else if sir testing the value on Selby 18

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:49,140
this cell here in green and we're checking the value.

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,900
And if the values one will get a message box one,

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,220
and if it's too,

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,890
we're gonna miss it.

21
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,230
Books,

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:54,620
too.

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,580
If it's three,

24
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,030
we got a message Box three,

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,320
and if it's forward,

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,170
get a message box.

27
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,910
So four.

28
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,970
And as you can see here,

29
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,300
this is the structure of the nested ifs.

30
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,440
The Necid ifs air basically,

31
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:13,320
and if condition and then on the els you put another if inside it.

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,910
Okay,

33
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,600
so he said if then else.

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,960
But in the else you don't put an action to be executed,

35
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,070
you actually nest another if inside the else.

36
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,900
Okay.

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,380
And so this if can also be accompanied by an else,

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,180
okay?

39
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,020
And then you can nest.

40
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,400
And if inside the else for the second if so,

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,460
this way you're creating nested ifs.

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,140
And then there's another.

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,460
If here in nested inside the els for that third if and so because now we've got,

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,720
like,

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,160
four ifs 1234 we would have to put four and if so,

46
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,070
this is why it's not recommended.

47
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,750
First of all,

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,780
it's complicated to right.

49
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,880
And the second thing is that the code will be executed in a longer time.

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,650
So if you touch this code,

51
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,620
for example,

52
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,090
let's say I'm gonna put the value here to be four,

53
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,890
for example.

54
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,450
So let's see how many steps it takes for us to reach the message box that says four.

55
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,110
So I'm gonna run through the code step by step.

56
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,270
Here,

57
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:27,490
212345 6789 10 11 12.

58
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,270
Okay,

59
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,930
so we've taken,

60
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,120
like,

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,780
12 steps to reach that message boxing and actually end all the end ifs.

62
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:42,160
But if we try to execute this goat here with if then else if it's 12345 six,

63
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,960
six steps,

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,870
seven with the end if,

65
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,350
okay,

66
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,250
so seven steps instead of 12.

67
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,670
This is why the if then else,

68
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,640
if structure is more efficient,

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,330
it executes the code in less time.

70
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:57,990
Okay,

71
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:04,090
so so in case that you can do something with the if then else if and you can do the same

72
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,920
thing with nested ifs,

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,460
it is recommended that used the if then else if structure and you can see her as well

74
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,950
because it's complicated to read the nested if structure,

75
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,770
you can see her them inventing my code here so as to make it easier to read.

76
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,660
So as you can see her putting the if and then I'm in vending the result and then the els.

77
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,960
But and then then thing,

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,740
the if inside the else to given indication that the if is nested inside the else on them,

79
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,610
doing indentations so as to make it easier to read,

80
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,830
but is already a bit complicated to right.

81
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,770
And it's not efficient in code execution in terms of execution time as well.

82
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,450
I mean,

83
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,700
because this is a small macro.

84
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,540
Probably you won't feel the difference.

85
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,910
But if you're doing something complicated using Vehbi,

86
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,300
eh,

87
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,930
there will be a difference in the execution time.

88
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,500
Okay,

89
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,060
So this is why this structure administrative structure is not recommended.

90
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,550
It is recommended that you stick to if then else if structure Ok,

91
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,020
so that's it,

92
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,320
guys,

93
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,650
for the necessity of structure just wanted you to be acquainted with it.

94
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,690
So as if you see it in somebody else's code,

95
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,590
you'd understand it.

96
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,100
Okay,

97
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,080
although it's not recommended to be used.

98
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,550
So thank you guys for watching this video and I'll see you on the next one.
