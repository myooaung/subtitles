00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
Okay,

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:00.810
guys.

3
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.670
So now we're going to speak about the worksheet.

4
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.120
Activate event,

5
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.810
okay?

6
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.840
And before we start speaking about it,

7
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.380
just want to tell you that I actually changed the name of the worksheet that was named

8
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.060
Cheat One.

9
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.450
When we were explaining the selection change event,

10
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.500
I renamed it the selection Change event.

11
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.910
Okay.

12
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.910
And,

13
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.220
ah,

14
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.500
let's speak about the worst seat.

15
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.790
Activate event.

16
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.260
Okay,

17
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.520
So,

18
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.940
weaken,

19
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.790
go to that event the same way.

20
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.420
Or actually,

21
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.530
there's another way to do it.

22
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.960
Which is,

23
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.040
boy right,

24
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.710
clicking on the worksheet itself that you need to create the event for and then click on

25
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.350
view code here.

26
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.280
Okay.

27
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.470
And,

28
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.710
ah,

29
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.200
Then from this menu,

30
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.650
you choose worksheet instead of general.

31
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.150
And then from this menu here on the right,

32
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.440
you choose Activate.

33
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.960
Okay.

34
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.800
I'm just gonna delete this election change because I'm not going to use it right now.

35
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.390
Okay,

36
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.710
so we are in the worksheet.

37
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.590
Activate event for the worksheet named work seat.

38
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.410
Activate.

39
00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.780
Okay.

40
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.430
So you can hear worksheet.

41
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.750
Activate is highlighted.

42
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.230
Where in the worksheet activate event.

43
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.760
So what this does is that it simply executes whatever code you right between the private

44
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.060
self and the end sub when you activate the worksheet.

45
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.580
Okay,

46
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.010
So for example,

47
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:27.430
we could have a message box you have triggered triggered the worksheet activate even.

48
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.050
Okay,

49
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.740
this is a message box.

50
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.230
This message box is going to appear whenever we activate the worksheet.

51
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.420
Activate worksheet.

52
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.850
Okay,

53
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.530
so I'm going to create a new sheet here.

54
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.110
I went to a new sheet,

55
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.730
and then I'm gonna go back to the worksheet,

56
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.950
activate and activated,

57
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.170
and you can see her that the event has been activated.

58
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.850
Okay,

59
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.920
so that's it.

60
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.900
It's very simple.

61
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.130
You activate the worksheet.

62
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.130
Whatever code you right between the private sub on the ends up for the worksheet.

63
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.600
Activate event gets executed.

64
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.320
Okay.

65
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.470
Okay,

66
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.720
guys.

67
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.720
So I want to show you,

68
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.350
actually.

69
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.360
Ah,

70
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.590
a practical application for the worksheet.

71
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.880
Activate event.

72
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.250
Okay,

73
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.900
so I've got here a dashboard.

74
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.240
Ah,

75
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.050
is a simple dashboard that I've created on my excel dashboards scores and actually have

76
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.450
some worksheet activate code here that that is triggered whenever I activate the dashboard

77
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.410
worksheets on this workbook.

78
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.920
Ok,

79
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.290
so what this does is that it just hides the ribbon and all the excel features years so that

80
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.060
it would,

81
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.590
you know,

82
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.890
make the user feel like it's He's not in excel.

83
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.490
He's in a different applications.

84
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.150
We just hide the ribbon,

85
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.950
okay?

86
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.030
And we've got some code.

87
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.670
Actually,

88
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.650
that does that here.

89
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.410
So I can include that code for you.

90
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.990
This code will hide the ribbon.

91
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.840
Okay,

92
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.170
so this is a practical application for worksheet.

93
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.790
Activate event.

94
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.280
OK,

95
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.970
so that's it.

96
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.630
Basically,

97
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.230
the worship activate event is very simple.

98
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.250
He just include the code between the private sub and the end sub,

99
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.430
and it will be lunched whenever you activate a certain worksheet.
