00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Okay,

2
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.640
guys.

3
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.860
So now we're going to quickly demonstrate the simplest structure off a do loop.

4
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.400
So here I've got some code here with a do loop.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.210
So the first line of code will select cell a one,

6
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.820
and then you can see here I've written a do loop and inside it actor sold Offset one comma

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.950
zero dot select.

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.590
And this will just go one cell down.

9
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.640
This is what the code will do.

10
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.220
And as you will see,

11
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.990
the do loop in its current form will never cease to get executed.

12
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.320
So it will keep on executing the code over and over again.

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.900
And we will just keep on going one cell down infinitely,

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.510
and this loop will never stop.

15
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.470
So I'm gonna execute this code step by step.

16
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.220
Here's a first of all,

17
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.020
I'm going to select cell a one and then what I'm doing here is I'm going one cell down and

18
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.860
I'm just holding the F eight key to make the code get executed.

19
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.520
And if I actually press this continue button or this run button,

20
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.470
the code will never stop and my excel actually will crash.

21
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.650
So I will not do that.

22
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.270
But the do loop in this form will never stop executing the code.

23
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.980
So I'm just going to stop here.

24
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.350
And this is the simplest form of a do loop.

25
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.130
And this form is not used.

26
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.200
Usually it is usually used This do until or do while so we will see that on the upcoming

27
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.540
videos.

28
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.150
So thank you guys watching this video I'll see on the next one.
