00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.770
Hello welcome to the course on databases.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:09.140
In today's tutorial we're going to install postgresql and PGE admin for four windows.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.680
So let's go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.110
The first thing I'm going to need is a browser.

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.420
And in all browser we need to go to w w w dot post gray school dot org.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.930
Now this is the page where you can get postgresql and we need to go to the download tab at the top and

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.890
they will present us with a couple of options so you can select your operating system.

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.660
In our case we're installing postgresql for Windows.

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.220
If you're using a different system then you'll need to select a different option.

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.360
So go ahead and click on Windows and then we've got two options here we can use interactive installer

11
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.910
by enterprise to be all the graphical installer by big as well.

12
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.700
The one that we're going to use in this course is the installer by and tries to be so go ahead and click

13
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.620
that and this will bring up a new window again or a new page.

14
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.010
So here we're going to need to select the version that we want install so just install the latest version

15
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.330
that you have right now the latest version from his version $9.6 and once I'm going to go ahead and

16
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880
install that.

17
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.190
There might be a later version.

18
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
You should go for the latest version but not the one that's in there and better serve as a version in

19
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.670
beta mode which is still being developed then probably don't go for that one just go for the latest

20
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.080
fully released version.

21
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.990
And so it just system.

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.490
So here we've got.

23
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.620
I'm using Windows 64 bit and most likely you're also using Windows 64 bit.

24
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.350
The most recent machines are most the 64 bit.

25
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.460
In case you're using a 32 bit then you'll need to click here I had to check that you click properties

26
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.570
on your computer and then you just go here and check.

27
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.380
Here it says system type 64 bit operating system.

28
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.980
So you might say 32 but most likely 64.

29
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.960
So go ahead and select your version click that and that should start the download of postgresql for

30
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.680
you.

31
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.670
So your dollar should begin shortly.

32
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.270
If it doesn't click here but hopefully it will start just now.

33
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.310
So while it's downloading I wanted to mention what we are downloading so we're downloading and installation

34
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.960
package for both PGE admin and postgresql supposed Gaskill is the programming language the database

35
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.890
system that we're going to be using whereas PGE admin is a graphical user interface for that system

36
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.760
so you don't have to use a graphical user interface you can totally work with postgresql all through

37
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.740
the command line and that will be fine but it's much more convenient to use a graphical user interface

38
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.270
and that's why we're going to install it and it's a big advantage that we actually get them together

39
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.890
in one package so we don't have to run two installations separate it so there you go the file has downloaded

40
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.680
so all you need to do is you want to fill the story then go ahead but otherwise all you need to do is

41
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.620
just run this installer Solas get a second to come up so that it is IDB

42
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:27.870
and this is going to help us install the programming language and the dimiss database system and P-chan

43
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.390
and for so Holcomb's the postgresql set up wizard so click next.

44
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.210
So the installation directory.

45
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.530
I'm just going leave the default here data directory again.

46
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.920
I'm just going to leave the default here.

47
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.150
So passwords very important because this is how you access your database and is going to ask you for

48
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.850
the password when you log in for the first time.

49
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.640
So just whatever you type in here just remember it.

50
00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.820
Make sure to record it somewhere so that you have this password going forward.

51
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.950
I'm just going to type in a password here that I'm going to remember and I'm going to click next.

52
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.500
So if you're poor or don't sign up for whiskey just use the default option that is been suggested to.

53
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.550
That's probably the best way to go.

54
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:24.000
Just leave it at default then this can be also left to default so click next and set up is now ready.

55
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.150
So go ahead and click.

56
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.190
So this is going to take a bit of time.

57
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.110
And when it is done we'll continue this tutorial.

58
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.820
All right so the solution has been completed and here it's asking if we want to launch.

59
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.460
Stack builder at exit.

60
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.840
Actually we don't need stability that some additional features as you can add onto your postgresql we

61
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.570
are going to need that so just check that box and go ahead and click Finish and voila you've installed

62
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.220
postgresql and Pidgen 4.

63
00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:01.490
So if you go to your start bar and you select start and here then you type in PGE admin for admin.

64
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.300
There is no pop up so just take it and drag it onto your eyes and drag your onto a desktop and that

65
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.760
will bring up a shortcut.

66
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.990
If you didn't get one through this process and then once you launch it you can always just pin it into

67
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.320
your into your start bar.

68
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.010
That way it will always be there so let's go ahead and launch it because there's one more thing that

69
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.740
we need to make sure we do inside here.

70
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.590
All right so there we go.

71
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.830
PJ admin for has launched and now what we want to do is just go unclick service here you'll see postgresql

72
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:43.260
9.6 that's our server so if you click it it will normally ask you for the password.

73
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.230
Because this is the first time that we're using it just because I've already had admin foreign installed

74
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.660
it's probably remembered my password but it Lawsie for password and you can just input that password

75
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.290
that you selected during installation process and then the other thing that we need to do is to go to

76
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.560
a file and go to preferences which are going to set something up right away for the rest of the course

77
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.000
because it'll be required for down the track need to go and set up the binary parts.

78
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.670
So as you can see mine is really set up again because I did have posed as John P-chan Forestal previously

79
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.700
yours won't be set up at this stage but at the same time this is required for us to be able to complete

80
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.690
the course successfully.

81
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.630
So he's going to set it up now so we don't have to worry about later on.

82
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:35.070
So we're going to go to is find the directory where you installed postgresql and then go to pose rescue

83
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.090
Well in that directory.

84
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.380
Well that's the directory itself.

85
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.260
So this is where I installed pulse reskill.

86
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.860
Then there's a folder 9.6 and then there's a folder bin.

87
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.020
So basically that's a folder where all of these files are stored puji dump and so on and so.

88
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.010
So just go ahead and find that folder and copy the path to that folder here.

89
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.120
And go ahead and click OK.

90
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.470
And that way you're set for the rest of the course.

91
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:06.780
Now we have one more thing left to do to prepare everything so that we're all set to proceed with the

92
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.060
fallings toils.

93
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:13.800
So we let you go and set up the folder which we're going to use to upload data into pigeon before.

94
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.590
So just you can get rid of this window and I'm going to folder my desktop and I also recommend that

95
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:27.240
you place a folder on your desktop if you can call the databases so we need to change the permissions

96
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.080
for the folder so that page admin for can get data from here.

97
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.620
So right click your folder and go to properties.

98
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.590
And here you need to go into security and insecurity.

99
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.780
You need to change.

100
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.640
We'll be asking you to add this.

101
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.240
Everyone here so I'm going to show you how to do it.

102
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.160
I'm going to remove quick.

103
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.060
OK so this is probably how your folder looks like or something like that.

104
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:58.410
And here you just need to click edit and then each click add and here just type in e capital and then

105
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.400
everyone or everyone sort of capital E and click OK.

106
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:16.150
And just make sure that this new user that you've added has read exiguous read contents and write contents

107
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:25.550
so just make sure that all of that is checked all those checkboxes are marked to click OK and click

108
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.580
ok again.

109
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.370
So now if I check back here in security you'll see that I've got everyone.

110
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:40.320
And that will allow PGE admin for to go in and read files from there or write files if we need to.

111
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.310
But mostly we're going to be reading files.

112
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:48.860
So and that's where we will be uploading or storing all data sets and then upload upload them from there.

113
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.300
Now one thing I do need to mention is that this is basically you know you're changing the security setting

114
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.470
so now everyone can read this folder.

115
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.850
And this might be a security concern.

116
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:05.360
So if you're you know doing this these controls at work then definitely you know consult with your I.T.

117
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.770
department or administrators if this is OK to do.

118
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.920
And if you have the right permissions.

119
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.890
Also if you are uncomfortable leaving this like this folder open to everyone all the time then just

120
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:28.900
just do this right before you are applauding the dataset for a section into admin for so set the permissions

121
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:34.150
upload the data set and then just remove this everywhere user everyone.

122
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.840
While you're performing you know the tools in the section and until you get to the next section and

123
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:44.960
then again set the permissions upload the data and then unset the permissions so we're not going to

124
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.380
be doing that in the course which you can definitely do that if you're worried about your security.

125
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:57.650
And so there we go that's the final step that you need to perform in order to set up each admin form.

126
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.490
And I can't wait to see on the next tutorial until next I'm happy analyzing.
