00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,370
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases now that we've talked about lots of different types

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,650
of joins today we're going to take a step further and we're going to talk about joining in multiple

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,430
fields.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,950
So the two tables we're going to be working with this time are the procedures history table and the

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:23,370
procedures Details table so let's go ahead and look inside these two and see what we're going to be

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,840
joining soapstar from procedure's history and detail.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,400
So if we look in the history table you'll see that we've got information on which pets had which procedures.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,330
But this table doesn't provide the full picture right so we cannot tell the pets name the information

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,010
about the pets and we can't tell the information about the owner of the pet.

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,070
We only have the pet I.D. and that's fair enough because this is a good way of structuring databases.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,040
We've got the pet information in its own table with the owner's information in its own table.

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:06,090
We can join to the pets table through the foreign key here pet I.D. and we can also then join onto the

13
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,990
owners table through the owner ID field in there.

14
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,190
So that's totally fine.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,040
But then on the other hand on the right here we also don't have the full picture of the procedure.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,920
We have the procedure type in the sub code but we don't actually know the name of the procedure and

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,620
then other information about the procedure.

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,270
And why is that.

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,140
Well because that information is also stored in a different table in the procedures details table.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,120
So if you run this you'll see that here you've got the procedure type procedure sub code and you've

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,020
got the description.

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,600
So back in the history table for instance we had vaccinations right.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,390
So we had vaccinations number five but we don't know what kind of mix of nations these are because pets

24
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,180
can have lots of different types of vaccinations.

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,540
They can have rabies vaccinations they can have Lyme disease vaccination and all.

26
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,590
Lots of other types of vaccinations.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,730
Whereas if we now look in the procedures Details table and we look at vaccinations you'll see vaccination

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,370
number five is indeed rabies.

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,990
And here you even have you don't have just the description.

30
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,940
You also have the price.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:17,520
So our task for today is going to be to join the two tables so that we have the history of the of not

32
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,720
just vaccinations but of all the procedures and then on the right we have information additional information

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,680
about that procedure.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,000
So the description and the price we want to add that information into this resulting table.

35
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,780
Now my challenge for you is to actually pause this video an attempt to perform this on your own.

36
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,490
And why is that.

37
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,380
Well because we've already discussed joins in quite a lot of detail and hopefully by now you're quite

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,410
comfortable with the concept of Joines at the end at the same time.

39
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,980
We've already talked about joining on multiple fields in the theoretical tutorials for this section.

40
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,010
So if you combine the knowledge from those two you have quite a good chance of making an attempt at

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:07,270
performing this Join this is going to be quite a sophisticated joint but you have a good chance of performing

42
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,580
it on your own and then comparing to the video.

43
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,500
So give that a try and if you don't succeed then don't worry because you can always just continue playing

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,840
the video and compare what you got to what I will be demonstrating in this video.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,170
All right.

46
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,960
So if you'd like to attempt the challenge and post a video now.

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,560
Otherwise I'm going to proceed and demonstrate how I would solve this challenge.

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,800
So three to one here we go.

49
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,660
We're going to just keep this part of the procedures history and then we're going to say left and join.

50
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,850
So why is it a left join this artifact.

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,110
Well it's a live joint because we definitely want to keep all the information we have in this table

52
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,060
in the procedures history table we want to keep everything and we just want to add to it.

53
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,330
We want to add additional information to it on the right.

54
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,830
And so I love joe and it's very similar to a view look up in Excel if you used to them so whenever you

55
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,860
just want to add information to an existing table that's the Left Join the only kind of difference between

56
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,430
live joy and no major difference between a live joint and a real hookup is that if the table you are

57
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,480
looking into.

58
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:21,870
So we're going to be joining to the procedure Details table if for some reason one of these rules and

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,300
say this row gets matched to two of them.

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,910
Then what'll happen here is this roll will be duplicated and we've spoken about that several times that

61
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:38,410
duplication of rows occurs to match the number of matching rows in the second table.

62
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,130
So that's something you don't see in Excel you just get get a result but that would happen.

63
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,360
So basically whenever you're just adding information you should think of it as a left join.

64
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,500
So there we go we select from procedures history all have different procedures details and what field

65
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,720
we're going to be joining on.

66
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,950
So this is the tricky part.

67
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,610
This is the interesting part because this is basically what we are going to be discussing in this tutorial.

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,590
But let's give it a shot.

69
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,890
Let's say out of these fields we decide the procedure sub code looks like a unique identifier of the

70
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,720
procedure and therefore we're going to join on the procedure.

71
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,190
So let's go ahead and do that.

72
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:33,500
I would say as a as B I would say a dot procedure sub code woe to my knee.

73
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,270
Go equals the same thing.

74
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:45,590
And now before you're on this join what I wanted to bring to attention is that how many rows are we

75
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,870
going.

76
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,920
Or do we expect to have in the files.

77
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,550
And this is a good way of thinking about choice.

78
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,600
It's kind of like preparing for them and always being on top of your game.

79
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,750
So basically right now we have two thousand two hundred and eighty four rows you can see here on the

80
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,110
right at the bottom.

81
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,180
And that is in our just in this top table in the procedures history time.

82
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,140
Now that's basically what we're trying to do is we want to add information to this table we just want

83
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:20,390
to add additional the table so additional columns is table so the number of rows shouldn't change.

84
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,580
So let's go ahead and run this and join in let's see how many rows rows will get.

85
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,860
Once we're on the join you'll see that we have 8000 179 rows.

86
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,340
Right so the number of rows increased drastically.

87
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,770
And why does that.

88
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,500
Why does that happen.

89
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,760
Why did the number of rows increase so much.

90
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:50,090
Well the reason for that is that in our left table when we were joining.

91
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,630
Right.

92
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,320
Sometimes the value of the rows matched up several times.

93
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,580
Right.

94
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:04,860
So for instance this row pet ID 5 4 3 5 9 procedure date the 5th of February 2016 vaccinations procedure

95
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:11,660
sub code as you can see it's repeated many many times here so of all the way up to here so though these

96
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,570
rows got duplicated and this is something we talked about that rosea a duplicate when they match up

97
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,290
to several in the second table.

98
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,760
And here you can see it matched up to vaccinations.

99
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,340
Number five orthopedic number five general surgery is number five vaccinations number.

100
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,010
Oh actually sorry it did.

101
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,070
It only got repeated three times so there you go.

102
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,400
So this robot repeated three times and you got matched up to three rows here.

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,240
So vaccinations them are five orthopedic number five general surgery number five.

104
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,660
Right.

105
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,730
And then a similar thing happened here.

106
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,700
This robot matched to three different ones.

107
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,930
And why is that.

108
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,750
Well that is because we were matching on the procedure because you can see that the procedure code here

109
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,500
and here is the same here and here is the same here and here is the same.

110
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,100
And that is because in the second table on the right there were three rows of procedure sub code five

111
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,890
and so it did everything correct.

112
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:17,020
It's so that there's three matching rows so it made copies of this row two so that each of the matching

113
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:24,260
rows would have a would be connected to two linked to some row in the first table and that's exactly

114
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,590
how it was supposed to do it don't.

115
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:35,150
The issue here is that procedure some code is not a unique identifier of the type of procedure or of

116
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,500
the true of the procedure itself.

117
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:43,220
So basically there are procedures some code is a sub code for the procedure type.

118
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,650
So within vaccinations there are several.

119
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,090
So let's go have a look at the procedure Details table that will give us a better picture.

120
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,640
So if we go select

121
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:06,930
store from procedure details you'll see here that for instance vaccinations has six different sub codes

122
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:13,830
that hospitalization has one orthopedic has seven sub codes so sub codes they actually repeat again

123
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:19,250
and again as the big actually has nine general surgery has even more.

124
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:26,370
So there's lots of different there's some they repeat across different procedure types.

125
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:33,090
So therefore our unique identifier is not just procedure sub code on its own.

126
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:39,790
It's actually the combination of vaccination of a procedure type and procedure or subclass that.

127
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:49,650
So in this if we use these two together as them joining condition then you'll see that this out of these

128
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,360
three only the first row will be a correct join this wouldn't have happened this wouldn't have happened.

129
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,620
Same thing here.

130
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,480
And so on.

131
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,790
So this is a great example of when there's an aha there's a hierarchy so procedure type is you know

132
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:10,010
the first level higher than a sub code is the next level hierarchy in that the procedure identifier

133
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,330
and you need to use both of them when you join.

134
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,520
So that's exactly what we're going to do.

135
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:28,670
We're going to say on procedure sub code and a Daut procedure type you close the door at procedure type

136
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,120
Sinaloan for on this you'll see that resulting table has 2284 rows as we expected.

137
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:42,680
And everywhere there's only been one match so this this row got matched to this row.

138
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,080
And then this Droguet match to this row and so on.

139
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,840
So this is exactly what you wanted the result that we were looking for.

140
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,920
I don't think that I would change about this.

141
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,780
Join is now I would just actually put them all the way around and say Take this and put it above.

142
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:01,780
Why.

143
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,180
Well it's just an is the anaesthetic thing.

144
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,280
You don't have to do that.

145
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:12,850
But I like hierarchy's to be ordered correctly so procedure type is you know the first level so it comes

146
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:20,260
above then procedure Sopko but that's just just the way you like way to structure code you don't really

147
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,350
have to do that you can leave it the way it was.

148
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:30,070
And now when you run this of course same result and you can see that once again we can get all the information

149
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:36,850
here what the procedure so you can get the description you can get the price for every single procedure

150
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,320
that was performed.

151
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,230
So there we go that's how we join two tables on multiple fields the same rules apply for lift joins

152
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,810
in or joins right joins outer joins.

153
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,600
It's always the same you just simply just keep specifying the number additional conditions for joins

154
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,660
through these and statements.

155
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,990
So I hope we enjoyed this Tauriel and I'll see you next time.

156
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,490
Until then I'll be analyzing.
