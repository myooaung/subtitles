00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.430
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.680
So in other data sets are uploaded.

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.000
And today we're going to create our very first join.

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.800
So let's go and have a look at what we're going to be working with.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.240
So we're going to be looking at the two tables that we have which are pets and owners.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.000
So let's Right-Click pets and select the top thousand rows.

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.100
So here we've got a code that it was already generated for us which helps us select the top thousand

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.410
rows from the stage where we can even remove this part because we know it's not a big table so we can

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.150
just look at everything and there's only there's only 100 rows anyway.

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.090
So what we want to do now is we want to join this table to the owners table that we have here so let's

11
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.220
go ahead and bring this table in as well so I'll say also is Alexis star from.

12
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.390
And then you can just put this table in here.

13
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.440
And in fact we're going to replace these column names with also six star from for consistency.

14
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.950
Remove that and now if we are on this we don't actually need pads here because we've selected pets at

15
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.010
the top so we can just run that or just so everything is safe and we are definitely working with the

16
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.790
right database.

17
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.080
We're going to say use pets at the top and then it's a go that way we're going to always know that the

18
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.450
script has been executed on the correct database.

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.110
And even if we change this by accident and we run this script it gets changed by this line.

20
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.510
All right so here we've got select star from pets and so Nexstar from owners.

21
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.360
So how are we going to be joining.

22
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.000
What are we going to be using the left join for here.

23
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.840
Well here we've got pet the pets the information about the pets.

24
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.970
In this first table and in the second table we've got information about the owners what if we want to

25
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.040
find out which pet belongs to which owner.

26
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.300
Right.

27
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.560
How do we find out who is the owner of which pet.

28
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.180
And that's exactly what a LEFT JOIN will help us do here.

29
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.510
We've got information about the pet I.D. and the pet name the type of pet whether it's a dog cat or

30
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.680
a parrot gender age.

31
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.220
And then we've got the owner I.D. So this is our key to joining to this table because you can see here

32
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.100
we also have owner I.D. and I'm not just saying metaphorically it is actually called the key.

33
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.650
This is our foreign key in this table.

34
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.910
We've got a primary key which is this which is this column.

35
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.110
It's it's a unique identifier for every single row and then you go to a foreign key which is owner ID

36
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.500
was it a foreign key because this key is a primary key in this table.

37
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.170
And it serves as the link between the two tables.

38
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.630
So that's what we're going to rely on and we're going to create a live joint where we have the pats

39
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.450
on the left and on the right.

40
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.590
We're going to add this table on the right to owners table and the link between the two will be the

41
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.690
owner ID field.

42
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.630
So today we'll learn how to do that.

43
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.940
And just before we start interesting observation is that this table has 100 rows whereas this table

44
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.800
has 89 rows.

45
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.100
So why would why could that be the case.

46
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.450
Right.

47
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.170
Why is there.

48
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.710
Why are there more pets than owners.

49
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.850
Well one thing that pops mine is maybe they are pets that don't have owners.

50
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.620
But in reality that is impossible because somebody had to bring the pet to the veterinarian.

51
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.940
So when an owner brings their pets the owner's name is recorded and the pet name is recorded and information

52
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.700
is recorded for both so by default every single pet will have an owner.

53
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.730
So then how come they can be more pets and owners.

54
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.240
Well the other alternative is that there can be owners who have several pets.

55
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.360
So somebody might have a dog and a cat or might have two dogs and so on.

56
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.450
And that's what we're going to actually observe in this joint to do just good to be prepared for stuff

57
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.050
like that.

58
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.830
All right so let's go ahead and create this left join.

59
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.500
So you would say select star from there we're going to type in the first table every once in just say

60
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.010
pets.

61
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:22.540
You don't really need to type in TBO because that's that's that's where it's going to be looking anyway.

62
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:31.110
So once you select start from pets and then here we're going to say left join and now we're going to

63
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.260
say the new table owners.

64
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.570
And so this is a start but this is not enough.

65
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.540
This is not enough information because you're telling us you all that you want to take this table put

66
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.080
on the left take the cell put on the right but you're not telling it which column which columns to use

67
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.080
as links between the two tables.

68
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.740
So what you want to do is you want to say on and on to say that that's the key words that is used to

69
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.530
specify on which column to join which called us to join.

70
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:12.470
So here when say owner ID owner ID equals owner ID.

71
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.180
So that's what we want to do in theory but in practice this is not going to work.

72
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.400
If I run this you'll see that there's going to be an error.

73
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.980
And why is that.

74
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.950
Well because already if we run these two lines again you'll see that owner ID this field is present

75
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.860
is this has the same exact name in both of these tables so I ask you all it knows that it's working

76
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.400
with these two tables and doesn't know which column from which table to get take this column and from

77
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.470
which they will take this column.

78
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.850
For us it's obvious right for us it's obvious we we know intuitively what we want to do want to take

79
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.890
this one from here and one take this on from here.

80
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.900
But for a computer it's ambiguous.

81
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.030
So what we're going to do is we're going take pets and we're going to say PED's dot and then we say

82
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.270
owners and then it goes the owner's daughter and that will specify that this column comes from this

83
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.650
table.

84
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.920
This call is called from this table.

85
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.670
So if you run this now you'll see that we've got a beautiful left join created for us.

86
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.430
So if we scroll down you'll see that we have 100 rows because that's what 11. does.

87
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.880
It takes all of the rows of the table on the left and then to them it adds where possible columns on

88
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.680
the right.

89
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.030
And as you can see we don't have empty columns and in the second part or empty cells What was that.

90
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:43.300
Well that's actually tells us that indeed every single pair has an owner so there are no pets in this

91
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:53.270
resulting table where the owner part so this part where this part is empty so if somewhere this part

92
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.510
was empty that means a ped doesn't have an owner.

93
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:03.410
So basically that is a confirmation that all of the present owners and so therefore the second alternative

94
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:10.970
is true where some owners will have several pets and right away we can see here here's owner 1 5 3 0

95
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.400
8 9 McKenzie this person has.

96
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.750
So you can see is exactly the will just be by the owner and you can see that it's the same person this

97
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.030
person has at least three pets.

98
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:30.050
They have a bright the dog Angel the dog and Jake the cat.

99
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:37.790
And so if you look around you'll find more more examples of where an owner has several pets.

100
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.260
So there you go.

101
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:45.050
That's how a live joint works and that's how we have created it and hopefully the theoretical aspects

102
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:53.240
of live joins us now you can kind of see them in practice and how they're helping us combine information

103
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.420
from different tables.

104
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.310
And now we're just going to make it a bit more interesting.

105
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.750
We're going to say that.

106
00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.230
OK.

107
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.740
So we've got this joint but let's say we don't want to select all the columns that say we want to select

108
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.260
just some of the columns.

109
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:11.950
Well let's say we want to select the name of the pet and we want to select the name of the person so

110
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:18.560
let's do that let's say name common name now name as a keyword so we're going to put it in brackets

111
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:26.510
in square brackets to make sure it doesn't trigger any unwanted actions on behalf of this girl.

112
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.680
And that way we know it's just a column.

113
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.870
Now again if we just run this line or we just run this code which you will find is again we've got this

114
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.840
ambiguous error.

115
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.440
Why's that.

116
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:45.310
Because there is a name column there is actually two named columns in this resulting table.

117
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.620
You've got name which is the name of the pet and name which is name the dog and so therefore Ezekiel

118
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.610
does not know where to get this column from.

119
00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:03.870
So that's why we're going to do the same thing with said pets dog name and we say owners dog's name.

120
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.680
And now isko will know where to get these calls from.

121
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.470
Once you run it you'll see the name of the dog and name name of the pet.

122
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.790
So voila.

123
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:23.840
That is exactly how we deal with or work with JOINs and also that is how we specify columns when they

124
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.700
are ambiguous.

125
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:31.830
So it's actually a good idea to always put the prefix here so that you always know what's going on.

126
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:38.960
But sometimes it can be omitted if there is no ambiguity you don't have to really specify the prefix

127
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.700
which is the table name.

128
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.390
So there we go.

129
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:47.300
That's our introduction to Pracht the practical side of Joines and Conway to continue creating more

130
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.830
interesting joins in next Tauriel.

131
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.060
Until then happy analyzing.
