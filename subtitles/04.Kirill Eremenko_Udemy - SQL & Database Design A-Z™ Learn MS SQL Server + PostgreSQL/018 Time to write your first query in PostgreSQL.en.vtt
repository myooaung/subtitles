00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.610
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.870
OK so not now the theory behind this query.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.720
Let's put it into practice as you can see I'm working with Drey Eskew 9.6 through the P.G. admin for.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.200
And you can see we have two databases that will be working with today only one of them will be working

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.930
with the consumer complaints.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.060
So if we open up we need to make sure that it has some datings side of it.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.400
And as you can see we do indeed have some data.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.180
We have one table that consists of 18 different columns.

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.090
So the first example we're going to do is to try and display all of that data but that's hidden inside

10
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.960
of this database.

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.200
So in order to do that what we need to do is we need to select any element from this problem and you

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.880
right click it and just press Queretaro this will open up a new window that will let you directly work

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.710
with that database.

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.660
So the first thing is you know what we need to do is we need to write select and then since we want

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.980
to display all of the elements of this table we need to ride around all the column names and it will

16
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.470
take quite a while because there are 18 of them.

17
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.260
So I'm going to speed up for this moment so you don't get bored

18
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.290
ok.

19
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.300
So as you can see we have all 18 columns written down here.

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.940
It is a pretty big Querrey.

21
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.100
So now after we have this select statement written down what we need to identify is where we select

22
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.850
these columns from.

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.060
In our case it's the consumer complaints.

24
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.360
So let's just quickly put that down.

25
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
And now we just try to run this in order to run Asgill Querrey and PGE admin.

26
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.670
We need to present this lightning icon or alternatively you can just press F 5.

27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.090
So as you can see the equerries now being executed and because my machine is pretty slow it will take

28
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.180
quite some time in order to complete this.

29
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.470
So again I'll speed you up for the process so you don't get the word.

30
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.850
So as you can see our query just finished running.

31
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.620
It took me a whole one minute to run it and we have all the data displayed here in the data output section.

32
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.800
So as you can see there are 18 columns here indeed and there's about 6000 rows.

33
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.970
If I'm not mistaken.

34
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.950
So that was pretty impressive wasn't it.

35
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.210
We now have actually a view of the whole table and thus consists of a lot of useful information.

36
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.840
But it did take us quite a while to write all of these column names now.

37
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.690
And we had to write them exactly the same way.

38
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.580
The reason here.

39
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.070
Otherwise the admin will pick up a mistake a missing column and we will have to check every column name

40
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.390
to in order to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.

41
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.020
So this can be quite unpleasant.

42
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:05.440
In order to avoid this as you know we can select star and select star means the same as select.

43
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.000
So instead of writing 18 column names all I need to do is write select star from consumer complaints

44
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.190
and when I run it it will give me the same exact data out that it did before.

45
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:29.120
So as you can see it's the same exact data output we have again all 18 columns here and we have about

46
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.950
6000 rows displayed again.

47
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.360
As you can see that's much easier to type and you are almost guaranteed to make no mistakes.

48
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.500
So I hope that was easy enough for you.

49
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.780
Now before we go any further let's try and run another Querrey.

50
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.850
But this time we only need to display the product name and the issue with the product so we don't need

51
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.510
to display every other element of the table.

52
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.250
We only need to display the product name and the issue.

53
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.750
This product had so added to do that we need to go back to our columns and we need to understand which

54
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.460
columns we will be working with.

55
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.210
In our case we'll be working with Product Name column and the issue.

56
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.400
So all we need to do is run and you select query.

57
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.500
Again in order to do that just right click press query too and here we go and type and select.

58
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.260
After that we specify what exactly we select the first element will be product name.

59
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:39.240
Then the issue after that we specify where we like it from which is again consumer complaints and as

60
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.280
you can see let's quickly run it it will run much much quicker and it in theory has to display as only

61
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.960
two columns that the name issue and it still will be around the 6000 roll Mark as you can see that show

62
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.330
us exactly that.

63
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.980
Here we can just stretch this column so we can read everything about them.

64
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.000
So let's just go and quickly take a look around and we can see that there was a problem of credit card

65
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.870
that the costs consumer had the problem of billing statement or for example the credit card had another

66
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:21.060
issue with the interest rate credit card had an issue with delinquent account and so on we will learn

67
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.190
how to filter this search even further later on in the course.

68
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.410
But for now before we finished today's lecture Let's go and run one last question.

69
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.880
This one will be just a bit more difficult to make sure we've learned everything today.

70
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.280
So for Squirtle it's fiercly go ahead and create the query and you query.

71
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.620
And now for the last query you were asked to display names of all companies that received complaints

72
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.150
from consumers as well as zip codes and states of these companies.

73
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.380
So as you can see you need to display company name then you need to display the state and the zip code.

74
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.030
And in order to do this all you need to do is we need to write the query where we specify that we select

75
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.590
company name which is just a company because that's how the column is named.

76
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.530
Then we need to specify that we select the zip code as well as the state name.

77
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:24.980
And then we have to specify that we select it from consumer complaints table.

78
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:32.030
And as you can see if we run it it has to give us back three columns of 6000 rows that will be company

79
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.990
name zip code and state name where these companies are located.

80
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:43.900
If you change the order in which the columns name go after de-select that will not be a huge deal.

81
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.580
It only just displays in which order.

82
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.240
The result is displayed.

83
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.750
So it's mostly about personal preference.

84
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:58.330
Or maybe if you have a specific task from your client to display it in side order you have to do that.

85
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.370
In our case we just display them as it's easiest to write down.

86
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:09.380
And as you can see yes we have the company names that are different companies that all had any issues

87
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.620
with consumers.

88
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.360
And then we have the zip code of these companies and the state names in which these companies operate.

89
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.910
So yep that's pretty much it.

90
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.190
It's very important that you understand the logic behind the select query because it's the foundation

91
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.860
on which the whole sequel is build.

92
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.990
And I hope this lecture help you to understand that and to feel comfortable around as well.

93
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.520
I hope you had a great experience today and learned a lot and I'll see you in the next one.
