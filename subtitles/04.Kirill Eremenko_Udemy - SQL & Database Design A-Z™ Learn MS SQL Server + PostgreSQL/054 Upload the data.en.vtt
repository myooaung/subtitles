00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.540
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.460
So we've already downloaded the dataset and now we want to upload it into our database.

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.930
All right so here we got pajamas for opened up.

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.500
That's first of all create a new database right click select Create new database.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.580
And here we're just going to call it our pets because the data set is about pets.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.240
The challenge of about pets and I think it's just fair to call pets.

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.150
And now what we want to do is we want to upload our data set so we going need the code to upload it.

8
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.830
Therefore let's bring up a browser and go to superdad assigns dot com slash.

9
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:51.550
As you well know if you scroll down here to Whoops to Section 7 you'll see Section 7 as you will upload

10
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.820
code.

11
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.820
So just go ahead and click that button.

12
00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.880
Click the link and you'll get a word doc file download to a computer which looks like this.

13
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.550
And in here we've got quite a few lines of code.

14
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:15.190
So we want to copy all of them into Put PGE admin so contrl on Windows or comment on Mac to select everything

15
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.180
and copy it and then let's create a new query.

16
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.860
So right click and query tool.

17
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.190
I think we need a full screen here.

18
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.750
And there we go.

19
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.610
So there's a query.

20
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.780
It's all copied over.

21
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.830
And now we just need to create these tables.

22
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.710
So let's go ahead and just create all these tables.

23
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.780
First things first.

24
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.570
Right.

25
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.450
So this is done.

26
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.690
And next we want to specify the correct correct path.

27
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.540
So I'm on Windows I'm going to use the Windows version so I'm going to delete the Mac versions if your

28
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.260
Mac is a Mac version.

29
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.260
They're a bit different.

30
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.090
And don't forget to correct your path so make sure the user name is correct and just the full path of

31
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.650
your folders correct.

32
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.010
Mine is actually a bit different to what it says here.

33
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.790
Mine is this pass.

34
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:18.980
We go OK so with I just wanted to mention something with the last two lines this one for details and

35
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.700
procedure history.

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.840
Just make sure just for all of them actually make sure that the capitalization is exactly like an actual

37
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.440
file.

38
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.890
Because I think originally I uploaded it and there was a mistake it wasn't capitals so it might give

39
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.360
you an error if that's the case.

40
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.380
So just make sure it's the Capitals piece capital and these capitals so it's a it's case sensitive basically

41
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.620
so it has to match exactly the file name.

42
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.710
OK.

43
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.930
So we've created tables.

44
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.070
Now let's go ahead and copy the data.

45
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.760
There we go.

46
00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:02.530
That's 114 road 100 rows roses 89 rows there is 41 rows and there's 2284 rows.

47
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.520
Beautiful everything is copied.

48
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.180
And just to check.

49
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.590
You can do the select statements so are from pets.

50
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.280
Always a good idea and run that.

51
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.200
So here in this table you'll see that we've got a unique ID for every pet name and the type with it's

52
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.030
a dog cat or a parrot.

53
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.070
We've got the gender the age and we've got the owner I.D. It's wonderful.

54
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.260
Now let's check the owners

55
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.160
owner's

56
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.840
so similar table here we've got the owner ID which we also saw in the parody table.

57
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:53.410
So there was a foreign key here as a primary key but the name the surname street address the city the

58
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.150
state the state fall.

59
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.710
So Michigan Michigan and the zip code Okay wonderful.

60
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.440
So was another one procedure details.

61
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.690
All right.

62
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.490
So here we've got just information on any given procedure.

63
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.030
So this is a procedure type procedure.

64
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.860
Sub code in that type and then the scription.

65
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:28.040
So whether it was office school emergency bath Phyllida police spray and so on and then the price OK

66
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.210
so that looks like it's upload.

67
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.050
Well and finally we want to check procedure history.

68
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.590
So if you run that you'll see that here you've got again pet I.D. But now this is a global tail table

69
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.230
and we'll talk more about this inside the section.

70
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.090
Why did this one go global.

71
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:58.970
This was a nationwide table so for all pets nationally that are serviced by this chain of veterinarian

72
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:06.230
clinics rather than the other tables owners and pets are local to Michigan.

73
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.780
So there we go.

74
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:15.570
Here we've got procedure details of procedure date procedure type procedure sub code.

75
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.430
All right so there we go.

76
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.760
All four tables are uploaded and you're all set to proceed with the practical tutorials in this section

77
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.690
called wait to see the next tutorial.

78
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.630
And until then happy analyzing.
