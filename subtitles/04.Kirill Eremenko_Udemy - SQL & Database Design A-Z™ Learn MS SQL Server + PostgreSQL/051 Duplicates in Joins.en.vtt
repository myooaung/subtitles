Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.330
And in today's tutorial we will be looking at duplicates and joins and by that we mean what happens

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.090
when the column that we're joining on has duplicate values in one of the tables.

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.720
In today's example we'll be looking at two tables table A and Table B Table A lists orders that are

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.590
conducted for us and show up.

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.750
It specifies their region and their status so whether they were unpaid or whether they were paid.

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:36.110
Table B list the same orders but an itemized description of those orders so it lists the order number

8
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.110
the item that was sold within that order and the sales that were generated through the sale of that

9
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.880
item.

10
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.160
And as you can see orders in Table B can be duplicated because some orders consist of several items

11
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.490
for example Order Number One consists of a chair and a desk.

12
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.330
And so we're going to be looking at an example of an inner join between these two tables so basically

13
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:08.260
we want to take the order number from table A and use that to join table a table B also an order number.

14
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.150
So basically we want to connect the status of the order whether it was paid or unpaid to the item and

15
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.680
the sales of the order.

16
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.720
And currently the information is contained within two separate tables.

17
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.010
We want to bring it together.

18
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.240
From this image you can see that when we join the two tables on the order number there will be two matches

19
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.470
in the second table to order number one.

20
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.680
There will be one match in the second table to order number two.

21
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.960
There will be three matches to order number three in the second table and there is no matches for or

22
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.630
number four.

23
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.070
So because this is an inner join this row will be discarded from the final result.

24
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.620
And what will happen now is as you can see there's less rows in the table left then on the table in

25
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.890
the right.

26
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.550
So every time there is a multiple match the two rows that have been matched multiple times will be replicated

27
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.030
so duplicated triplicated and so on.

28
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.910
So in this particular case the final table will look like this.

29
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.330
And as you can see here some rows of the table on the left have been duplicated to match the number

30
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
of rows and the table in the right and is completely normal.

31
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.140
So this is the way the final table will look in our output.

32
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.890
So that's what happens when there are duplicate values in the column that we're joining on.

33
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.790
I hope you enjoyed today's Tauriel and I look forward to seeing you next time.
