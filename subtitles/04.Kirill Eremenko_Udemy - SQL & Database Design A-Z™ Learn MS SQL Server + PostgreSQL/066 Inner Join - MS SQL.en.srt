00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,470
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:09,670
So previously we talked about Joines tips and tricks and right Jones and day we're going to talk about

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,490
energises and we're going to work with a bit of a different combination of tables we're talking about

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:24,570
the Petz table and the procedure history table so let's go ahead and bring these tables up.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:34,800
So let's start from pets and so let's start from procedure.

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,400
Maybe it's make sure this works.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:47,760
Procedure history of procedures history in this case and this is just pets.

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,400
If we run these.

9
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:59,580
So here you can see the tables that we've selected and we're going to learn how to create in a joint

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,050
by combining these two tables and what do these table cells.

11
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,000
Well the first one tells us the pet's information about the pets or the identification number of the

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,960
name and so on of the 100 pets that are registered with this particular clinic whereas the procedure

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,530
details are procedures history table is a bit different.

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,150
It actually tells us again pet idea and then it tells us what procedure that pet has had and on what

15
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,450
date.

16
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,940
So we've got some pet had a certain procedure with procedure type and subgoal.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,670
But how is it actually fundamentally different to this table.

18
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,680
Well you'll see if you scroll down here you'll see that this table has thousands and thousands of Rosewell

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,480
not thousands thousands but several thousand of rows are present in this table.

20
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,300
And why is that.

21
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,100
Well not because these poor 100 pets have had so many procedures it's actually because of this table

22
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,140
procedures history table unlike the pets and the older stables.

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,990
This table is nation wide.

24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,830
It's shared across the whole country by the clinics of this chain of veterinarians.

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,700
Whereas pets and owners these two tables are local to that veterinarian that we're working with in Michigan.

26
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,390
So why would that be the case why would somebody structure their data in such a way.

27
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,840
Well the reason for that there could be many reasons for something like that in this case as an example

28
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,800
for instance where the owners and the pets tables they are local for privacy reasons because there is

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,420
no need for veterinarians from other parts of the country to see information on owners and pets which

30
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:53,490
are not from their clinic where as their procedures details are procedures history table it is nationwide

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,380
because what it is like what if something like this happens where a person takes their pets on a road

32
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,710
trip they go traveling they go to a different state and the pet gets sick and then they end up in the

33
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,780
veterinarians.

34
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:17,700
So the veterinarian needs to know what procedures that Pat had already had the procedures had been performed

35
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,990
on that pet previously so that they can perform their procedures accordingly so that they take into

36
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:32,040
account the previous medical history of that animal and therefore that's a reason why this table the

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,480
procedures history table could be available nationally so that if something good happens then veterinarians

38
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,150
from all across the country can look up certain pet idea and find out what the procedures history was

39
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,360
for that pet.

40
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,890
So there we go that's how the tables are structured.

41
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:56,810
And that's the core difference between them one is a small table because it's a local table to the Internet

42
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:03,150
and in Michigan and the other one is a national table across the whole country and that's why it is

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,880
greater.

44
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,410
And now we're going to figure out what type of join we need in order to combine these two tables.

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,090
So here we've got our two tables right.

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,430
So on the left or this blue table there's a big circle here is all of our pets the hundred pets that

47
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,400
we have in our clinic and then we have the procedure history which is a much bigger table.

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,430
So this is not to scale.

49
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,810
We've got several thousand procedures that happened right.

50
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,160
And what we've got here in yellow is an inner join.

51
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,960
So let's try to understand a great advocate that we need an inner join here so let's try to understand

52
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,620
why we need it.

53
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,480
INTERVIEWER Well what options do we have.

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,230
We've got an inner join left join right join and outer join.

55
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,370
Right so which we haven't discussed yet.

56
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,580
So why wouldn't we want a for instance right.

57
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:03,250
And why wouldn't we want to take the procedure history table and then just attach and then just match

58
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,960
it up with our pets table.

59
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,820
Well because then we would have all the procedures for all the pets that we're not interested in that

60
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,370
are not in our clinic that we're performing this analysis for right so we don't want that.

61
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:24,220
We want to get rid of any We want to not include in the select statement or in the output any pets that

62
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,940
are not now clear.

63
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,160
So it rejoins are good for us in this case.

64
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,480
We're all left to live join.

65
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,460
Sounds interesting.

66
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,750
So it would take all of our pets and it would cross-reference all of them to the procedure history.

67
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,180
So basically we would see which.

68
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,900
And this information here but then have would be left of all these pets that are in our clinic which

69
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,560
don't which have not had a procedure which have not had any surgery or any vaccination or anything like

70
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,710
that.

71
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,240
So that's what we're what we're after.

72
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,730
We want to know just out of out of the Pezzo we have we just want to look at the ones that did have

73
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,840
some sort of procedure.

74
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,150
So basically you want to do that kind of gives us answers that we want only the pets that we have.

75
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:15,310
So this blue circle overlaps with all of the procedures that all of the pets in the country have had

76
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,910
in these in this chain of clinics in this chain of veterinarians.

77
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,950
And therefore we want the crossover between the two which is an inner join so we only want our pets

78
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,760
and only the ones that did have a procedure.

79
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,490
And that's why we want an inner join.

80
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:32,940
OK.

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,140
All right so let's go ahead and perform this inner join.

82
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,910
So we're going to just keep this part select star from pets.

83
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:50,820
We're going to give it an alias as a let's put this in capitals as a inner join procedure.

84
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,410
Seizures history as B.

85
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:09,360
And then we're going to say on a dot pet ID equals b dot Pat

86
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:21,620
ID so if you run this now you will see that we've got a beautiful inner join which has 41 rows and on

87
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:28,340
the left with the pats on the right we've got the procedures that occurred and it is fair that this

88
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,240
table has less than 100 rows because not necessarily all of our pets had procedures.

89
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:42,060
And in fact actually maybe some peds had procedure several times so for instance we see this pets with

90
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,830
864 73 had several procedures.

91
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,910
So this doesn't mean that there's 41 pets that had procedures.

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,580
This means that there's 41 procedures performed on the pets that are registered with our clinic maybe

93
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,760
several there were pets that had more than one procedure.

94
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
As we can see that is the case indeed.

95
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,920
Now let's try to understand how is this inner join different to a left join or right join.

96
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,330
So let's start with a Left-Right.

97
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,770
If we have a clip we free had put a live join here.

98
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,970
Then we will see Silex star from pets as a left join to the procedures history.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,990
So basically we'll take everything from the pets table without excluding any rows and then we would

100
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:31,810
add the procedures history where we can where it's available on the right so if we're on this you'll

101
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:38,240
see that we've got a lot of nals right so we can see that we've got we've actually got more than 100.

102
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,990
We've got seven rows in our original Petz table we have 100 rows and that's because as we just discussed

103
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,710
there a duplication of growth has occurred because sometimes in the procedures history table pet ID

104
00:08:51,710 --> 00:09:00,240
comes up twice and then obviously this same pets row on the left has to be duplicated.

105
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:10,810
So just as we saw before there is Biskit and somewhere else we had this again that's a different there's

106
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,950
several biscuits in this is that people seem to like the name.

107
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,410
So you can see this row right.

108
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:25,090
And this Phroso is even though it's the same pet here and here you can see that the procedure was different

109
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,360
it was on different dates.

110
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,840
So here is grooming and here's a vaccination right.

111
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,410
So different procedures.

112
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:40,860
And because of that because that there's two rows for this pet in this dataset on the right the rose

113
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,170
the left go duplicate and that's why we ended up with more than 100 rows.

114
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,630
And also you can see all these animals.

115
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,930
That's because these pets never had any procedures performed and therefore there was no match.

116
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,160
There was no matches in the procedures history table.

117
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:01,410
Now if we do it the other way if we do it RIGHT JOIN what will happen is this becomes a primary table

118
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:08,310
and now we will have all of the procedures history ever performed on any pets in this whole table.

119
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,640
And then on the left we're just going to add information from our pets table where it is available so

120
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,640
if we run that you'll see all of these new.

121
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,600
And if we scroll down occasionally you will see that information has indeed been added was that will

122
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:34,040
because these rows with the Knolles they're obviously pets from other clinics from the country where.

123
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,990
So basically that's why information on them on this the information on the pets was not available because

124
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:46,650
it's simply not present in our table whereas this pet is indeed from our region and therefore the information

125
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,470
was available and then again got all these no.

126
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,690
So if you scroll down you'll see these nano rolls occur occasionally because they are matched up to

127
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,940
procedures where it's possible.

128
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,490
So there we go.

129
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,570
That's what would have happened if we did a right join as you can see in all in our Of all these three

130
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,610
cases left right and in the correct one that we need is indeed an inner join.

131
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,710
And that's why we're going to replace his back with an inner join.

132
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,870
So all in all you can see that even though an inner join returns less rows it's actually a bit more

133
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,770
complex.

134
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,630
It's a bit more sophisticated because it trims down both the tables trims down the walls from either

135
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,930
of the table or wherever there were no matches it will trim down the nose.

136
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:43,660
And also once again we witnessed in action the situation where the rows get duplicated when there's

137
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:51,190
a CERN like parody comes up several times in one of the tables the another one it gets duplicated the

138
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,690
rows get duplicated to be able.

139
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,360
So you can match up properly to all of the records.

140
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,140
So there we go that's our result for inner joins.

141
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,240
I hope you enjoy today's Statoil have a play around with that see what other tables are the ones we

142
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,030
have you can try and enter or left or right join on and see the differences.

143
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:20,890
Always a good idea to get some of that practical experience and just just play around with the code

144
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,240
and see what you can get.

145
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,980
