Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.870
And today we'll be taking a quick look at working with marchers.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.480
If you remember we already went through working with wild cards that are used to narrow down your search

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.100
results with March or chart and to yours any day up.

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.790
And today we'll be taking a closer look at the string functions so string functions are actually functions

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:32.160
that let you work directly with strings and manipulate them in different ways.

7
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.840
They ask you all has a bit less because of the engine limitations.

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.280
So go ahead.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.200
We're working again with console games table.

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.980
So let's open a new query and first let's just quickly select all from console games.

11
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.810
Now Walder running what do we expect to see we expect to see again 12 columns of fillable data.

12
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.650
Now the first function I'm going to showing you today is called Lenn and what it does is you can see

13
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:16.360
here we can say that we want to like game name and then we want us like Len of this game name of this

14
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.860
column and we can run this.

15
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.660
So what it would turn to us it will return to was the game they call them untouched.

16
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.220
And then it actually shows the number of characters that these names consist of.

17
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.230
So for example the base Wilkins's of 8 characters and Sonic the Hedgehog consists of 18 and so on.

18
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.450
So the interesting thing about this is that you can actually implement those functions inside and select

19
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.180
statement so you don't have to write it anywhere from or to like say when you can actually write it

20
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.940
inside the selected statement.

21
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.680
Now let me quickly show you another function which is called left.

22
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:12.660
So let's say that we want to select left off publisher and then specify for what this does it return

23
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.760
to stores only the first four letters from publisher column.

24
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.990
So if we quickly include here the publisher just then touched version of it you will see the difference

25
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.520
and the similarities.

26
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.660
So basically some publisher names like THQ or Sega are represented correctly because they consist of

27
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:44.140
four or less characters but Nintendo and Activision and touchstone are all limited by that rule that

28
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.000
we set here.

29
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.790
We can also use the right function and that will return us DARPA's And so it will hurt us for characters

30
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.840
starting from the last character.

31
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.910
So again THQ and Sega remain untouched while Activision Nintendo touchstone began very hard to understand

32
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.770
what's the meaning behind them.

33
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.160
But again as you can see the function is inside the select so that is quite interesting.

34
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.900
And now the last function to show you today is called reverse and that's a pretty interesting pretty

35
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.600
entertaining function sometimes.

36
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:30.270
And so what you want to say is you want to put rivers and then in the brackets you want to include genre.

37
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.080
So again this time we just you can include any column here in the color in the brackets but we just

38
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.570
want to see genere.

39
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.890
So you understand how it's different.

40
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.600
So reverse all the does.

41
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.590
It basically reverses the order of the characters remaining the case sensitivity.

42
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:58.050
So these are the four main functions I would say the most commonly used functions string functions as

43
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:07.460
Q all more string functions can always be found in your greyscale documentation or anywhere on line.

44
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.830
Today's lecture wasn't that informative.

45
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.740
Just to let you know this street function exist how the work and the syntax behind them.

46
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.700
So now that if you ever encounter a task where you need to manipulate data inside the string you can

47
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.320
do it.

48
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.310
So I hope you enjoyed today's lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
