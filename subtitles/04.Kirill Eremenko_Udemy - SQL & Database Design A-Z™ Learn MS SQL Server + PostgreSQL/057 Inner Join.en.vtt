00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.980
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.340
And today we're going to look at a very important type of join which is called the inner join.

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.640
Now we were talking about the theory of an inner join.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.720
Let's have a look at it in practice.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.260
So let's create a new part of our code we'll call this inner join.

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.270
And here we're going to work with a bit of a different combination of tables.

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.010
We're going to work with the Petz table and we're going to work with the procedure history table so

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.680
Petz table as we know.

9
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:39.040
So I'll just copy this from here Silex are from pets gives us the names and identifications of the pets

10
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.030
that are attributed to this veterinary clinic.

11
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:54.310
Now the procedure Details table or procedure history table is a table that is a global table for this

12
00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.250
organization and it is across all states of the U.S..

13
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.960
So what does that mean.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.080
Let's have a look.

15
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.850
That means is that this table is huge.

16
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.920
There's 2284 rows and so these are all the procedures done in 2016 for all of the pets that visited

17
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
any of the clinics of this organization in 2016.

18
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.410
So it's very important to understand the difference here.

19
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:31.010
The pets table the pets table the owners table these variables are local to the veterinary clinic where

20
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:40.920
we're conducting for which we're conducting this analysis so that specific one building in Michigan

21
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.360
somewhere in that one state that one building that's very local so therefore they're quite small table

22
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.510
so 100 pets and less than 100 owners 89 owners whereas procedure history is shared this table or this

23
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.550
or this table is shared across all of the clinics of this organization across the whole country.

24
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.160
And they could be they could have their own reasons to do that.

25
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.220
And for instance they keeping the pets and owners tables local due to privacy reasons so that there's

26
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.200
no point there's no need for veterinarians in other states to know the names of the owners and the details

27
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.380
of the pets that are not are not in their clinic.

28
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.440
But at the same time the procedure history table might be shared across the whole organization nationally

29
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:39.020
because it is important for any missionary to look up any pet I.D. and find out what kind of procedures

30
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.610
had been carried out.

31
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.460
Why could that be will because people go traveling with their pets.

32
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.340
Right.

33
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.730
And for instance if somebody from our clinic or even from our states went and took their pets on a road

34
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.250
trip somewhere to that other part of the US and then the pet needed to see the visionary and like got

35
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.150
sick or something.

36
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.150
Then the veterinarian needed would need to know the previous history of their patient or the pet and

37
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.820
they would need to be able to access it and therefore this is this could be a reason why the procedure

38
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.170
history table is shared globally.

39
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.550
So what does that mean for us.

40
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.640
Well that means that in this table there's lots of pet ideas that are not in our table.

41
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.320
So in our table we have 100 or we only have 100 pets and they have their IDs but in here we will have

42
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.860
way more other pets from other states that have had procedures.

43
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:45.010
And so the question now is how do we find the pets that our pets that have had procedures how do we

44
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.290
find out what procedures they are.

45
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.420
So what kind of joint Do we need for that.

46
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.620
So now that's what we're going to investigate.

47
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.040
So let's have a look at a small presentation or a slide that I have prepared here and that will help

48
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.810
us understand why we're going to what kind of joint We're going to be using.

49
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.460
So here we've got our two tables right.

50
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:12.350
So on the left or this blue table there's a big circle here is all of our pets 100 pets that we have

51
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.750
in our clinic and then we have the procedure history which is a much bigger table.

52
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.780
So this is not to scale.

53
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.000
We've got several thousand procedures that happened right.

54
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.540
And what we've got here in yellow is an inner join.

55
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.340
So let's try to understand a great advocate that we need an inner join here so let's try to understand

56
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.270
why we need it.

57
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.850
INTERVIEWER Well what options do we have.

58
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.610
We've got an inner join left join right join and outer join.

59
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.760
Right so which we haven't discussed yet.

60
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.760
So why wouldn't we want a for instance right Joe and why wouldn't we want to take the procedure history

61
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.330
table and then just attach and then just match it up with our pets table.

62
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.200
Well because then we would have all the procedures for all the pets that we're not interested in that

63
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.630
are not in our clinic that we're performing this analysis for.

64
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.740
Right so we don't want that.

65
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.810
We want to get rid of any We want to not include in the select statement or in the output.

66
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.310
Any pets that are not an alcoholic.

67
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.700
So a red Jones not good for us in this case.

68
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.860
What left to live join.

69
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.840
Sounds interesting.

70
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.130
So it would take all of our pets and it would cross-reference all of them to the procedure history.

71
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.860
So basically we would see which it would and this information here.

72
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.870
But then we would be left with all these pets that are in our clinic which don't which have not had

73
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.090
a procedure which have not had any surgery or any vaccination or anything like that.

74
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.640
So that's what we're what we're after.

75
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.050
We want to know just out of out of the Pezzo we have we just want to look at the ones that did have

76
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.300
some sort of procedure.

77
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.500
So basically you want to do that kind of gives us answers that we want only the pets that we have.

78
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.690
So this blue circle overlaps with all of the procedures that all of the pets in the country have had

79
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:13.520
in these in this chain of clinics in this chain of veterinarians and therefore we want the crossover

80
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.140
between the two which is an inner join so we only want our pets and only the ones that did have a procedure.

81
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.730
And that's why we want an inner join in our case.

82
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:30.090
So let's go ahead and perform this inner joint to get the result that we want.

83
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.410
So now we can just get rid of this and we can continue from here select from pets and we will say we

84
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:47.100
really know that we will need an alias as a we can say inner join and I say procedure history

85
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.920
as B and we will say on a dot Petz ID.

86
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:03.180
And so this pet idea here and we have in the procedure history table so we just check this quickly.

87
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:12.660
So Ixtapa from procedure history.

88
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.630
So let's just quickly check that we have the same call them here.

89
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.120
Got pet ID here as well.

90
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:28.060
And so we're just going to say be Daut pet Id call so if you're on this now you'll see that we've got

91
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.660
a pet I.D. and we've got our pets from the stables.

92
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:43.690
And then we've got the second table here starts from Petar is well so repete ID procedure date procedure.

93
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.720
Type and procedure subclassed.

94
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.020
Right.

95
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.860
So there we go.

96
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.040
We've joined the tables and let's rerun this and see how many you've got.

97
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.790
We've got 41 rows selected in total so.

98
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:03.300
And if you scroll down through these rows you'll see that some of our pets actually have had several

99
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.570
procedures so blown apart.

100
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.250
The dog has had at least two vaccinations and then we have one.

101
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.020
What else do we have here.

102
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:21.140
And you just also need to look at the parody Id rather than just the name because sometimes pets have

103
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.590
the same names.

104
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:27.620
So you'll see that several of our pets have had more than one procedure.

105
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.890
And but in total as you can see we've got in this table we've got the result that we wanted.

106
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:41.240
We've got all only pets that belong to this veterinarian clinic this specific clinic because we worked

107
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.460
with the pet stable and at the same time all of the pets in here have indeed had a procedure so we don't

108
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.800
we haven't picked up any pets that haven't had any procedures and that's what an inner joined us basically

109
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.200
as we remember from theorie tutorials.

110
00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:01.500
It basically matches up in euros from table from this table to this say from two rows from this table.

111
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:06.280
And then it just discards and you rolls that didn't match up from either of the tables.

112
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.230
And that's the difference between an inner join and a left join a live join wouldn't discard rows from

113
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.700
the table it would have all of the joints.

114
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.540
If I change this to a left join you know let's have a look at changes to live join.

115
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.720
You will see that.

116
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.340
Now we've got the ones that match top and we've got all of these that didn't match up.

117
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.200
So all of these pets actually didn't have any procedures and that's not what we want.

118
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.190
In this case in this case we want just the ones that match up so also we can have a look at the region.

119
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:42.500
So if you on a right join here you will see that you've got all of these.

120
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.980
On the other hand you've got all of these procedures that relate to pets not from our clinic.

121
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.540
And that's why this last part is empty and that's not what we want.

122
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.680
We want just the ones where this matched up to this and that's it.

123
00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:01.640
So this is going to be an inner join and the other thing I wanted to show you here is going back to

124
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:08.930
that some of the peds have had several procedures so you can see that for instance Bonaparte dog whose

125
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:18.390
IDs J-Date 24 29 he's had two procedures right at least two procedures and these two procedures here.

126
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.640
One was on the 2016 of Filho fourth and one was sweet 16 or fifth or eighth right.

127
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.380
So four days apart fourth of May an eighth of May both vaccinations subgoal five.

128
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.900
But these are two separate different procedures.

129
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:40.620
So this part this row is different to this row in this table but in this table what happened is this

130
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.980
row got duplicated.

131
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.310
Right so it intentionally Escurial has duplicated the to match it up twice to this table and that's

132
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.150
worth something.

133
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.350
Another thing that you talked about in the theory tutorials about Joines and now you can actually see

134
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.580
it in practice.

135
00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:04.470
So have a look see if you can find another example of that where a row is duplicated because one of

136
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:11.340
the paths had several procedures and just just check for yourself that indeed that's how it's skewl

137
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.270
is treating this situation.

138
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:19.230
So there we go there was a first in unjoin as you can see it's a bit more complex than a left join or

139
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.170
right join.

140
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:27.570
Even though it usually returns less data it is a bit it is a bit more interesting on say a bit more

141
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.170
challenging to understand.

142
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:35.160
But hopefully now you're quite comfortable fit and have a play around with that try to perform some

143
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.040
of your own inner joins and see what results you can get.

144
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.880
And Alcyone to Tauriel.

145
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.740
Until next time happy analyzing.
