Hello my name is Kiril and my name is Xillia.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.330
And we're very excited to welcome you to the databases and ask you of course for data.

3
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.520
We all know that data is growing.

4
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.040
In fact it's growing exponentially.

5
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.560
Wherever you look around you see data and you've probably heard that as well is that database programming

6
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.270
language.

7
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.870
So it's imperative to know that.

8
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.920
Q Well in order to succeed as a data scientist and the natural question here is why this course there's

9
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.720
so many clauses out there and ask you out why would you choose this one.

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.850
Well because we do not only teach you how to practice as well where we teach you how to think like a

11
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.820
data scientist and that is for two reasons.

12
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.930
First of all all of the examples in this course are real world data sets and real world chances.

13
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.620
And also inside this Clauss will teach you about database design and all understand things like schemas

14
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.880
and normalization of databases which is so important for data scientists.

15
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.940
And in this course we teach you not one but two as well software.

16
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.970
In this course you will learn how to use photographs.

17
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.480
Q Well as well as Microsoft's server as well.

18
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.730
So does that sound too good to be true.

19
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.390
Well let's have a look at Santa Claus so you can decide for yourself if it's right for you.

20
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.470
And this course will learn how to install both Microsoft a SQL Server and postgresql onto our computers.

21
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.740
Then we will proceed onto creating our first databases and uploading data sets which is a very important

22
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.600
skill to have especially if you want to perform ad hoc analytics in SU Well then we'll proceed onto

23
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.120
Syria and they'll be a bit of theory in every single section of the course so we understand better what

24
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.600
we're doing then we will move on to creating Eskdale queries and you will get some hands on experience

25
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.670
Bufo real world data sets while learning the basics as well.

26
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.970
Everything about Joines scheme is normalization and even involves a skill and along the way it will

27
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.250
be right there to guide you to make sure you're on top of your game.

28
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.170
There's a all well if you really want to start your career in data science then take this course now

29
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.310
join us inside.
