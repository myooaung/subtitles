Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.230
And in this section we're talking about Joines.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.080
This is a very important topic especially in relational databases because that is the essence of relational

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.040
databases.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.420
We have all these different tables or relations and you need to get your data out of them.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.140
So how do you do that.

7
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.490
Well you have to join the different tables together to find the full picture.

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.270
And that's exactly what we're going to be talking about.

9
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.660
We'll have a couple of theoretical tutorials to get you up to speed up the joints and then we'll dive

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.520
into the practice and we've got a very exciting challenge ahead of us.

11
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.070
We're talking about a veterinarian clinic and helping them make sense of their data to see inside.

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.400
And let's jump into the first lecture.
