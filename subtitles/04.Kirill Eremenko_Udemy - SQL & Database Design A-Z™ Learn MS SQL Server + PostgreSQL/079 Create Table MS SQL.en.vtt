00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.480
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.180
Today we'll be learning to create our very own first table not database but table as you can see how

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.410
Microsoft your Server Management Studio loaded up inside of it.

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.050
I have my database created and ready to go and let's just go ahead and create a new table because as

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.590
you can see we have no tables here just yet.

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.770
So let's go ahead create a new query and type in the following create table and then your table name.

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.130
In my case it's going to be movies because this table will be all about my favorite ladies.

8
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.820
So after that you open brackets and in the brackets you go ahead and list every single column you want

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.230
to create.

10
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.950
So the first column for me logically will be moving in the data type for it.

11
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.420
It's very important to when you type after every single column name and then to put restrictions on

12
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.200
the data type.

13
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.350
So I will say that normally we can be more than 200 characters and put a comma.

14
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.790
Now let's move on to the second column.

15
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.760
That was easy right.

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.840
So let's do it again.

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.520
This time I will say movie year you can create any table you want to just follow the example.

18
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.810
In our case I want to put it integer because I just want to create a movie that will have four numbers.

19
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.660
Basically the year to me is released not the date data type just the integer.

20
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.730
So next on.

21
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.200
Let's go ahead and create the country of origin.

22
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.880
I will just call it country because I want to avoid making any mistakes for that.

23
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:35.620
Or rather I want to enable myself to be able to connect this table with any other table through the

24
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.560
column country because countries will never change the country names are the same for any table and

25
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.810
it just good to have a column that you can link to other tables.

26
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.130
So I will say that no country is bigger than 100 letters and move on.

27
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.380
So my last column name will be called hyun and Jenner will be where.

28
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.190
So here is an issue.

29
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.990
Theoretically genere can consist of two of infinity different Genner submariners and that will make

30
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.390
up in that amount of characters.

31
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.290
However if we just leave it empty.

32
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.470
Unlike poetry it will not give it infinite amount it will set the maximum length to one.

33
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.200
So not to this let's put it to a thousand will sacrifice a bit of efficiency just to have that safety

34
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.570
that no matter how many genres the movie has.

35
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.270
It will never fail to satisfy our rules.

36
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.430
So now we can already run this query and create a perfectly normal table.

37
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.040
The only thing I want to change is I want to put a bit more advanced stuff.

38
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.810
So I want to say primary key I want to specify what's the primary key for discussion.

39
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.750
Primary Key is used to uniquely identify this table by a certain amount of columns which will become

40
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.510
primary key.

41
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.900
And in our case we need to specify it to be movie name but not just movie name we need it to be movie

42
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.470
name and movie.

43
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.530
And this is due to the fact that if you think about it a lot of movies shared the same movie named because

44
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.320
it's a reboot.

45
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.100
A sequel that doesn't have any number in it or just the remake but the same movie or under a million

46
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.470
name that has a unique year when it was produced is unique.

47
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.230
It will never be the same for any two movies.

48
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.720
The movie name and movie.

49
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.940
So this guarantees that no matter what the name of the movie or the year it was produced together it

50
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.060
will be able to uniquely to fight this table all the time or elements of this table.

51
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.910
All right.

52
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.570
So this is the settings behind it.

53
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.360
We just write in primary key open brackets inside of it.

54
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.090
We write one or any combination of columns that will make them the primary key and we can create this

55
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.070
table and it will really be very good.

56
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.290
The only thing I want to put is an article of faith and judger.

57
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.890
I always want to feel honor no matter what.

58
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:59.800
So in case I ever want to see any comedies or dramas or challenges I will always be able to find every

59
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.840
single movie on the list.

60
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.380
So all they have to put in here is not not that every time I try to put a new movie in way of no underspecified

61
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.310
it will give me a mistake saying that please specify your gender.

62
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.760
So now if we go at this you can see that command completed successfully and then periphrasis the table

63
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.260
many will will see our new table here.

64
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.030
So lets go check out the columns.

65
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.850
Inside here we see already something different.

66
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.280
The primary key was assigned and automatically changed to Eichen and the properties of these two columns.

67
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.960
So we have women named primary key which are two hundred.

68
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.230
Now move your primary key integer.

69
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.000
Not now.

70
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:45.830
Country worker a hundred now and the we're not Sudani column that can be avoided can be white is not

71
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.190
all.

72
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.060
Everything else has to have some value and it some information and then in the case we see the unique

73
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.710
primary key for this table.

74
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.730
And we're complete.

75
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.130
We already created our table.

76
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.110
Congratulations.

77
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.660
It was very easy and very logical.

78
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.790
There's really nothing to be afraid of.

79
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.650
And with time you'll just get more and more used to it.

80
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.520
The only thing I want to go through is the fact that we have a very interesting way of creating tables

81
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.010
in make yourself their skill set management studio.

82
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.410
Just make creaking on the table menu and selecting this right click on the table and so like in table

83
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.990
we can go on and write anything I want.

84
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.250
So again one of the columns I would have written here.

85
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.830
Moving them into data type type and started typing and watch her go to 50.

86
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.950
Change it to 100.

87
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.260
Specify it or it's now or not.

88
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.310
And then the interesting part is I could have went to the column properties and select the more advanced

89
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:49.120
properties here but this is not needed for this simple table and you might want to use it on your own

90
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.480
time.

91
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.230
You might not.

92
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.680
It depends Solanum.

93
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.700
So let's go ahead.

94
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.720
Closes windows don't save it and just be happy with it we already create it.

95
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.460
I hope you enjoyed this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
