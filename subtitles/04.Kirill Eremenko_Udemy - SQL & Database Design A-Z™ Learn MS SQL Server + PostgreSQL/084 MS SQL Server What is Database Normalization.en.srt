00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,850
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:10,410
Today I've got a very exciting section prepared for you we're talking about database design and specifically

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,080
we're going to be delving into the realm of normalization.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,160
I've got some very exciting slides prepared ahead and I can't wait to get started.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,940
You excited?

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,670
Let's jump straight into it.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,410
All right.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,450
So what is normalization Why is that important.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,740
Well the definition of normalization according to Wikipedia is the process of organizing the columns or

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,300
the attributes and tables or the relations of a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,980
data integrity.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:48,240
All right so that's quite a broad definition and it promises a lot but what does it actually mean and

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,190
what does it actually do.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,710
Well throughout the section we're going to aim to understand how we can better structure our databases

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,690
to remove the potential for any update insertion and deletion anomalies and also just speed up the process

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,760
of the way that these databases are utilized.

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,130
So let's have a look in a quick trivial example which will show us or guide us in the right direction.

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,940
So here we've got a table and this is a table on items that are sold at a clothing store and we've got

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,910
shorts jeans and long pants that are being sold.

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,750
We've got them in different colors and prices and taxes.

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,520
So can you see anything wrong with this table.

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,800
Well first of all right away we can see that this table in the colors column has duplicate colors right

23
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,920
so has instead of just one value sometimes.

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,130
Or in this case and all the rows has two values instead of one so yellow green blue black yellow green

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,940
and blue brown So that is a potential for error right.

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:01,260
So we want just one value in our columns in a database rather than sometimes having two values sometimes

27
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,840
having one sometimes having three.

28
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,670
So right away we can see that that doesn't feel right that something could go wrong there.

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,560
So what else can we see that could potentially be wrong here.

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,500
Well if we look closely we'll see that these two rows are identical.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,780
Right.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,940
And in a database we don't want to have identical rows because the second row in this case doesn't add

33
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,110
any value.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,230
So those are some obvious things and in the section we'll definitely learn how to understand the theory

35
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:35,190
and this design behind how we want to get rid of these obvious issues of the table.

36
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,010
But actually there are some other things about this table that are not so obvious but could also be improved.

37
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,450
Let's say that we are operating under the condition that color does not impact the price in any way.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,160
So this in this store color of the item of clothing does not change the price for those yellow green

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,330
black or whatever other color doesn't matter.

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
And let's say we want to add a new role to this table.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,920
Right.

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,670
So let's say we want to add a new row and we want to add jeans which are purple Now when we want to have this new

43
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,090
row What we'll have to do is we'll have to fill in all four columns we will have to fill in item and

44
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,770
type jeans the color which is purple then we'll have to fill in the price right and we'll have to fill

45
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,730
in the tax.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,700
But the thing is because color doesn't impact price and therefore doesn't impact tax.

47
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,340
We already know what the price and the tax should be because we have a column row.

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,760
With jeans already in it.

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,400
So we've got a row the second row has genes and therefore we know that the price is 35 and the taxes $3 50.

50
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,520
And therefore when we filling this information manually or updating this information as we're adding

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,400
this rows this fifth row our table.

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,770
There are two things happening.

53
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,990
First of all we are duplicating information so we're performing work that isn't necessary.

54
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,770
This information is already present in our database.

55
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,840
There's no point there's no purpose in us actually writing that information and it's it's extra work

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,390
that we're performing which takes time which takes resources and generally slows the process up.

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,740
And the second thing that happens is that there's a potential for error.

58
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,550
Right we already know that price is thirty-five dollars and the tax is 3 50 for jeans.

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,260
But in this case when writing this row in What if we specify the incorrect price or the incorrect

60
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,830
tax rate.

61
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,970
Why create this additional potential for error.

62
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:33,570
And so that's another kind of those things that is not that obvious in the database and that's something

63
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:39,540
we'll be looking at throughout the section how to understand these things and how to structure and design

64
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,210
your databases in a way that will prevent these things from happening.

65
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:51,450
And so the obvious question here is why Kirill, Why do we need to learn about database design.

66
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:58,770
We're data scientists this is the realm of database administrators and data engineers and a data architects

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
and the custodians of the data.

68
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,100
Well the reason for that is pretty simple.

69
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,430
So there's actually a couple of reasons.

70
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,680
First of all, here I'll give you four reasons.

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,800
First of all by learning about database design and going through this section of the course you definitely

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,750
don't have to go through the section of course you can totally just skip it and you probably will have

73
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,740
a good career in data science.

74
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:30,060
But knowing these things will really boost your career and will help you be a much more proficient data

75
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,260
scientists and why is that.

76
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:38,400
Well first of all you will understand why other databases that you are working with have been designed

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,300
in a certain way.

78
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,520
You'll have a better understanding of not just how they work but exactly why that happened and what's

79
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,830
the thinking that went into that.

80
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,920
Second thing is that you will understand how to navigate your way around those database.

81
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:59,310
So even just by being introduced to a new database right away been you know some very brief exploratory

82
00:05:59,580 --> 00:05:59,930
work.

83
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,180
You'll be able to tell what kind of structure this database has and therefore you'll be able to navigate

84
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,190
it better because you'll know all of these templates and we're going to cover.

85
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:16,050
And next this is point number three you will be able to understand potential vulnerability and flaws

86
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,900
in the databases that you're working with.

87
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,190
Right.

88
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,860
And so you'll know what to look for you'll be able to make recommendations on how to fix those things

89
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,840
and that's an additional skill something not many people would be able to do.

90
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,400
So people that don't know these things won't be able to understand and make those recommendations.

91
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,980
And finally point number 4,  you'll be able to communicate effectively with the data custodians be

92
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:45,870
those database administrators database architects database engineers and basically anybody who's behind

93
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,350
the database design and who's working with the database on a daily basis.

94
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,340
So an effective communication will help you get results faster.

95
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,170
So there you go those are quite some substantial reasons why to indeed go through this section and learn

96
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,820
these things.

97
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:09,040
And plus it's actually very fun so I'm quite excited about sharing this knowledge with you so if you are

98
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,630
on board I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial

99
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,620
And until next time, happy analyzing.
