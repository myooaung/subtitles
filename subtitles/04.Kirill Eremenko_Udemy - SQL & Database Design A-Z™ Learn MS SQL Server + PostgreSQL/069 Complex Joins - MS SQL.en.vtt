00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.120
So we've covered quite a lot of topics off already.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.380
We've talked about talking about left joints.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.050
We've talked about right joins in the adjoins FULL OUTER joints and we've even talked about joining

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.630
in multiple fields and plus all of that is backed up with the theory tutorials which you had at the

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.520
start of the section so you should be getting quite comfortable with the topic of Joines already and

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.440
that's why today we're going to move on to a more complex topic.

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.500
We're going to actually talk about complex joints.

9
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.940
All right.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.610
So what is a complex join and how the deal of competition.

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.470
Well we've already noted that our information is kind of dispersed across the different tables we get

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.140
owners information PED's Information Procedures information and the actual history of procedures.

13
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.800
And we've seen that we can connect the Petz table to the procedures history table with an inner join

14
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.470
and we've also seen in a separate trial that we can connect the procedures history table to the procedure

15
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.700
Details table through a LEFT JOIN on multiple fields.

16
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.770
And so now our challenge is to combine all that into one huge joint.

17
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.380
And why would you want to ever do that.

18
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.840
Well let's say for instance you want to find out information about the pets like detailed information

19
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.950
about the pets and the actual costs of procedures performed on those pests on those pets.

20
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.240
So basically you need to connect this table to this table but you can't just do it directly.

21
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.380
You need to go through the procedures history table to connect to that table so or basically or what

22
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.170
you actually need is you want to get this table to the history table but history table doesn't have.

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.900
It doesn't have information on the costs that you will get from the details.

24
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.710
So inevitably you're going to have to connect all three.

25
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.590
That's what we're going to do.

26
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.700
So let's get started.

27
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.430
We're going to say select star from pets as a.

28
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:12.000
And then we get say inner join procedure as history as B.

29
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.110
And we want to join on a Daut pets.

30
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:30.100
Heidi equals be dot pet ID and you need to be careful because sometimes these fields don't have the

31
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.450
same name sometimes in different tables.

32
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.760
The field here might be called Petz idea and here might be called Pet identifier or something like that.

33
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:46.150
So you really need to know your database or data sets or you need to just check every time just to make

34
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.190
sure you are typing in the correct column name.

35
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.950
So there we go.

36
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.830
So if we run this you'll see that we are able to join our two tables and the resulting table has 41

37
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.090
rows which means doesn't necessarily mean that 41 pets had procedures performed as we discussed previously

38
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.380
some procedure some pets had several procedures performed like for example there's dog here Bonaparte.

39
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:20.200
He actually had three procedures performed on him so therefore there's less than 41 pets in here.

40
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:29.310
But what they're what we can say is that 41 procedures have been performed on pets from our table pets.

41
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.060
OK so that's our first part.

42
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:39.490
Now we want to add information about the details of these procedures so we want to know the description

43
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.740
of what it what type of vaccination is this or what type of surgery is it.

44
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.970
And also the cost.

45
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.800
So we want to add that information and therefore this is going to turn into a complex join.

46
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.000
So how do we perform complex joins.

47
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.390
How do we add another join onto this existing joint.

48
00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.270
Well what you need to think the way you think about it to make things very very simple is just think

49
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.240
of all of this as just one table let's say because in reality it is the result is one table here.

50
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.290
So if you take all of this and you just imagine that it is just a letter X for example so select r from

51
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.520
X gives us this result.

52
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.630
Now we want to add additional information on the right.

53
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.010
So how would we go about that.

54
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:31.960
Who would say left to join and then would join to our procedures procedures details table.

55
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.920
And then I would say on what you want to join and so on.

56
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.560
So basically you would you would just continue typing like that.

57
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.650
And that's exactly what you should do so let's just cancel all of that.

58
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.030
So just treat this as a individual table and just in your mind and that way it'll be very simple to

59
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.620
operate with complex joins.

60
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.050
And here to just say left join because we are adding information on the right.

61
00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:05.440
We just went out lives join as we start typing procedures details we can call it as I see by the way

62
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.510
these don't have to be called ABC you can call it anything you can call it Zed's you can call it why

63
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.720
you can call at my table three Anything but this is just convenient and it's easy to understand what's

64
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.140
going on so you just increase the numbers the letters as you cycle through the alphabet as you add more

65
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.030
into join.

66
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.570
And then here as we remember from this part we just want to say on.

67
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.780
So we want to do a complete Zoes on Two-Bits.

68
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.340
So we want to join on the procedure type which comes from this table procedures history.

69
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:49.720
So we're going to say be Daut procedure type equals C Daut procedure type because there's a procedure

70
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.370
type in the details table and we want to say be it's procedure sub code so this column

71
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:12.340
procedure sub code it calls see Daut procedure are actually just copying from here procedure sub code.

72
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.880
So once you've done that you've got your first join.

73
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.530
This is an inner join.

74
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.930
And it goes all up to here and then you've got an additional join left join over here.

75
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.860
So if you run all of this together you'll see that we've got three tables combined and congratulations

76
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.960
this is your first complex join.

77
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.520
So here you've got the paired ID table or the table pairs table going up to here.

78
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.340
Then you've got the paired ID table going up to here or this is the procedure procedures history table

79
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.270
going up to here.

80
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:52.650
And then here you've got the procedures up procedures history table goes up to here and then the procedures

81
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.230
details table goes up to here.

82
00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.660
So this is going to highlight this one so it's easier for us to see the three separate or one two and

83
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.420
three.

84
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.970
And so let's just recap on how all this came to life.

85
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.900
We have this table and we wanted to get it for our pets.

86
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.910
We wanted to find out which ones of them had procedures done.

87
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:21.990
And we wanted to find out the prices of those procedures so as we discussed previously in this section

88
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.680
we needed to do an inner join with procedures history table so that we would remove the pads that never

89
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.280
had procedures and would also remove procedures done on pets not from our data assets from other states

90
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.570
in the US and therefore we ended up with this table.

91
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.010
And don't forget that there's duplicate rows here for like as we saw Bonaparte's three times and that's

92
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:51.230
because some pests had several procedures done or at several different points in time.

93
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.770
And so that's our two table joined.

94
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.500
And then on top of that we wanted to add information about the prices.

95
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.680
So there we go.

96
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.040
That's exactly what we did over here.

97
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.950
So there you go that's how you perform a complex join.

98
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:14.630
I know it might seem scary at first but with time as you get to practice some more and more.

99
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:22.170
As long as you think of it in that sense as a join after it's performed like this is a joint.

100
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:27.240
Just think of it as a separate table and then you just keep adding on it.

101
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.510
It actually becomes very straightforward.

102
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.270
What what exactly we're doing here and how it's all working.

103
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.660
So I hope this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

104
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.330
Until then happy analyzing.
