00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,720
Hello welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,980
And today we're going to learn a useful technique that is not that advanced but at the same time can

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,030
come in handy and can help you structure your code.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,420
So we're going to learn about cleaning up your.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,380
So let's have a look at this complex join that we created previously and you'll see that it is quite

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,400
growing quite quickly.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,560
And these are not that these tables are not at large.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,490
They're quite small.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,980
They've only got a few columns in the first table if you call them and the second if he comes in third

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:40,040
but because of the number of tables the whole result is growing very quickly and imagine if the tables

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,110
originally were bigger you would by now have a couple of dozen columns.

12
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,780
So the challenge here is to leave only the information that you actually need.

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,180
And that's what we're going to talk about briefly to day.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,730
So cleaning up your joints.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,020
All right.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,770
So basically we're just going to find out how to select the best What's the best way to select information

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,430
when you to copy this.

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,010
And here we're going to go through this and find out what and what we can throw away right away.

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,420
Well let's have a look at the poems that we're joining.

20
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,620
All right so here we got pet I.D. equals pet I.D. and so pet I.D. equals parody and that is something

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:31,600
you should know that whenever just play by definition whenever you join on a column that means that

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,390
in every single role the value of this column is going to be equal to the value of this column.

23
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:46,640
That's because simply you're specifying this condition here so if there will be no other role where

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,150
these these values don't equal because if that were the case it wouldn't be in your resulting joins

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,730
simply because the way you specify this conditions so always in a resulting join unless you specifically

26
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:04,770
for some reason need both columns to be in place you can always get rid of at least one of them.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,930
One of the two columns that you're on now in case you were on one two three columns right.

28
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,700
So that's three pairs of columns that we have here so there's one pair the pet ID.

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:26,750
Then you've got the procedure type that's another pair and then the procedure sub subclass sub code.

30
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:26,990
Right.

31
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,740
So that's three pairs of columns that we have.

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,470
And out of each pair we can get rid of one of the column.

33
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,740
So that's what we're going to start off by doing.

34
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,030
So we're going to get rid of those.

35
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,380
And that to do that we're going to need to type up these columns here.

36
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:52,700
So let's go ahead and do so we'll say pet ID comma was the comma comma then we'll say something like

37
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,140
name because we want the name of the pets then we'll say kind.

38
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,880
We want to know what kind of pet it is.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,820
Gender age.

40
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,550
So for now we'll just type in all of them except for the ones that we've agreed to exclude already.

41
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:17,210
So now we won't type in pet ID again because we are in the habit and we'll see procedure date is that

42
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:32,310
the correct name for this column will look to your date then we'll say procedure type procedure

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:43,790
sub code and then we won't do procedure type and sub code again because we you have them will say description

44
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,440
and price.

45
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:55,190
So hopefully I got all those right and if I run this now you'll see that already we're saving some space.

46
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,000
OK so Pileggi OK see I fell into the trap of not specifying where they come from so let's go ahead and

47
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,680
go through them and specify.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,700
So these are a this is a this is still a owner and you still this came from B.

49
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,220
It's very easy when you just use the alphabet.

50
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:24,300
Use them alphabetically or name them alphabetically because in YOUR know in which order they came see

51
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,850
and prices see their Ingrosso.

52
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,790
Now if you run this you can see that the table is smaller now.

53
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,880
Now the next thing that we want to do is maybe there are some columns that we actually don't need and

54
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,010
the final result so maybe if you're off to the you want to know the pet idea you might not need to know

55
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,560
the name of the pet and the kind and the gender and age.

56
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,900
So all of that information if you just after the price that the owner has to pay for that page you might

57
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,920
just want to parody the owner ID and you know the procedure dates yes.

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,460
Or you need all this information right so that basically means you could take out some going to comment

59
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:12,460
them out you could take out the name the kind the gender age.

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,720
Right.

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:22,330
So if you run this now you have a much smaller table and then you can really super-G care owner and

62
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,430
information about the procedure and the price that they need to pay.

63
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:26,760
Right.

64
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,750
In some cases you might not even need all that information you might just need if you want to issue

65
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,730
an invoice or a bill to the owners.

66
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,500
You might not need information about the pet.

67
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,230
So this is where it gets interesting.

68
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,050
Don't need any information even information about the owner.

69
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,210
You don't need about the procedure or day procedure type description.

70
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,760
None of that.

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,700
You just need the price.

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,560
And this is why it's so interesting is because if you look at it we have information here display from

73
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:02,260
the from Table A where the owner got owner I.D. which came from this pet table and we've got the price

74
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,640
which came from Table C.

75
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:11,890
But there is no way that we could have gotten this information just by having table A and so just by

76
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:20,560
having a table pet Id just by having or just having the pets table and the procedure detail say well

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
there's no way to join them.

78
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,880
We had to have this intermediary table which is a procedure history in order to get the result but at

79
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,820
the same time we're not displaying any information from the procedure history table so it's quite interesting

80
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,660
I find that you've got like this ghost table in the middle in between.

81
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,660
So you did need it for the join.

82
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:44,590
You needed it to join Petz to proceed your history to join the procedure details to get the costs for

83
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:51,930
all those procedures but we're actually not displaying any information from this table and that is you

84
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,400
know just an interesting situation and it still works totally fine it doesn't matter which displace

85
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,730
these things to separate what you display is kind of separate to how you structure your join so just

86
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,470
reiterate that concept.

87
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:13,680
So there we go that's how you clean up your joint you can always remove some columns that were parts

88
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,170
of the join criteria and then just pick out the columns that you actually want to get the result that

89
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,820
you are after.

90
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,720
So I hope you enjoy this Tauriel and 14 Exham.

91
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,400
Until then happy analyzing.
