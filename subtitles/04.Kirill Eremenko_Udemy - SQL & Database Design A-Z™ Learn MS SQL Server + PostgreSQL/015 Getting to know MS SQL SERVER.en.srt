00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,860
Hello and welcome back I just want to give you a quick tour around the microdot SPL surmounted and so

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,270
on.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,840
So you don't feel afraid or maybe nervous working with it.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,450
So we're not going to be writing any queries today we're just going to see what is inside of this software

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,670
and what they is.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,370
So on the left you can see object explorer what it's used for it's used to navigate for all your different

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,240
databases and your different tables.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,210
You can do everything using queries but it's just much easier doing it right here.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,830
Inside here you can see that if you right click on any of the elements you have a lot of different options

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,510
of what to do.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,320
So select all poznań Rowsell editor €200 scream table has and so forth will become very valuable to

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,470
you.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,900
The more you work with this software.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,160
Right now there are not very important because we will be teaching you to do roofing using queries or

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,180
at least most of the stuff but this is just a quick way to do a task that usually requires you writing

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,230
a large query to do another thing important here is that just keep it nice and organize security sort

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,310
of objects that replication and management don't worry about that.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,270
Right now it's more advanced stuff that will come to tackle later on.

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,290
Also here you can see that there is you can disconnect the subjects are connected.

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,570
You can refresh it very useful and you can also show to some policies.

21
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,480
Now if we click here and just say and you query this main window pops up this is where you write all

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,140
the queries.

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,010
So if you see different text is highlighted in different colors.

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,990
So that is very important to know that it's not important now is just a very convenient method for you

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,610
to understand what you're working with.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,150
It's a building function.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,370
It's just regular function it's an operator.

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,950
It's for example a database name Microsoft Eskdale server management.

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,270
It is very useful because it can just drag and drop on your table or your database or your even columns

30
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,030
names inside.

31
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,860
So as you remember it just uploaded all of this table in here.

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,950
So if you can just drag and drop it here it just makes you so much easier it just makes everything much

33
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,400
easier.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,930
You don't need to spend time writing and a lot of your head.

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,920
So going up to the Start Menu you have your main button which is called execute Phyfe.

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,430
Then you have the D-bag which is always a very useful tool to have and you have them worry for all the

37
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,270
scores will mostly be working with new query in aggregate.

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,810
If you hover on top on any of these functions or any of any of the functions in the query or any of

39
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,250
these commands here you will see useful tips or explanations and shortcuts.

40
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,730
So in the query if you're going to close it.

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,990
Let's say we're going to write anything and try to call it now.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,150
It will ask us if we want to save it or not.

43
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,460
Usually I don't save them unless they're very hard and important work to do.

44
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,010
But in case you want to save it we'll just open up this menu in which you just give your file name and

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,780
choose where to save it.

46
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,610
This is some text formatting stuff right here just to make your Corti look a bit better.

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,470
Going back a step forward step controls that control why are very important tools than you have.

48
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,100
Copy paste select all of that.

49
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,680
Now as far as what you need to know about skills her management studio this is pretty much everything

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,060
we're going to be showing you how to work with it more and more and you'll get more comfortable and

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,200
discover a lot of useful tools and tips inside of this menus.

52
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,500
Also if you want to you can go to though you can adjust your window to be different.

53
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:45,170
Have several queries and the same display and depending on just your workstation and your work preferences.

54
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,490
So I hope now you feel a bit more familiar with this software.

55
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,640
I know this sounds a bit scary that there's so many things you need to learn and remember.

56
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,940
But truly there's nothing you need to learn and remember other than the.

57
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,410
So if you know all the functions if you know all the commands you will do ok you will do everything

58
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,380
just it will take a bit more time and with time you will learn all of these short cuts that are here

59
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,850
for your advantage for your pleasure.

60
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,520
I hope you enjoyed this lecture.

61
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,400
I hope you're very ready to go ahead and actually start practicing the knowledge that we're going to

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,960
give you.

63
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,250
And I'll see you in the next one.
