00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,270
Hello and welcome to altar tables lecture in this lecture we'll be taking a closer look at the altar

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:07,940
function.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,700
So before we start let's go to my databases.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,900
This public select your table run a new query.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,790
So in here just select all from and then specify movies.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,820
Just make sure we have everything right.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,110
Again as you can see we have four lines of code here.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,300
Sorry for lines of data for rows of data here everything field of information.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,800
But if you remember already in this section we tried to feeling the Godfather with our country USA because

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,130
we forgot to put it when we initially input the data in and it was really frustrating because just to

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,250
change this one so we had to write a whole big query in order to do this and imagine to have more and

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,100
more cells missing data.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,070
This just piles up to the point where it's quicker and safer to just delete the table completely and

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:07,870
create it another time like create a new fresh table from the very beginning in order to avoid those

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,200
nontheist in this table.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,370
What I want to do is I want to set that country by default has to be fieldin of USA.

17
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,320
So if I didn't specify what I wanted the country to be filled in with I just put in USA and it's filled

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,340
automatically.

19
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:27,820
So in order to do this we need to use the default function and we need to use the alter function so

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,710
alter function.

21
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,730
What it does it says that alter.

22
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,800
Then you say table.

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:39,790
So it basically letting know as well that you're going to be working with a database table or column.

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:47,500
In our case first we need to say that we're altering a table that is named movies and then we want to

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,290
specify that in this table will either throwing a column that is named country.

26
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:59,430
So now we say that we want to set the country to be equal by default.

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,600
To USA.

28
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,160
And this is achieved by writing this small line of code.

29
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,770
So first we state to ask you all that we're working with the table movies then we say that we are working

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,500
with the column countries and then we say that we want to update all of the countries we want to set

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,340
the whole country column to be by default USA.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,420
So now for us it should give us on the stakes as you can see it altered quite returned successfully.

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,110
And if we abdicated here if we refresh it we will see nothing changing really the constraints remain

34
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,660
the same and of course doing the same.

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,500
But if we go here to dependencies window we can see that we have our primary key.

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,130
If I remember movies primary key that's defined by movie name in the movie.

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,920
But no one else has a function that basically sets a value to me.

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,710
USA.

39
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,700
In country if we were filling in.

40
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,420
And if there is no data specified for the country.

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,370
So now go ahead and quickly test this Solas go ahead.

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:06,610
Open our query back up and in Harolds Go ahead say insert into movies and then specify values.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:18,520
In the here would say Test 1 default and then we input and test.

44
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:26,160
So and go ahead run this as you can see we specified that this is default because this is not the last

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,510
column and we need to put something in the just good to do this just to practice especially in the beginning.

46
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:40,420
And now if we say select all from movies we should have five rows of data this time.

47
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,730
And as you can see the country is filled by default with your site.

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,700
So it worked.

49
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:54,570
Now every time we have a new row at it the country will be default unless we change it to something

50
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,330
honored and Yosei.

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,790
Now lets go ahead and practice some more with ultra as you can see.

52
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,430
Right now we have four columns and let's say you want to add a whole new column.

53
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,430
In my case I want to add a column called the rectors.

54
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,060
So I remember which movies I like but which directors and of the new movie comes up and I see the familiar

55
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,200
director name.

56
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,410
I can check it out.

57
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,970
So what we want to do we want to again state that we want to alter table movies and then because we

58
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:30,240
are not altering any of the existing columns and were not getting any of them what we're saying is that

59
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,790
we want to add it.

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,010
So we're adding a column called The rector that will be obeyed type called word char.

61
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,860
And let's say number of characters will be no more than 150.

62
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,230
I don't want to specify that not now or default because it's impossible to specify a default value and

63
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,580
then just go ahead and run it quickly.

64
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,930
Right.

65
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,190
Select statement from that from movies.

66
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,860
And if we're on this we can see that we have.

67
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,860
And you call them is currently filled with empty data.

68
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,570
So what we want to do is we can only say we want to update table movies so we're not going to be changing

69
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,240
any structure of it.

70
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,220
We're just going to be changing the date inside and we want to said that we're going to set director

71
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,700
to be equal to Christopher Nolan.

72
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,550
So the go ahead right here.

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:42,980
Christopher Nolan where and heroes go movie name equals inter-stellar.

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,610
Now as you can see because I made a mistake here and they didn't follow my own naming stations.

75
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,940
If I run it right now it will make me.

76
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:56,050
It will give me a return because I have no inter-stellar inside.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:08,850
So what I need to do is I want to input were lower and then put these in the name inside brackets and

78
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,950
they say inter-stellar all lower letters and run it down.

79
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:21,130
So because we're updating and not altering we can remove this table and intransitively.

80
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,220
So we say that we want to update table movies.

81
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,840
And because we're not altering anything in those by default that it's movies because there's only one

82
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,790
table called movies inside a database.

83
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,790
My database didn't want to said that.

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Now all of the data in the record column this is done by set in the record call and it has to be equal

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,880
to Christopher Nolan.

86
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:45,680
But if we just run it like this every single movie will have direct or equal to Christopher Nolan.

87
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,710
And that is not correct.

88
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,640
So after that we want to have a work function in which we specify that we're lover when we name equals

89
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,760
inter-stellar and we have to put it in lower because we did not follow.

90
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,030
I did not follow the naming convention.

91
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:06,690
And if I did not put lower I will have a mistake because there is no such movie as interstellar rhythm

92
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,950
and small characters.

93
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,090
It's all in capital letters in our table.

94
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,950
So let's go ahead select all from movies quickly run it just to make sure to subdue that.

95
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,980
And as you can see there it is in the very end.

96
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,710
Now we can have movie name inter-stellar director Christopher Nolan.

97
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,680
If we want to we can go ahead and update every single utterer movie but that will just be a lot of time

98
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,890
consumed is the same syntax and it's very important that you just in this day be behind it.

99
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:44,010
That if we're altering the table we need to say that first we're altering and then we need to specify

100
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:53,730
that we're altering a table then the table name then we can put in which column specifically we're updating

101
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,630
we're altering in order to just write and call them names to some generic column and then we want to

102
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,030
say what we're going to do with this column.

103
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,010
We can set the value to soundfield we can to default not now and so on.

104
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,460
And then when it comes to adding something up we can again we have to specify that we're updating a

105
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:29,790
table and table name and then we can have inside of here did we add alter alter or delete any specific

106
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,670
column.

107
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,540
So with is basis of because here they're are all different functions.

108
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,380
And this is the general idea of this index behind it.

109
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,820
So I hope you understand the logic behind all these functions and realized how easy it actually is to

110
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,450
create a table and how hard it is to alter them just because the amount of code you had to write and

111
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,060
make sure that you make no mistakes in this new code.

112
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,810
So as well really works good with structure data.

113
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:04,850
But on one condition that when you initially input into that table where you do the initial calculation

114
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,850
it or any other type of function manipulation it has to be correct otherwise you will have a very hard

115
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,760
time fixing it.

116
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,250
But that's why you back up.

117
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,100
That's why you can back up and save all of your databases.

118
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,830
So at any time it can roll back to the version that you had previously.

119
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,110
I hope you enjoy this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
