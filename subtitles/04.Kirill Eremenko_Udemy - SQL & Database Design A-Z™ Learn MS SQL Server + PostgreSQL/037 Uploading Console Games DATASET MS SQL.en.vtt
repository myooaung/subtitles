00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.550
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.330
Today we'll be uploading our second data set for the scores.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.970
And as you can see I went to super size dot com slash.

4
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.840
Ask you all.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.210
And I went to Section 5 working with data and in here we want to download my skill upload code console

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.080
game cells and cancel dates.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.100
So I already downloaded them and uploaded them to my desktop.

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.860
So please go ahead.

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.620
Close this window open for Microsoft as eschew all Server Management Studio.

10
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.880
Create a new database.

11
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.400
So here's the first thing you can call it whatever you want I'll call it console games.

12
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.730
Just so it's not confusing to me.

13
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.850
So after that click ok wait for it to execute now.

14
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.230
Right click on console games select tasks and from the dropdown menu select import data.

15
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.740
The process is pretty much identical to what we've done for Section 4 but the only difference is that

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.850
this time we need to upload two tables at once so make sure to choose flat file source in the file name

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.930
browse for CSFB and in here.

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.540
Let's first upload console games but.

19
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.460
Open English.

20
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.510
Latin limited nature the text qualifier is set.

21
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.540
Let's check the columns.

22
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.900
Everything looks normal here.

23
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.450
Let's go to advanced select all of them and make sure they're set to 5000 word preview.

24
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.470
Everything looks good.

25
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.650
Everything looks normal.

26
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.990
Select next.

27
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.990
Make sure you select Microsoft all the D-B provider for ask your server sir name.

28
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.430
Everything looks to be all right.

29
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.680
Go ahead click next and make sure to change it to your console games to win the game that you have and

30
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.620
to work with this data just yet.

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.360
Click next run immediately wait for it to execute updates on executing.

32
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.650
Just press close.

33
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.430
No you will see a table inside of here.

34
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.280
That's called Raw console games.

35
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.990
Now go ahead and work with the second table first.

36
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.950
Again tasks.

37
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.260
Import data.

38
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.040
The new window will be opened up.

39
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.930
Click next you on how to maximize that.

40
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.150
Select again flat file source file name browse Go ahead look for a CV.

41
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.690
In this case we're going to be working with console dates.

42
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.740
Make sure that TX qualifies sat playing and next come up next.

43
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.230
Everything looks nice.

44
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.520
The only thing in advance.

45
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.640
Make sure to change eröffnung again to five thousand.

46
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.000
So again you don't have to click anything just see preview go ahead.

47
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.870
Next select Microsoft only to be go at like next.

48
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.510
Make sure to change it to raw.

49
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.730
And now we can run it because this one contains a very few rows.

50
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.320
Only about 50 I should run quickly pressed close.

51
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.350
Refresh this.

52
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.530
Now you'll have two neighbors in sight.

53
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.970
So this is the point where you want to open up the Microsoft Word document in which you want to click

54
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.770
Enable editing and it's divided into parts.

55
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.380
As you can see.

56
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:11.380
This is the first table so there's Go ahead press control-C here run new query so make sure that use

57
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.720
console games meaning console games database create table console games not raw but actual console games

58
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.370
that will be working on later in the course.

59
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.350
And then we're just saying insert into console games everything from raw console games.

60
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.550
So again just avoid any mistakes.

61
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.510
I suggest deleting that and putting in your own table here.

62
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.930
So let's go execute it.

63
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.920
As you can see six rows of data were affected.

64
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.540
We can refresh it see what happens here.

65
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.090
Another should be free tables.

66
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.230
We can go ahead and delete rule.

67
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.770
They will usually not want to do that but because we're only learning it just good to delete it so it

68
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.010
doesn't watery anymore.

69
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.960
Now go back to your office file and copy the second part of the code.

70
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.530
It's a bit different from what you usually see.

71
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.960
Can just run equerry it's a bit different because again it's used console games great table console

72
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.640
dates.

73
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.970
But here we also have update their rock concert dates.

74
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.490
So again if you want to avoid any mistakes just copy this one here.

75
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.630
Sorry if this table here and basically what it does because this continued inside of this table we can

76
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.650
see the columns.

77
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.420
This continued is one the platform was taking of the market and not all gaming platforms were taken

78
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.340
of the market yet.

79
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.690
So there weren't any mistakes.

80
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.420
We just want to set it to now and then we just again inserting it.

81
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.970
If you're afraid to make any mistake just delete this.

82
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.720
Just drag and drop this here.

83
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.670
Executed Ariff things right.

84
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.130
As you can see six rows were affected and then €50 were affected.

85
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.870
So now again if we refresh this we can see that there are refresh this we can see there free tables.

86
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.560
We can go ahead delete this one and now we have two tables ready to go ready to be worked out.

87
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.690
I hope you enjoy this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
