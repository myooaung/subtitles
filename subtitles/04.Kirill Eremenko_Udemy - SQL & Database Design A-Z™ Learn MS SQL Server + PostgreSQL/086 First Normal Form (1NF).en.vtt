00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.540
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.720
Today we're finally kicking off the parts about the different normal forms and today we've got the first

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.550
normal form.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.590
Very excited to proceed with this historial.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.930
Let's dive straight into it.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.910
So what is the first thing we're for.

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.550
Well let's look at the definition.

8
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.960
A table is in first normal form if first of all it doesn't contain duplicate rows.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.410
And second every cell contains only one value.

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.110
So let's have a look at an example.

11
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.880
Q Got an example of a table.

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.610
Can you tell me right away if it's in first normal form or not.

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.810
Can we say that this is a table.

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.020
First Normal Form table or not.

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.090
Well the answer is pretty obvious.

16
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.890
This table is not one in F and there's a that's short for first normal form.

17
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.010
And why is it not.

18
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.220
Well because first of all we've got a duplicate row here at the bottom.

19
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.310
Two of those rows are identical.

20
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.240
And second we've got some cells that contain more than one value.

21
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.940
So indeed this is a valid table you could come across the table like this.

22
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.900
But at the same time if the person that creates table wanted to structure in the first normal form then

23
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.310
they wouldn't have these issues that we've outlined with this table.

24
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.280
So the answer to the question is No it doesn't conform.

25
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.620
And the question is now how could we fix this table to make it conform to the first normal form to the

26
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.040
definition to meet that criteria.

27
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.930
And the way to do that is pretty straightforward.

28
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.920
You basically just take remove that duplicate row and then where a person has two phone numbers you

29
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.910
split it out into two rows.

30
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.450
You put that row into two rows and therefore the phone numbers are separated.

31
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.140
And here again this person has two phone numbers and is as you can see we've separated them.

32
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.670
And so now this table doesn't have any duplicate rows and also doesn't have more than one value in each

33
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.330
cell.

34
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.390
So this extension it still counts as part of that phone number because it indeed is part of that phone

35
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.030
number.

36
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.200
So this time it does conform to the first normal form.

37
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.440
So that's pretty simple isn't it.

38
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.680
Very very straightforward.

39
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.130
Well the interesting part about normal forms of tables.

40
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.690
First of all why do we need this normal form why is it important to understand why a table isn't normal

41
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.840
for first animal form or not.

42
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.100
Well because if you know in advance that a tables in first unnormal form you will be sure that there

43
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.430
is no duplicate rows and you will be sure that every cell has only one value.

44
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.150
Right so you won't be worried about those things and that's why it's important to understand when you

45
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.120
deal with a table what what kind of design does it have what kind of scientists this whole database

46
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.600
have that specific table.

47
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.620
And just by knowing that isn't one enough.

48
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.310
Are you confident that there won't be duplicates there won't be more than one value and you can proceed

49
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.960
with your analysis so it gives you information like a standard does this table conform to the standard

50
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.890
or not in this case.

51
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.380
We've made a table that does.

52
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.940
And so the interesting thing about normal forms is that the first form is very easy it's very simple

53
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.600
to understand.

54
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.690
Whereas from there it just gets the difficulty skyrockets so normal form 2 and 3 are will take us quite

55
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.450
some effort to get through we'll definitely get through them.

56
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.990
But Ill will be a challenge to understand them and to remember them and that's why right now I wanted

57
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:30.130
to propose to you that we can come up with four actually we use a mnemonic.

58
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.610
So there's a mnemonic or it's just like a phrase that is used to remember the different normal forms.

59
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.440
So let's have a look at it and then I'll explain in more detail why we're doing.

60
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.950
All right so here's a mnemonic.

61
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.080
And let's quickly read through it.

62
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.990
It says that every non-prime attribute must provide a fact about the key the whole key and nothing but

63
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.830
the key.

64
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.280
Right.

65
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.650
So first of all how did you remember this not going to detail why we need to remember it but the first

66
00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.910
thing we need to do is remember it and how do we do that.

67
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:09.260
Well whenever you are kind of feeling lost in the world of normalization of databases and the normal

68
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.200
forms then just remember me explaining how in American courts they put their hand up and they spece

69
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.630
they say that they pledge to say the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

70
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.500
So you see here the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

71
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.740
Right.

72
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.290
So that's exactly where this Menomonie came from is basically copied from there.

73
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.040
Just so that it's easier to remember.

74
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.580
And there we go now.

75
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.070
Hopefully that's ingrained in your mind forever.

76
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.010
And now let's understand why this is actually helpful to us.

77
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.790
Well if you look at the three different parts about the key right that is associated with the first

78
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.560
normal form.

79
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.970
The whole key is associated with second normal form and nothing but the key is associate third normal

80
00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.180
form.

81
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:06.480
So basically these hints will help you at any point in time recover in your mind.

82
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.140
The criteria for each one of these normal forms.

83
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.170
That's why this isn't what it is useful.

84
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.340
So let's go ahead and try it out on the personal form because we've just done the first and will form

85
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.170
in this trial.

86
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.820
So the concept here is that every non-prime attribute must provide a fact about the key.

87
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.990
And while for the other parts so for the second or from the third point on before this part is important.

88
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.900
Right so every non-prime attribute must and then this other phrase for the first one will form.

89
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.690
It's a bit it's a bit less strict like that for the first and form the most important part here is just

90
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.430
the words about the key.

91
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.450
So that's the most important part.

92
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.580
And basically what that implies.

93
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.200
This sentence that something has to happen something something about the key is implies that there has

94
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.280
to be a key right.

95
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.150
It can in your table there is a key.

96
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.200
And let's look at our definition of a first animal form.

97
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.460
So here.

98
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.520
Well the every cell contains only one value.

99
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.940
Actually Doesn't the mnemonic doesn't help you remember that so you'll have to remember that on your

100
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.390
own.

101
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.830
But basically does that your table doesn't contain duplicate rows.

102
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.250
Right.

103
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.300
Is exactly the same as saying that.

104
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.750
Or is it comes out of saying that the table has a key.

105
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.570
Right so if a table has duplicate rows then it cannot have a key right it cannot have any candidate

106
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:40.160
keys because by definition a candidate key helps you identify rows uniquely.

107
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.100
Right so if you have a candidate key by that candidate key you should be able to identify any role uniquely

108
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.550
But if you have duplicate rows in your table so basically if your table doesn't conform to the one enough

109
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.750
to this condition then you won't have a key.

110
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.070
And that means that this sentence won't be true.

111
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.680
So that's how this mnemonic will help you remember the first normal form.

112
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.470
I know it's a bit it's a bit not as straightforward at this stage.

113
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.790
No.

114
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.680
It might be a bit of vague right now but just remember the phrase remember them mnemonic and remember

115
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.900
that this part is one enough.

116
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.530
And basically it says that it's talking about.

117
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:26.300
The key is talking about a key and that's means that there has to be a key and that key can only exist

118
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.960
if there are no duplicate rows and that will help you remember that.

119
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.660
That's what the one in f is about that it doesn't contain Black Rose and also just You'll have to add

120
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.110
this on on your own that every cell contains only one value.

121
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.530
So there we go.

122
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:48.430
That's what the first animal form is and that's the mnemonic that will help us throughout this rest

123
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.740
of the section and I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and I'll look for your next one.

124
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.150
Until then happy unlet.
