Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,050
And today we'll be talking about structured versus unstructured data.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,430
So when you think about structure data what's the first thing that comes to mind for me it's a table.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,280
Just a simple table with different attributes and tuples filled with proper relation.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,720
That does not contradict any rules that you as a user have said or in the rules of database that a certain

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,320
database have to be preserved certain primary keys and foreign keys have to be assigned and so on.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,120
Now what do you think about unstructured data.

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,170
What was the first thing that comes to mind.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,950
For me it's music movies pictures.

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:50,310
Then it becomes a bit more difficult because if you think about it if structured data is only represented

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,840
by Escuela tables unstructured data is everything else.

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,800
So you can say that Mac Finder window or Windows Explorer is in fact your data.

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,360
And you can even argue that Microsoft Excel is still unstructured data even though it offers such a

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,960
high level of data control of data manipulation.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,620
It is still unstructured data just because Eskew all database gives us so much more control gives us

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,970
so much more efficiency and gives us so much more space to work with the data unstructured data is rich

17
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:31,180
data meaning it contains a lot of information that normally can't be represented neatly on a database.

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,380
And that is good for users because the Loveridge data would you rather read the script of the movie

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,990
or would you rather watch it.

20
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,210
Of course you would rather watch it.

21
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,660
And that's what people prefer.

22
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,810
That's why more than 80 percent of data out there right now is unstructured.

23
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,330
So why do companies still keep using structured data and maintain their Eskew all databases.

24
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,200
Well this is due to the fact that even though unstructured data is so popular it's almost impossible

25
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,220
to manipulate.

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,180
It's almost impossible to get results from it.

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,340
Almost impossible to analyze.

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,590
Now there are more and more services and applications being developed to analyze unstructured data but

29
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,520
the day when we can truly work with rich data as good as we're working we've asked you all databases

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,630
right now is not anywhere near this implicity is the power of structured data.

31
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,090
If you put all the data inside of it correctly and then correct drools and restrains you can perform

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,070
any sort of analysis on it.

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:40,050
Almost always getting the right results so under that vantages of structure data while the first one

34
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:48,120
is data consistency because you put in all the data in a simple table with very defined rules it will

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,920
maintain that way till the end of your project.

36
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,710
And the other thing that you get from using a secure databases is that you can get more information

37
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,040
from the same data just because all of it is neatly organized.

38
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,680
The amount of tools you can use and the demand of analysis you can perform and that data rises significantly.

39
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,210
What is more you have improved data integrity.

40
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:19,650
If you define older rules correctly and if you do not make any user input mistakes then your data will

41
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,760
never be compromised.

42
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,530
There will never be a question of it being lost or corrupted.

43
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,150
And then we also have improved security just because database are much smaller working with text based

44
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,760
files rather than movies and music.

45
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,340
You can assign a lot of security checks Movado sacrificing the efficiency of your database.

46
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:46,470
And finally you have improved maintenance just because your database take Baldwin Hymes less disk space.

47
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,420
It means that your queries can run almost 1000 times quicker and this means you can do regular check

48
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,260
ups on your database anytime you want and you can always know what's happening with your data where

49
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,750
it's stored and you can always perform up to date backups.

50
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,970
So when it comes to data analysis structured data upwards are so much more both in terms of storing

51
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,490
the data and analyzing it that companies will keep using it no matter what users want.

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,580
Because even though users want to see movies and they hear music companies will never sacrifice the

53
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,840
efficiency and the integrity.

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,470
It's much much much easier to work with a text based table where everything is a sign and everything

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:40,760
is in proper place then to work with very huge files filled with data that you cannot possibly organize.

56
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,520
Even though now more and more unstructured data application and tools are being created on the market

57
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:56,130
companies will never give up on structured data for both internal analysis and external I hope you enjoyed

58
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,800
today's lecture and understood the difference between structured and unstructured data.

59
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,290
It is a very very interesting topic and it's definitely the one that's evolving up to this day and it

60
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,230
will be changing even more as time goes.

61
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,810
But again as I said structured data will always be needed and ask Will will always be relevant.

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,650
However if you ever do decide to get into unstructured data that is a very broad topic we have a lot

63
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,240
of interesting points in it.

64
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,440
So I highly recommend taking out.

65
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,360
I hope you enjoyed today's lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
