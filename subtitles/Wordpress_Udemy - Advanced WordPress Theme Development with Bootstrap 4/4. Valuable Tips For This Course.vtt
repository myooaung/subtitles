00:01.050 --> 00:07.890
There this is a lesson that all of you who are taking your first online course here at you than me or

00:07.890 --> 00:11.690
even of those four I didn't know how the youth to the courses work.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.920
If you're already familiar with you the me it's jaws etc..

00:16.140 --> 00:17.890
You can go straight to the next lesson.

00:17.890 --> 00:23.580
But anyway I ask you to watch this lesson as if you like very much to bring some information that you

00:23.580 --> 00:26.880
help you get the most out of this course.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.370
First of all some tips related to the specific course.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.400
Well this course has many lectures with technical content.

00:34.470 --> 00:40.170
They involve programming concepts things that can often generate errors and make you stop what you're

00:40.170 --> 00:44.430
doing to try and solve them in others to help you solve those problems.

00:44.460 --> 00:48.660
I've tried to make this content as interactive as possible.

00:48.690 --> 00:52.480
First they got this lesson here which is right at the beginning of the course.

00:52.630 --> 00:59.380
But first you frequently asked questions before asking if your question has not been answered here.

00:59.380 --> 01:00.030
OK.

01:01.480 --> 01:07.990
Also all lectures that require some additional knowledge have either extra materials or links to some

01:07.990 --> 01:14.590
technical articles you can access these materials by clicking this blue button here on the left side

01:14.590 --> 01:15.820
of the screen.

01:15.880 --> 01:21.190
For example we have this lecture here where we have this link that leads to a WordPress page with more

01:21.190 --> 01:25.130
information about the subject discussed in the lesson.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.510
With that in mind I also provide codes for all of the lessons in this course.

01:30.530 --> 01:36.400
The main purpose of this material is to help you solve problems you may find during the lessons.

01:36.530 --> 01:41.410
On several occasions you'll find errors that only happened on your computer.

01:41.570 --> 01:45.770
Most of the time I realized that these problems are due to typos.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.870
For example function names freedom in the wrong way.

01:49.010 --> 01:55.410
Or even file names created with the wrong name so often the quickest way to solve the specific problems

01:55.460 --> 01:58.750
is to download the code related to specific lesson.

01:58.790 --> 02:05.570
You can replace the excerpts of the code or compare the course code with yours or even replace all your

02:05.570 --> 02:07.870
files with those of course.

02:08.060 --> 02:11.730
You'll notice that all these files are organized into folders.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.510
Each of them are related to one of the lectures OK.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.520
Even though if your doubts persist you can send your questions out to me.

02:20.640 --> 02:25.580
The best way to do this it's to submit the question by clicking this link here.

02:25.890 --> 02:30.670
By doing this you have created a question of history for that particular lesson.

02:30.720 --> 02:37.050
Besides every time you ask the question here I can see exactly what lecture you were watching when your

02:37.070 --> 02:40.590
doubts arose and I can't answer your question much faster.

02:40.590 --> 02:44.260
Right I'm going to create a question here as an example

02:57.210 --> 03:05.340
see that you be notified each time I answer your question which usually takes up to 24 hours.

03:05.340 --> 03:10.920
Another thing you can do and that helps a lot the other students of the Course is to add it to your

03:10.920 --> 03:14.130
question end markets as solved.

03:14.160 --> 03:19.270
To do this just click on the question title click on this small menu here.

03:20.240 --> 03:26.550
Add it Marquez solves and save it.

03:26.770 --> 03:34.370
Another way to access questions and answers is by going straight to the course panel.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.280
You can click directly here.

03:37.380 --> 03:43.260
And here we have the same futures as the other screen where the only difference is that by asking your

03:43.260 --> 03:47.400
question here I will not know which lecture you're referring to.

03:47.730 --> 03:54.570
Then when you can when it's possible tell me which lecture your question refers to that can help me

03:54.660 --> 03:55.470
a lot.

03:56.970 --> 04:01.030
And last but not least let's talk about reviews.

04:01.110 --> 04:07.990
Reviews are a very important way for you to express once you think about the course at the same time.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.700
They help me see what is working and what is wrong with the Course.

04:11.940 --> 04:18.670
This way students who are interested in taking the course can also know if the content is worth it especially

04:18.680 --> 04:20.060
due to this last fact.

04:20.190 --> 04:23.550
I ask you to be fair on your reviews right.

04:23.850 --> 04:28.280
You'll be invited to send your testimonials three times during the course.

04:28.290 --> 04:31.180
The first will be right at the beginning of the course.

04:31.260 --> 04:36.260
The second time how Fe the course and the last one at the end of the course.

04:36.450 --> 04:41.520
If you don't think you're ready to send your review at a given moment for example at the beginning of

04:41.520 --> 04:43.560
the Course just cancer right.

04:43.890 --> 04:50.070
But any time you can also click here on these little stars on the home page of the course and review

04:50.070 --> 04:50.900
it.

04:50.950 --> 04:58.350
Please be objective clear an honest interview and try not to talk about technical problems as well since

04:58.350 --> 05:04.960
you Tommy has an exclusive channel for you to report any technical problem did you like the course.

05:04.970 --> 05:08.590
I am very happy to receive your positive feedback.

05:08.720 --> 05:14.510
Now if you didn't like something especially something that made you give up on the course I ask you

05:14.510 --> 05:18.430
to come and talk to me before publishing your review right.

05:18.470 --> 05:22.670
I worry a lot and I always want to know what is wrong with the course.

05:22.760 --> 05:28.160
I went to see all my students satisfied I went to see them finished the course with the knowledge that

05:28.160 --> 05:30.830
we will really be useful for their lives.

05:30.830 --> 05:37.340
So before you submit your review talk directly to me OK so you can help me make this course more interesting

05:37.340 --> 05:40.370
for you and for all the other students.

05:40.370 --> 05:46.910
I have a colleague here at either me who uses a phrase which is as follows if you like it then talk

05:46.910 --> 05:47.860
about me.

05:47.930 --> 05:52.090
If you don't like it talk to me ok.

05:52.140 --> 05:57.750
I hope you enjoyed the course and that it helps you to acquire the knowledge that you wanted as soon

05:57.780 --> 05:59.740
as you started the course.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.090
I'll be always on hand to help you out.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.430
