00:01.400 --> 00:08.450
Hello guys as we go through the next lessons I will be explaining everything you need to know in order

00:08.450 --> 00:14.510
to get your film ready to Gutenburg this new tool yet to be officially launched by WordPress.

00:14.750 --> 00:19.180
Named after the great German inventor of the printing press.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.980
By the time to record this video.

00:21.050 --> 00:23.250
Good Enberg is still being developed.

00:23.300 --> 00:29.720
The official release is expected for the year 2018 along with wordpress version five point 0.

00:29.990 --> 00:36.770
So maybe if you're watching this video by the end of 2018 or later you don't even need to wonder what

00:36.770 --> 00:37.880
good number is.

00:38.120 --> 00:45.460
But right now that's a question and each answer here basically good Alberg is the new Word Press editor.

00:45.590 --> 00:50.660
Its main goal remains the same of the old editor under the hood.

00:50.840 --> 00:57.620
Content created in the editor is still sent to the same WordPress post table and still retrieved by

00:57.740 --> 01:06.260
the content function within the same loops but it will be unfair to say that it's just the redesign

01:06.260 --> 01:13.400
of the old advertiser the Wordpress team is really expecting to see good Amberg as a watershed in content

01:13.400 --> 01:14.470
creation.

01:14.480 --> 01:22.010
It's a new way of thinking about the content and this richness as a whole new tentative for which content

01:22.010 --> 01:29.690
creation for pages posts and custom post types within the CMOS WordPress prompts is that creating content

01:29.690 --> 01:35.500
with this new tool will become much faster easier and without mysteries.

01:35.630 --> 01:40.750
That is why we have so much buzz around the official release.

01:41.330 --> 01:46.690
Well if it is going to be easier or not only time will tell for now.

01:46.790 --> 01:53.140
Like everything you good Albert has been causing a bit of controversy mainly because let's be real.

01:53.180 --> 01:56.730
It's really annoying and complicated to do with changes.

01:56.990 --> 01:58.830
That's part of being human.

01:58.910 --> 02:05.750
If you look at the Wordpress plugins repository very good Amberg is already available as a plugin before

02:05.750 --> 02:06.730
the official release.

02:06.730 --> 02:10.190
Of course we should then bring it into the core.

02:10.190 --> 02:13.910
Look most people don't feel satisfied.

02:13.910 --> 02:21.110
Bugs are still crucial for the project as you see as we go through the lessons but we're still at the

02:21.110 --> 02:21.840
beginning.

02:21.870 --> 02:24.980
Good work is still evolving over the next lessons.

02:24.980 --> 02:31.940
My goal will be to explain how good work works will understand its basic functions only the main ones

02:31.940 --> 02:32.690
are cases.

02:32.690 --> 02:36.450
Reason number one as the tool was still evolving.

02:36.470 --> 02:41.190
New features will be incorporated with time and reason number two.

02:41.210 --> 02:47.890
This course is more focused on developers so we are going to limit ourselves here to explaining what

02:47.910 --> 02:50.360
will change from the developers point of view.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.590
Not the end user's point of view.

02:52.600 --> 02:59.300
Right but anyway the basic Futurist I am going to show you your ready help you stand on your own two

02:59.300 --> 02:59.640
feet.

02:59.660 --> 03:06.650
As good Amberg evolves the main structures here will be that will grab the theme that we're developing

03:06.710 --> 03:14.620
in this course and see what more we need to add to say in the end that the theme is good Amberg ready.

03:14.780 --> 03:21.050
You see that it's not so difficult and you'll be able to offer a theme whether for your client or anywhere

03:21.050 --> 03:24.080
else you can say it's ready for good Amber.

03:24.440 --> 03:30.740
As I said before this is an evolving tool than possibly new lessons to be added to the course.

03:30.770 --> 03:35.620
If there is any other functionality that impacts your work as a developer.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.430
So stay tuned.

03:37.700 --> 03:42.610
Well I talked too much but it didn't show anything to you until now.

03:42.620 --> 03:49.250
In this first lesson then I'll start by installing and enabling Gutenburg in our WordPress installation.

03:49.430 --> 03:56.150
By the time our record is video WordPress version four point nine point eight has just been released.

03:56.390 --> 04:02.360
So this version is showing this invitation right here on the dashboard inviting users to get to know

04:02.360 --> 04:09.830
the new publishing too so you can be sure that your client will want to know what this little thing

04:09.830 --> 04:16.440
here is so soon your theme you'll need to comply with the latest requirement I say.

04:16.530 --> 04:23.870
But there is no reason to panic right now you have the options to install good here by clicking this

04:23.870 --> 04:27.360
button which says Install Gorenberg.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.530
Also download it directly from the plugin repository.

04:30.710 --> 04:37.970
Which means also go into plugins add new search for good work

04:40.990 --> 04:42.280
and it's going to be here.

04:43.150 --> 04:49.750
If you're reading using WordPress 5.0 there is no need to do this since Gramberg will be included by

04:49.750 --> 04:51.780
default in wordpress.

04:51.790 --> 04:59.990
However if we go back here to the home page you see that we can continue using the classic editor which

05:00.010 --> 05:03.490
still uses the tiny MC extension.

05:03.490 --> 05:11.120
I believe that from version 5 point all on words there should also be a way to choose whether or not

05:11.170 --> 05:12.500
you use good Amberg.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.110
No one knows exactly at the moment.

05:15.550 --> 05:18.390
Well lets start off first.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.610
It's always recommended to back up your installation.

05:21.610 --> 05:26.120
OK never know I'm going to click here to install good MBR

05:31.750 --> 05:40.340
and as soon as I click activate this demo page appears and this is good Hamburg howre new editor.

05:42.780 --> 05:51.100
And here's an interesting thing if you compare this new look and the classic editor it's not 30 others

05:51.150 --> 05:56.530
or has been only redesigned it's been totally revisited.

05:56.880 --> 06:03.990
Gutenberg is totally different from the classic tiny MC editor and if you scroll down to see the content

06:04.740 --> 06:12.510
you'll see a lot of things that it couldn't get before using the old classic editor for example image

06:12.510 --> 06:14.400
galleries like this one

06:19.520 --> 06:22.190
or a full size image like this.

06:23.870 --> 06:27.060
Or a full size video indeed.

06:27.150 --> 06:31.650
A lot of fantastic stuff when compared to the old Adager.

06:31.750 --> 06:37.070
In fact those things were possible but it was more difficult to achieve all this.

06:37.930 --> 06:46.060
We needed to rely on short calls but then we could only see the code in the editor but not its result

06:46.070 --> 06:47.790
inside the screen.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.240
As you can now I haven't needed to use plugins.

06:51.430 --> 06:55.470
Good Enberg is common to change that making things more clear.

06:55.510 --> 07:01.420
Like feeling bad for example a lot of people used unnecessary plugins for this.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.560
Now the process is more clear.

07:03.760 --> 07:12.340
Just add a block and you're done in a way the editor looks a lot like those page builders like the builder

07:12.860 --> 07:19.930
elementary visual composer and others good Hamburgh is not going to replace page builders even because

07:20.290 --> 07:27.160
it's not common to put anyone out of business as the Wordpress team has already stated and it's quite

07:27.160 --> 07:28.100
the opposite.

07:28.180 --> 07:34.840
It's coming to evolve WordPress So there's more business to be had in the future for everyone so it

07:34.840 --> 07:41.570
won't replace page builders but in a way it will bring a similar experience for the user.

07:41.650 --> 07:48.730
But before your theme needs to be prepared to use all this in the best possible way.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.930
That's what we start learning in the next lessons.

07:53.410 --> 07:56.440
Well see you then in the next lesson and you'll then.
