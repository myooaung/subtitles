00:01.150 --> 00:08.460
Whether in today's lesson you're going to start talking about sidebars in this first lesson.

00:08.470 --> 00:13.740
You're going to start creating the structure for these design elements which are very important in a

00:13.740 --> 00:14.950
WordPress theme.

00:15.330 --> 00:19.990
But before we start you may have noticed that our theme is a bit different.

00:20.070 --> 00:23.620
Now the theme is a bit more like our initial layout.

00:23.670 --> 00:28.980
The one we presented at the beginning of the Course the top bar is already with the color we defined

00:29.030 --> 00:29.900
initially.

00:30.090 --> 00:36.900
The menu is already a little bigger etc. but before you start complaining and there's always someone

00:36.900 --> 00:44.100
that will complain I'm sure as I said since the beginning of the course we will not focus on HCM male

00:44.250 --> 00:51.450
and CSSA here in the course despite the fact that you really need HGL male and CSSA beauty of Wordpress

00:51.450 --> 00:52.130
theme.

00:52.170 --> 00:58.170
I think the most important in the course like this one here is to explain the Wordpress way of doing

00:58.170 --> 00:58.940
things.

00:59.160 --> 01:06.000
So for the moment I'm not going to record lessons explaining what I did in terms of CSSA for example

01:06.030 --> 01:08.230
how it's changed colors.

01:08.460 --> 01:14.130
That's the basics of web development which is not the focus of this course.

01:14.220 --> 01:21.160
If we did that it would take you a long time to learn what I think is the most essential here wishes

01:21.210 --> 01:24.060
explain how a thing works.

01:24.120 --> 01:28.590
However you can see all the changes I've made in the files.

01:28.590 --> 01:32.100
I'll make them all available for download as you know.

01:32.340 --> 01:36.330
All the files are available in the second lecture of this course.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.360
Everything organized by lesson.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.650
So go ahead and download the files.

01:40.890 --> 01:43.740
And there you can see the changes OK.

01:44.720 --> 01:50.170
So here in the success file I have the code a bit more organized.

01:50.330 --> 01:53.510
Here we have our Google phone call.

01:53.660 --> 02:02.080
So minor changes to the heading elements the background colors the style for each section of the site.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.670
Anyway several style changes.

02:04.700 --> 02:11.690
Only very simple CSSA modifications nothing very special and other modification is here in the functions

02:11.690 --> 02:12.460
file.

02:12.470 --> 02:15.170
I just changed the order of the incudes files.

02:15.170 --> 02:22.100
First we got the bootstrap files and then our template that says file given the nature of says this

02:22.100 --> 02:22.830
will for us.

02:22.880 --> 02:29.720
And he says US rule from our own sources file should be more important than the bootstraps sucess rules.

02:29.720 --> 02:36.260
So for example if you want to override any bootstrap role using our template or CSSA file will be able

02:36.260 --> 02:40.150
to do that if we head over to the content files.

02:40.220 --> 02:47.480
You see that I've implemented that suggestion I gave you in the last lesson I've included the post class

02:47.480 --> 02:56.570
function here within each article and using only sources and styled each both formats in different way

02:56.930 --> 03:00.060
using the class relative to each post FIRMAT.

03:00.230 --> 03:06.560
If you had the curiosity to implement the suggestion I gave you in the last lesson you must have understood

03:06.560 --> 03:07.860
how it works.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.290
If you didn't go ahead and give it a try that would be a very good exercise.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.340
Well let's go over to the blog page

03:21.360 --> 03:28.320
here in the blog list and page you can see that the post which have the video post format are different

03:28.320 --> 03:30.090
from the ones with the image.

03:30.090 --> 03:31.040
Post FIRMAT

03:33.920 --> 03:40.110
the default post formats have a heading tag with a different color to changing the heading colors is

03:40.160 --> 03:45.340
a very simple idea if you can remember the examples I showed you in the last lesson.

03:45.410 --> 03:48.230
We can have even more advanced changes

03:50.910 --> 03:55.720
also as you can see there is a new div here called meta info.

03:55.950 --> 03:59.940
Actually it has been added to all the content files.

03:59.970 --> 04:06.420
This will serve as a wrapper and help us style the first paragraphs which contains the date the author

04:06.600 --> 04:08.530
categories and tags.

04:10.330 --> 04:17.340
I've used this wrapper just to apply this great color to these links here and to make the text bolder.

04:17.620 --> 04:24.310
So it's only success in a couple of Jamail modifications that were really special and nothing related

04:24.310 --> 04:26.200
to WordPress itself.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.990
That said you're going to start creating our sidebars.

04:31.180 --> 04:35.460
But before that let's explain what those sidebars are OK.

04:35.770 --> 04:38.940
For this let's just switch things for a moment.

04:41.950 --> 04:47.770
This time I'll be working with the 2016 thing which is one of the native WordPress themes.

04:49.730 --> 04:54.060
You see that on the right side we have this big area here.

04:54.290 --> 04:57.010
Here in this area we have some features.

04:57.230 --> 05:02.670
We have a search bar and Neriah with recent topics comments.

05:02.870 --> 05:11.600
The whole area is what WordPress calls a sidebar and within that sidebar each small element has a functionality

05:11.870 --> 05:13.770
it's called a widget.

05:13.770 --> 05:20.600
We'll be learning about these two elements sidebars and widgets in this lesson and in next one you'll

05:20.600 --> 05:26.900
notice during the course that we can create and position than practically anywhere in the thing.

05:26.980 --> 05:34.460
This by the name of this element sidebar we can place them anywhere not just on the left or on the right

05:34.460 --> 05:35.750
side of the theme.

05:35.900 --> 05:43.990
So the first thing we're going to do is open up the functions file in the same way that we have previously

05:44.080 --> 05:44.850
registered.

05:44.860 --> 05:52.090
Our menus are going to register our sidebars for the scores you're going to first register choose sidebars

05:52.570 --> 05:56.290
but you can register several sidebars for a single thing.

05:56.290 --> 05:59.920
Let's create a sidebar that will be displayed on the home page.

06:00.070 --> 06:04.200
And the second sidebar that will be displayed only on the inner pages.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.200
More specifically on the blog page.

06:07.390 --> 06:13.130
For now we only have 80 email markup in both areas but nothing is happening here.

06:13.210 --> 06:17.840
Once we've created sidebars we can add whatever we just want.

06:17.950 --> 06:24.460
For example here in the home page we can add a text widget and later on we're going to add a contact

06:24.460 --> 06:32.440
for an on the blog page we can add widgets to display the latest polls for example but they can add

06:32.440 --> 06:34.970
whatever elements we want in there.

06:35.780 --> 06:42.650
Sidebars are futures that can bring a lot of dynamics to the same ones you create in the end user can

06:42.650 --> 06:49.490
put whatever they want in there making their websites totally different from another one that uses the

06:49.490 --> 06:51.200
same theme for example.

06:51.290 --> 06:53.020
Ok enough small talk.

06:53.140 --> 06:57.570
Let's get down to business so let's get back to our functions file.

06:58.790 --> 07:04.910
This time we want to register our sidebars outside of the main configuration function.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.980
Let's start by adding a new action

07:10.660 --> 07:12.700
that's best to this action.

07:12.860 --> 07:18.980
Call which widgets in its And lets trigger a new function on that hook.

07:19.390 --> 07:25.980
Let's call this function learn W.P. underscore sidebars.

07:26.020 --> 07:30.510
Notice that this function doesn't exist yet and you'll be creating it.

07:31.420 --> 07:36.140
In fact you are doing the opposite of what we have been doing previously.

07:36.190 --> 07:41.750
We first created the functions and then added an action but no problem at all here.

07:41.800 --> 07:48.290
Changing the order of the factors doesn't change the product.

07:48.390 --> 08:00.640
Now let's go ahead and create a function so function learn W.P. underscore sideburns and then it lets

08:00.640 --> 08:04.530
begin registering our first Ciber to do this.

08:04.660 --> 08:07.530
We want to use a function called register sidebar

08:11.690 --> 08:13.050
inside that function.

08:13.070 --> 08:14.090
We create an array

08:17.660 --> 08:23.660
and in disarray we pass some arguments which I'm going to explain to you one by one.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.520
First one is called name.

08:26.540 --> 08:30.260
This is a title that you display in the admin area.

08:30.260 --> 08:34.290
For example let's go to a perience

08:38.170 --> 08:42.350
widgets.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.050
This one here

08:47.400 --> 08:52.890
let's separate each item of the array with a comma and on the new line.

08:53.030 --> 08:58.810
Let's pass the second argument which is called Id pay a lot of attention here.

08:58.810 --> 08:59.290
OK.

08:59.440 --> 09:07.690
Because this idea must be unique as you're going to register choose sideburn each ID argument needs

09:07.690 --> 09:09.180
to be different.

09:09.260 --> 09:12.820
Also avoid the use of special characters here or spaces.

09:12.840 --> 09:16.730
OK let's consider this value as a variable.

09:16.750 --> 09:25.780
This way we don't make any mistake the next argument is description this argument corresponds to a short

09:25.780 --> 09:29.260
description that also appears in the abdomen area.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.340
This one here

09:38.680 --> 09:45.430
OK all the arguments we've passed so far will be used in the dashboard when we are inside the widgets

09:45.430 --> 09:46.310
page.

09:46.510 --> 09:51.370
The remaining arguments refer to the display of which we did individually.

09:51.370 --> 09:57.970
The first one in this category is called before on the square widget let's just type in the argument

09:58.060 --> 10:00.160
and pass an empty value for now.

10:04.220 --> 10:08.360
And the next one is after underscore widget.

10:08.630 --> 10:09.140
Same thing.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.040
Let's just pass an empty value.

10:12.770 --> 10:14.610
Do you understand what they are for.

10:14.690 --> 10:20.450
I need to use some visual aids that let's go back to our 20:16 theme

10:24.950 --> 10:33.310
if we inspect each widget in the sidebar you'll notice that it has a well defined structure each widget

10:33.570 --> 10:39.200
is inside the wrapper element which in this case is the nature section.

10:39.220 --> 10:43.250
Each section has its ID and it CSSA class.

10:43.330 --> 10:51.480
We also notice here that they all have a heading element all heading our age style.

10:52.030 --> 10:57.570
Now we get very important information for the other arguments we are going to be using in the survey.

10:59.300 --> 11:05.420
For the before rigid arguments we pass the H UML elements that serve as a wrapper for each side bar

11:05.420 --> 11:08.440
widget for 2016.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.330
We saw then a section tag was chosen.

11:11.330 --> 11:16.890
In our case let's pass a DIV tag with the widget wrapper class.

11:17.120 --> 11:21.750
It can be much more specific and include CSSA ID for example.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.550
But for this lesson let's make it simpler.

11:24.890 --> 11:31.250
If you want you can take a look at the native WordPress themes and check out how they do that for the.

11:31.260 --> 11:38.480
After we did it just closed the HCM Altaic we opened above the last two arguments will be respectively

11:38.840 --> 11:40.520
before underscored title

11:44.410 --> 11:46.510
and after the score title

11:49.720 --> 11:56.800
4 before title we passed the heading tag for each sidebar which it last best to tag with a class called

11:56.910 --> 11:57.460
Widgets.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.060
Title

12:00.680 --> 12:02.770
and in after title.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.790
Let's close out the H2 tag.

12:05.790 --> 12:06.400
All right.

12:06.530 --> 12:14.230
We have all the structure in each register and use our first sideburn as coverture dashboard and activate

12:14.320 --> 12:15.680
our theme again.

12:20.430 --> 12:29.910
And now if we over over the appearance menu we have the widgets option and click on that and here on

12:29.910 --> 12:33.200
the right side it can see the side by recreated.

12:33.870 --> 12:39.480
As I explained you got here the way its title and description.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.470
Great isn't it.

12:40.800 --> 12:45.070
Yes it's so cool that we're going to create one more sidebar.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.120
This time it will be used on the blog page to do this.

12:49.110 --> 12:50.490
It's very easy.

12:50.490 --> 12:54.470
We just copy this entire register sidebar function.

12:54.900 --> 12:59.510
Be very careful because when you copy that semicolon to you OK.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.770
And let's face everything down here.

13:01.800 --> 13:08.000
After that semicolon now we just need to change some values here.

13:08.270 --> 13:09.760
Let's go ahead and change the name

13:13.030 --> 13:17.020
the ID and the description of the second sidebar.

13:19.300 --> 13:26.620
Rest of the code may look the same but if you wish you can change both the tags and the radius of each

13:26.620 --> 13:28.920
element let's say all this

13:33.950 --> 13:35.750
and no in the dashboard.

13:35.750 --> 13:42.240
We have the second sidebar Well that's it for this lesson in the next lesson.

13:42.240 --> 13:48.270
We will continue to talk about sidebars you stoon that you place the sidebars within the theme and that's

13:48.270 --> 13:50.640
what you'll be learning how to do.

13:50.640 --> 13:51.880
See you later.

13:51.990 --> 13:52.820
And happy coding.
