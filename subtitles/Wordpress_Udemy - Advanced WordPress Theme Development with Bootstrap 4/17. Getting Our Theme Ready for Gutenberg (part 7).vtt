Hey guys everything ok.

00:04.350 --> 00:11.220
Marcelo here again this is our last lesson about Gutenburg over the last lesson here learned the basics

00:11.220 --> 00:19.080
about this new word press tool which will gradually replace the editor used so far the tiny MCE WordPress

00:19.080 --> 00:23.520
promises that he'll bring a whole new world to the CMOS.

00:23.550 --> 00:29.230
So much so they they dare to name it after the inventor of the printing press.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.350
Good Amberg.

00:30.630 --> 00:34.830
From what you've seen Gorenberg is really a very powerful tool.

00:35.010 --> 00:41.670
And it looks like it's coming to stay despite the fact that while record this video with America still

00:41.670 --> 00:46.090
has some bugs and hasn't been yet officially released.

00:46.230 --> 00:53.100
We hope that the Wordpress versions after 5.0 showed that the effort was worth it.

00:53.100 --> 01:00.300
There are great expectations and new futures are still to be developed over time for the students of

01:00.300 --> 01:00.990
this course.

01:00.990 --> 01:07.570
My promise is that if any of the new features impact film development I will certainly talk about them.

01:07.890 --> 01:15.360
But as I told you earlier functionalities that have to do and affect only the end user want be the focus

01:15.540 --> 01:16.210
of this course.

01:16.220 --> 01:23.010
OK but just for you to have another taste I'll show you some more cool features that we have here in

01:23.010 --> 01:24.070
Gutenburg.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.380
First here is towbar.

01:26.460 --> 01:32.340
We have this little menu and clicking here shows you a number of interesting actions related to the

01:32.340 --> 01:33.580
document.

01:33.660 --> 01:39.750
For example you can switch between the visual editor and the HMO editor.

01:39.750 --> 01:43.350
This can be very useful for you the developer.

01:43.350 --> 01:47.430
Its also a good way to learn a little more about how the blocks are controlled.

01:47.430 --> 01:55.410
Inside the editor here we have for example a comment that identifies the block itself and we got values

01:55.440 --> 02:01.610
in Jason FIRMAT which are used to save the values for the settings that you pass to each block.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.540
Let's go back to the video editor

02:07.790 --> 02:12.820
another very interesting thing you can do is create re-usable blocks.

02:12.860 --> 02:19.550
Let's assume that the user wants to apply the same settings on all buttons that he or she creates in

02:19.550 --> 02:23.220
posts and pages they can create the first button.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.300
Access does block action menu.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.390
And click on Add to reusable blocks.

02:31.970 --> 02:32.770
Type the name

02:35.670 --> 02:42.430
and now the next time the user adds a button block he or she can only choose these reusable blocks from

02:42.430 --> 02:43.170
here.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.500
Or if you use anything Surtur come here.

02:49.590 --> 02:54.800
And the re-useable just the template that created it isn't it.

02:55.150 --> 02:58.040
And this is the same for several elements.

02:59.250 --> 03:07.620
Another interesting thing is this information button you have here a statistic about the document words

03:08.500 --> 03:11.140
paragraphs and here below.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.980
If we for example add a new heading here

03:17.430 --> 03:25.490
you see the semantic structure of the document quite interesting for the ones who care so much about

03:25.670 --> 03:26.600
SEO.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.800
Well what's your next step from here.

03:29.810 --> 03:37.130
I believe that started doing some tests with the theme make a backup of the installation which is always

03:37.130 --> 03:44.600
good and then installing test Gutenburg on your theme before finally offering it to your client.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.890
But just do it right.

03:46.940 --> 03:51.780
Good Amberg is coming to stay and soon your client will start asking about it.

03:51.800 --> 03:57.760
Another interesting thing you could also learn is how to create your own blocks for Gutenburg.

03:57.890 --> 04:04.850
I want discuss the subject on this course right because it has more to do with plug in development and

04:04.850 --> 04:11.570
this course is not about plug development but it may also be interested in the subject and create your

04:11.660 --> 04:12.720
own blocks.

04:12.850 --> 04:18.230
Just like many developers today that create plugins for their own things.

04:18.290 --> 04:24.500
The official Gutenberg Handbook has a very complete their communication on the subject and I'll leave

04:24.500 --> 04:27.660
the link for you to find out more about it of course.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.590
Well folks that's it.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.450
I hope you enjoyed the lessons.

04:31.460 --> 04:38.450
It was really cool for me to talk about this new world press your depending on when you're watching

04:38.450 --> 04:39.340
this video.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.060
It is not so new.

04:41.360 --> 04:45.790
But I'm sure that the lessons should have helped you a lot.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.230
Well until then I see you next time.
