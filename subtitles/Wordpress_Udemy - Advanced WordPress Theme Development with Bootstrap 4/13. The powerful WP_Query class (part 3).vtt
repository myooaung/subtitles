00:01.190 --> 00:08.330
Hello and the last lesson we created our custom No but it still doesn't print out any information on

00:08.330 --> 00:09.140
screen.

00:09.200 --> 00:16.160
So what we're going to do today is tell Wordpress which feels we want to be fashed from each post.

00:16.310 --> 00:19.490
To begin this lesson let's take a look at our lay.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.900
Well let's understand first what we want.

00:24.890 --> 00:32.510
Humidifying that we want to post the image let's call it the future image and just below the author

00:32.510 --> 00:39.640
link category tags the publication date and finally the post excerpt.

00:39.640 --> 00:48.140
That is the first 55 words from the editor of content textarea followed by Alix's a couple more information

00:48.200 --> 00:50.210
before we begin.

00:50.240 --> 00:58.190
If you look at the dashboard in our post table it's open one of the posts for example this first post

00:58.190 --> 01:00.180
from the web design category.

01:01.590 --> 01:08.430
I've made some modifications to the content but nothing so important only that the content it's a little

01:08.430 --> 01:09.090
different.

01:09.210 --> 01:17.310
And also that there is a future image for every post from the web design and the Web development categories

01:18.330 --> 01:20.660
those modifications are only truly straight.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.070
What you're going to learn today.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.120
Right.

01:24.340 --> 01:32.120
Again going back to subline text to make her look cleaner so that the code itself becomes more readable.

01:32.120 --> 01:38.870
We're going to use that get template part function we learned in previous lessons so let's do the following.

01:38.870 --> 01:41.370
Let's close the beach be tag here.

01:41.420 --> 01:49.010
After the post since it is from here that the post content will be brought and forgotten to reopen the

01:49.010 --> 01:50.590
tag just below.

01:50.930 --> 01:57.680
So the content to be inserted here in the middle that is everything that is here at this point.

01:57.740 --> 02:03.050
As you already know will be repeated because here we've cut a loop.

02:03.350 --> 02:06.240
Let's go ahead and open a divide here.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.760
Let's pass the code 12 class here.

02:10.640 --> 02:17.840
As I have already explained to you this future news occupied the full width of the new row we created.

02:18.840 --> 02:24.630
Inside that div Let's call the Gets templates part function and let's pass two parameters

02:27.690 --> 02:35.970
the first one is going to be template hyphen parts forward slash content and the second one is going

02:35.970 --> 02:38.220
to be featured.

02:38.360 --> 02:45.220
That is we'll have to create a new file inside the template parse folder called content HIF and features

02:45.330 --> 02:46.850
that THP.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.450
As for this file then

02:53.690 --> 02:56.370
OK what do you have in this file.

02:56.580 --> 03:00.840
Well we want to make space to bring the post featured image.

03:00.870 --> 03:04.290
The author is link to category tags.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.670
The publication date and the excerpt.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.540
Split things up a bit.

03:08.640 --> 03:13.440
Let's copy everything from the content that page file and paste in that new file.

03:14.310 --> 03:18.160
Hence we have to write less code.

03:18.180 --> 03:21.580
Let's add one more CSSA class to the stack here.

03:22.620 --> 03:27.440
To do that I'm going to create an array inside this post class function.

03:27.600 --> 03:34.640
Add an argument code class and set its value to future.

03:34.840 --> 03:41.200
By doing this along with the CSSA class is generated other medically by the post class function will

03:41.220 --> 03:52.280
have one more code future as great a native load or thumbnail and Lescott that coats may be related

03:52.280 --> 03:57.340
to the thumbnail and we want to make some changes here.

03:59.500 --> 04:08.040
For the size Let's Fasti large parameter and for the image to be responsive Let's create an array here

04:08.130 --> 04:09.770
including the class argument.

04:11.630 --> 04:20.260
And its value is going to be I N G hyphen fluid that will cause a bootstrap class call.

04:20.300 --> 04:27.330
I am the fluid to be included and thus make our image responsive now down here.

04:27.330 --> 04:33.110
Let's change the order of the fuse a bit within a single paragraph.

04:33.110 --> 04:38.120
We're going to include each field we want each of them inside of.

04:54.750 --> 04:55.450
OK.

04:55.490 --> 05:02.140
Notice here that the publication date went down and we only have a single paragraph tag.

05:02.450 --> 05:09.900
Also notice that for the text function we added a less parameter including here the close in its UML

05:09.890 --> 05:11.040
span tag.

05:11.300 --> 05:17.350
This function accepts three parameters and we can add eight shemale tags here on the first.

05:17.420 --> 05:22.850
And on the last Brander's OK one more modification here.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.950
Instead of the food count.

05:25.090 --> 05:28.570
We only want the excerpts to do this.

05:28.570 --> 05:31.300
We replace the content with the excerpt.

05:32.210 --> 05:32.650
OK.

05:32.660 --> 05:33.890
Let's say this.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.880
And let's see if Finally we get end results.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.440
Belongs in the home page

05:44.510 --> 05:48.190
here we got the image and the other fields too.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.800
Let's just check if it's really the post we want.

05:55.050 --> 05:55.580
See.

05:55.730 --> 06:02.420
And as we excluded the social media category from our look remember what appears on the page is the

06:02.420 --> 06:05.570
first post from the web design category.

06:07.580 --> 06:12.180
OK let's see if the maze is indeed responsive.

06:12.180 --> 06:17.280
Go ahead and press control shift I are on a Mac command option.

06:17.300 --> 06:20.930
I click here.

06:26.100 --> 06:30.680
And see that the image is really responsive.

06:30.950 --> 06:34.530
The next step now is to bring the Jews secondary news.

06:34.700 --> 06:41.160
For this we will have to create a second loop here on the same page as you'll notice.

06:41.180 --> 06:47.420
This is only possible use an alternative such as the W.P. Querrey class but that's a subject for our

06:47.420 --> 06:48.640
next lesson.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.360
And then happy calling.
