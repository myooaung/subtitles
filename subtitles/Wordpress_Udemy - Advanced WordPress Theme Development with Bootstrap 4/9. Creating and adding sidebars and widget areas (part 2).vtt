00:01.210 --> 00:02.550
Hey what's up guys.

00:02.620 --> 00:08.970
We're back here with another lesson in the last lesson we started building our first sideburn.

00:09.100 --> 00:15.040
We stopped at the point where we were building the structure of each of our two sidebars.

00:15.130 --> 00:20.280
Notice here in the widget manager that we already have the two sidebars area created.

00:20.470 --> 00:25.100
However if we add some widgets in this outburst nothing will happen.

00:25.300 --> 00:31.110
Let's for example where the text widget in the sideboard is going to be placed on the themes home page

00:33.710 --> 00:36.730
at a title and some random text here.

00:41.760 --> 00:47.370
Let's say now if you look at the home page.

00:47.370 --> 00:48.660
Nothing has changed yet.

00:50.350 --> 00:55.440
The same thing will happen with a sidebar that's going to add on the blog page.

00:55.450 --> 01:01.220
The problem as always is that we need to tell WordPress where our sidebars will be placed.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.570
And this has to be done inside some template file.

01:04.870 --> 01:10.000
So let's start by creating a new file here in our theme's folder.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.110
This file will be called sidebar on the page be

01:16.170 --> 01:19.060
inside this file you're going to add the following code.

01:21.190 --> 01:33.360
If it's active sidebar sidebar 1 what we are doing here is testing if there is any active widget inside

01:33.390 --> 01:34.590
our Sidebar.

01:34.740 --> 01:37.620
If it's true let's call a function here.

01:37.870 --> 01:50.890
Dynamic sidebar sidebar One is if there's an active widget in the sidebar named sidebar one we load

01:50.890 --> 01:52.860
the contents of that sidebar.

01:53.150 --> 01:57.400
Excellent but it's not ready for this new file to be useful.

01:57.440 --> 02:01.440
You have to include it somewhere on our screen but where.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.830
Well let's start with the home page.

02:03.830 --> 02:08.930
We want to include our new file here where you see the sidebar text of course.

02:09.320 --> 02:13.830
OK but how do we require a file that contains a sidebar.

02:13.880 --> 02:20.090
Very simple just use of Wordpress function called Get underscore sidebar

02:22.970 --> 02:27.230
by doing so when we're below the home page we will see some results.

02:28.870 --> 02:34.770
Look we have a text widget with a title and also with content that we added on the widget.

02:35.230 --> 02:35.620
Great.

02:35.630 --> 02:43.400
Now how can we do the same for the second site you are the one that we want to display on the blog page.

02:43.450 --> 02:46.950
Do we need to use the same site speech file.

02:46.960 --> 02:52.280
Is it possible to create choose Yardbird that page be files one for each sidebar.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.420
And my answer is yes.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.230
In order for this to work let's rename the sidebar that page before.

02:59.560 --> 03:07.690
Now it'll be called sidebar HIF and home that page B we will only use this file to add the sidebar of

03:07.690 --> 03:09.390
the home page template.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.080
Sounds obvious doesn't it.

03:11.210 --> 03:14.210
It's because it's really obvious.

03:14.350 --> 03:18.900
Let's copy the entire contents of this file and paste it into a new file.

03:23.540 --> 03:31.920
This one will be called sidebar hive and blog dot page be now.

03:31.950 --> 03:35.550
Just replace the name of the sidebar inside this new file.

03:35.550 --> 03:41.970
Otherwise it will load the same sidebar as the home page and it's not what we want.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.210
Now I have two files one of them adds a sidebar to the home page template.

03:47.340 --> 03:53.550
The other one adds the second Sagger to only be displayed on the blog page.

03:53.640 --> 04:00.070
Now to finish out when you pass the string to the sidebar function here in the page home that page B

04:00.120 --> 04:08.850
file we add the word home inside to get side bar function Skop it is here.

04:09.430 --> 04:16.990
And ending the X-File let's face what we just copied here at the point where we want to call the sidebar.

04:16.990 --> 04:23.630
Just take care to change the name of the template which shall now be blog that is here at this point.

04:23.740 --> 04:33.570
The file included is this one here sidebar hyphen blog that PH BE now our problems are solved.

04:34.050 --> 04:36.290
Let's head over to our dashboard.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.120
And you add some widgets to the blog page Ciber.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.270
That's an archive widget

04:52.320 --> 05:01.770
and category's widget.

05:01.770 --> 05:02.490
Now let's see

05:06.540 --> 05:08.650
here on the home page we have the text.

05:08.670 --> 05:12.110
We did and on the blog page.

05:12.210 --> 05:15.280
We have the two widgets we just added.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.640
Very cool.

05:17.100 --> 05:22.590
See how much power this site bring to the site owner with them.

05:22.590 --> 05:26.780
The user can add whatever we he or she wants.

05:26.820 --> 05:33.200
They can even download their favorite widgets or plugins and use them as they wish.

05:33.780 --> 05:35.220
OK you finish this lesson.

05:35.310 --> 05:38.520
Let's make three more modifications here first.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.840
How about we change the sidebar here.

05:41.010 --> 05:43.310
Let's move it to the right side of the page.

05:45.530 --> 05:46.590
Right to do that.

05:46.670 --> 05:54.950
I'm going to cut this aside Steg and paste it after this closing div tag subline text makes this really

05:55.010 --> 05:59.520
easy since it shows me exactly where this div ends.

06:02.390 --> 06:07.910
The second modification that we want to do is get rid of the elements we don't want on the block page

06:07.940 --> 06:15.050
for example on the blog page we don't want the slide section and also the services section here.

06:15.260 --> 06:20.750
They'll only be displayed on the home page so I'll go ahead and remove these elements here.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.300
So I don't want them here.

06:25.430 --> 06:33.330
And the last one let's add a bootstrap for class to a side element called age 100.

06:33.330 --> 06:39.150
This you cause the height of the settlements not to spend the entire height of the page.

06:39.200 --> 06:46.620
We can do the same for the A-side tag on the page home page file OK.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.340
Excellent.

06:47.510 --> 06:54.310
Let's save reload page perfect.

06:54.320 --> 06:58.480
It's working.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.180
Some things implements side bars in a different way.

07:02.180 --> 07:06.560
For example if we open the 20:17 thing you'll notice that.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.690
First of all it performs a check here.

07:09.710 --> 07:17.210
It's saying the following if the sidebar named sidebar one is not active notice the page being not operator

07:17.750 --> 07:21.370
return that is do nothing else.

07:21.410 --> 07:28.930
If we get this far we do have widgets and then it actually includes the sidebar inside and the size

07:28.930 --> 07:29.820
tag.

07:29.990 --> 07:35.470
In our case we choose to add the side stack outside of the side bar fire itself.

07:35.690 --> 07:38.910
So the size stack will always be displayed.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.900
It doesn't matter if we have content or not.

07:41.900 --> 07:48.390
In a sidebar in-turn the 2016 thing does the same way I do.

07:48.400 --> 07:53.460
The only difference is that it uses the A-side stack inside the file too.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.210
Well these are possibilities.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.950
And you as the developer can choose the one you like the most.

08:00.950 --> 08:06.850
The important thing is to know how to get here exactly what I'm teaching you at the moment.

08:06.880 --> 08:11.650
So for now that's all I wait for you then in the next lesson by.
