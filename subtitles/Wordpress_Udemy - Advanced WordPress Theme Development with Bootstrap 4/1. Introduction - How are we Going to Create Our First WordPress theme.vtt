Welcome guys.

1
00:02.270 --> 00:04.430
This is our introduction lesson.

2
00:04.430 --> 00:08.860
My name is Marcelo and I will be your instructor here on this course.

3
00:08.920 --> 00:10.560
Well, just to begin this course, 

4
00:10.640 --> 00:13.060
Let me tell you a little about myself.

5
00:13.160 --> 00:17.150
I have a degree in system analysis and I work with web development

6
00:17.150 --> 00:24.850
since 2008. I started my career creating web sites but using only HTML and CSS.

7
00:25.120 --> 00:30.730
Later I learned how to use Joomla, which is another very good content management system.

8
00:30.830 --> 00:38.780
But since 2012 I've been creating themes using WordPress. As you know, Wordpress is a very powerful tool

9
00:39.080 --> 00:44.640
and when you master this tool, you can build just about any type of web site.

10
00:44.690 --> 00:49.280
I always say that the limitation is almost always your creativity.

11
00:49.670 --> 00:53.570
There are several ways to build a web site using WordPress.

12
00:53.570 --> 01:00.500
There are people who prefer to buy a premium theme, others use Page builders. In this course we won't

13
01:00.500 --> 01:08.030
use these tools. We will satisfy your curiosity and build build a WordPress theme from scratch from the ground

14
01:08.120 --> 01:08.920
up.

15
01:09.170 --> 01:15.260
In order for this to be possible we'll follow all the recommendations of the Wordpress team itself.

16
01:15.260 --> 01:21.150
I'll teach you how to create custom themes and you'll be able to understand all step by step.

17
01:21.200 --> 01:26.820
I want you to finish this course with a very broad view of how a theme works.

18
01:27.110 --> 01:33.350
By the way you'll notice that I'm always mentioning two words: website and theme.

19
01:33.360 --> 01:39.770
Over time you come to realize that although they seem the very same thing, a theme is something a bit

20
01:39.770 --> 01:41.170
more comprehensive.

21
01:41.220 --> 01:47.540
A theme is replicable and can even become a great source of income for anyone who knows how to build

22
01:47.540 --> 01:48.070
it.

23
01:48.200 --> 01:54.590
But this course will serve both, those who would like to create a simple website, but with a totally customized

24
01:54.590 --> 02:01.520
look, created in a very detailed way, as well as those who want to learn how to create themes for redistribution.

25
02:02.150 --> 02:03.110
In this course

26
02:03.110 --> 02:06.210
we will learn the basics of building a WordPress theme.

27
02:06.330 --> 02:12.260
Later, you can decide whether you want your focus on creating custom sites or you want to go a little

28
02:12.260 --> 02:17.990
further by creating themes that can be sold in marketplaces like Theme Forest, for example.

29
02:17.990 --> 02:24.200
Whatever your decision is, the important thing is that you have a solid foundation and this is what this course

30
02:24.200 --> 02:25.550
wants to offer you.

31
02:26.640 --> 02:32.220
Actually this course is an English version of one of my courses in Brazilian Portuguese that is already

32
02:32.220 --> 02:35.130
very successful here at Udemy.

33
02:35.350 --> 02:40.210
I would like you to finish this course with the same skills that my Brazilian students have been able to

34
02:40.210 --> 02:42.280
develop.

35
02:42.320 --> 02:45.190
Now, who is this course aimed at?

36
02:45.430 --> 02:52.370
Well it's basically for people who already have a minimal idea of how to create a website. That is, you

37
02:52.370 --> 02:58.310
have to necessarily know at least a little HTML, CSS and a bit of PHP as well.

38
02:58.520 --> 03:03.120
This course is essentially focused on teaching how WordPress works.

39
03:03.350 --> 03:09.970
So, even if I wanted to, I would not have time to teach you some notions of HTML, CSS and PHP

40
03:09.980 --> 03:16.600
here. That is, you must have at least a little experience with web development, right?

41
03:16.750 --> 03:23.920
Since this course is not about HTML and CSS, I must make a couple of things clear from the beginning.

42
03:23.960 --> 03:30.350
The fact is that many of these CSS and HTML changes we will make within our theme will not be explained

43
03:30.350 --> 03:31.520
in detail.

44
03:31.610 --> 03:35.460
Of course I will show you where these modifications have been applied.

45
03:35.480 --> 03:37.900
Explain why they have been applied.

46
03:38.000 --> 03:41.800
But I wonâ€™t explain HTML and CSS in detail, right?

47
03:41.810 --> 03:47.060
For example, I will not show you how I make to change the color of an HTML div tag.

48
03:47.360 --> 03:53.480
The real focus will be on showing the theme structure, the WordPress functions used to build them, 

49
03:53.480 --> 03:55.700
the Wordpress way of doing things.

50
03:55.880 --> 04:01.550
But all of the changes I make will be available to you in the files you have for download in the next

51
04:01.550 --> 04:02.340
lecture.

52
04:02.390 --> 04:07.290
You'll find the links to access all of the files that will be created during the course.

53
04:07.290 --> 04:10.030
They will be your guide during the course OK.

54
04:11.100 --> 04:13.820
Well the basis of the course will be the layout

55
04:13.830 --> 04:17.470
I'm showing you right now. It's a very simple layout.

56
04:17.520 --> 04:24.000
It's absolutely not the most beautiful layout in the world but it will help us understand the basics

57
04:24.000 --> 04:25.450
of a WordPress theme.

58
04:25.770 --> 04:30.940
But then you may ask me: why don't you teach us how do you create a one page theme?

59
04:31.020 --> 04:34.870
They are so much trendy and cool.

60
04:35.010 --> 04:37.910
Why is it done this way and not that way?

61
04:38.100 --> 04:45.120
Simply because I believe this kind of layout here makes it possible to use most WordPress tools. I believe

62
04:45.150 --> 04:51.690
it's the most complete layput for what I want to teach you. We will learn how to put these elements on

63
04:51.690 --> 04:56.110
the page and how and where to use plugins.

64
04:56.300 --> 05:03.320
In this course you will delve into more complex concepts like the Theme Customizer and you'll learn

65
05:03.320 --> 05:06.210
how to build custom fields for your clients.

66
05:08.810 --> 05:11.360
You'll learn about theme internationalization

67
05:14.230 --> 05:16.390
and also plugin packaging.

68
05:16.390 --> 05:22.180
I mean, you'll learn how to include all the plugins used on your theme and make them available when a

69
05:22.180 --> 05:28.780
user activates your theme. Topics you cannot find in all courses on WordPress theme creation.

70
05:28.780 --> 05:31.600
And I'll also be here to make your learning easier,

71
05:31.630 --> 05:38.650
of course. At the end of the course you'll learn how to create a custom theme like a pro, and you'll make

72
05:38.650 --> 05:41.500
yourself happy for taking that step.

73
05:41.650 --> 05:45.030
I hope you like the course and see you in the next lesson.
