Either you're almost coming to the end of this course and you're ready to go on with another lesson.

00:09.310 --> 00:16.240
Remember that at the end of the installation section we had an unanswered question I asked you the following

00:16.240 --> 00:17.030
question.

00:17.090 --> 00:19.560
Let's suppose I want to distribute my thing.

00:19.660 --> 00:20.420
How can I do.

00:20.470 --> 00:24.280
Also make plugins available to download along with my theme.

00:24.340 --> 00:27.920
Is there a way to bandeau the necessary plugins along with the thing.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.770
I think for a moment when I create a WordPress team I can easily make all the files available.

00:35.960 --> 00:40.420
I just need to compress all the files that are inside the Sims folder.

00:40.460 --> 00:47.470
Basically it is what the authors do to make their things available in word Bradstock orgy or in-thing

00:47.540 --> 00:49.030
forest for example.

00:49.370 --> 00:51.190
But what about the plugins.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.970
We have two problems with them.

00:53.270 --> 01:00.520
First most of the time they are third party creations so your users would need to download each plugin

01:00.560 --> 01:02.240
if they want to use them.

01:02.240 --> 01:07.540
The second issue is that all the information in this plugins is not stored in files.

01:07.700 --> 01:13.510
For example you can not make the plugin data available through this theme's folder here.

01:13.520 --> 01:18.990
This data is stored in the database so we are in dire straits.

01:19.310 --> 01:25.640
The theme we created needs certain plugins to work but we are unable to deliver this blowguns along

01:25.640 --> 01:26.660
with the theme.

01:26.990 --> 01:29.420
So I can indeed fix that.

01:29.810 --> 01:36.890
Fortunately there is a very interesting library used extensively by developers that can help us solve

01:36.920 --> 01:38.150
this dilemma.

01:38.150 --> 01:41.240
Its name is TGM plugin activation.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.850
I am going to teach you how to use its basic features from now on K.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.020
To start off as head over to the library website

01:52.840 --> 02:00.220
and here on the site let's click on the download link and the first question you have to answer is where

02:00.220 --> 02:03.590
you use the TGM plugin activation.

02:03.590 --> 02:11.530
Let's say here we used to use it in the theme as say that we distribute the theme in Wordpress or e.g.

02:12.330 --> 02:15.760
And next that seem form the text domain of our theme.

02:15.910 --> 02:21.010
The text domain has been defined in our lessons about things internationalization.

02:21.180 --> 02:24.730
In our case it's called Learn W.P..

02:25.350 --> 02:30.520
OK with all the required fields that we're going to generate the library files.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.860
Let's save it here onto the computer.

02:42.070 --> 02:49.030
And when we open the folder we have a bunch of files but in fact we basically need two of these files

02:49.030 --> 02:49.840
here.

02:49.990 --> 02:57.430
One of them is declasse TGM plugin activation that peach peafowl and the other is this simple file here

02:57.700 --> 03:01.130
that will be renamed later first thing.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.220
Let's copy these two files.

03:06.180 --> 03:09.640
And paste them inside our theme's ink folder.

03:12.930 --> 03:19.920
It doesn't have to be exactly in this folder OK but I'm going to put the two files here just for organization

03:19.920 --> 03:21.160
purposes.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.510
And now I'm going to rename this file name.

03:23.520 --> 03:33.290
Example that page Picchu required plugins that BHB later on you'll understand why I'm doing this.

03:34.390 --> 03:39.790
Now inside the sample file I see what the get are.

03:39.790 --> 03:47.350
The first thing we notice is that it's a very big file that a lot of code and a lot of it is commented

03:47.350 --> 03:47.900
out.

03:48.070 --> 03:53.850
But don't be intimidated by this because it's very simple to deal with this file.

03:53.920 --> 03:59.700
The first practical thing we're going to do is find a way to include this class file in our thing.

03:59.710 --> 04:05.050
In fact this is the true working mechanism of this TGM library.

04:05.170 --> 04:10.440
Above you can see that this is the first instruction that we have to follow.

04:10.630 --> 04:15.620
We must use or require one speech comment to include this class file.

04:15.670 --> 04:22.060
Here we have an example of how to do this using a parent thing which is our case our child theme which

04:22.060 --> 04:24.180
is not our case at the moment.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.770
So let's do this let's comment out this line down here.

04:29.760 --> 04:36.460
And we're going to copy the required one example to our parents from and we're going to paste this line

04:36.580 --> 04:38.800
in our functions file.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.190
It's always the functions file.

04:41.620 --> 04:46.890
So let's open this file and I spaced the line we have just copied here.

04:53.740 --> 04:57.870
We just have to change the path in order to match the actual file.

04:57.880 --> 05:02.250
Let's delete this content here and type in ink instead.

05:04.020 --> 05:06.020
Now let's copy this line here.

05:08.480 --> 05:16.180
And also call the example file that we are going to required plug that page be.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.810
So we need to require these two files here.

05:21.180 --> 05:25.330
If you want it could copy this function here to your functions file instead.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.080
But I prefer to require this whole file.

05:28.080 --> 05:33.850
I think it's easier by doing this when WordPress loads the function file.

05:33.950 --> 05:42.010
It will also automatically called TGM library main class file Well this lessons will be divided into

05:42.010 --> 05:42.650
three.

05:42.670 --> 05:46.490
OK I think this way it will be easier to understand.

05:46.540 --> 05:51.930
So that's all we have for today's lesson and I'll wait for you then in the next one.

05:52.060 --> 05:52.480
Thea.
