00:00.660 --> 00:07.950
Hello again so continuing where we left off in this lesson you're going to learn how to create template

00:07.950 --> 00:08.490
pages.

00:08.520 --> 00:15.280
But in a different way you're going to adapt the strategy for both the contact and the About Us pages.

00:15.420 --> 00:16.280
Are you ready.

00:16.470 --> 00:17.820
So let's go.

00:18.270 --> 00:25.200
Let's start by removing this file here page about is that page piece inserts will not be used for us

00:25.290 --> 00:26.550
any longer.

00:26.600 --> 00:33.500
Now let's create another file with a very different structure still within our themes folder.

00:33.570 --> 00:42.060
We're going to save this file and its name is going to be general hyphen template that BHB Let's use

00:42.060 --> 00:48.960
a comment structure that would present other medically identifies as a template page as the name implies.

00:49.110 --> 00:52.180
This file will serve as a template.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.970
The advantage of this template is that it can be used as Vusi.

00:57.310 --> 01:02.140
I start by opening the page with tags inside them.

01:02.220 --> 01:03.630
You want to create a comment

01:06.810 --> 01:14.220
by typing here template name let's call it general template.

01:14.430 --> 01:17.910
That is it will serve any kind of pages I want.

01:18.210 --> 01:22.160
But if you want to give another name to your template go ahead and do that.

01:22.530 --> 01:27.330
Well how will this structure out this general template look like.

01:27.330 --> 01:35.730
Again let's grab a copy of our index that beach B file and space the content with just copy it into

01:35.730 --> 01:37.540
the new template file.

01:38.040 --> 01:38.510
OK.

01:38.550 --> 01:42.090
We can now start excluding the sections and div tags.

01:42.090 --> 01:43.720
We don't want interesting plate

01:49.780 --> 01:56.350
we can't even exclude the bootstrap row since we will have only a single column that will spend the

01:56.350 --> 01:58.250
entire width of the page.

01:58.480 --> 02:05.030
So we don't need column classes aswell.

02:05.090 --> 02:09.180
For now let's add the paragraphs below this article tag.

02:09.620 --> 02:18.200
Now let's go back to the ad men and added some pages for example going to add the About Us page and

02:18.200 --> 02:21.730
here you'll notice something we didn't have before.

02:22.040 --> 02:29.380
On the right side here in the page attributes a few It's called the template appears and as a template

02:29.390 --> 02:37.200
page we have the default template option which is now selected just the branches in this explanation.

02:37.220 --> 02:40.310
What is this default template.

02:40.340 --> 02:48.720
You may ask every time we hear this name defrauds template you have to think of the index dot page profile.

02:48.740 --> 02:53.870
This file is always considered by WordPress as the default state.

02:54.170 --> 03:00.400
Hence its importance whenever WordPress doesn't know how to display content in the front end.

03:00.590 --> 03:06.260
If you use the default thing play that is the index dot pitch B file.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.000
It's a fallback file.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.670
Very important to WordPress seems OK.

03:11.790 --> 03:18.450
Now closing other princes and coming back we can say that this space is going to use a different thing

03:18.480 --> 03:21.950
with page not the default one based on the index.

03:21.950 --> 03:23.500
That page be filed.

03:23.670 --> 03:30.730
If I click here we see that we now have the template we created called general template.

03:30.750 --> 03:42.350
Let's do this and update this page now on the front end below that you see that the page structure is

03:42.350 --> 03:47.380
shown according to the content we have in the general template that is peafowl.

03:47.390 --> 03:49.580
Notice the paragraph you created for reference.

03:49.580 --> 03:51.230
For example.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.120
So let's say the same thing for the contact page.

03:55.190 --> 03:56.480
Let's go back to the dashboard

03:59.570 --> 04:02.390
added the page and inside it.

04:02.600 --> 04:09.720
Let's use again the 10 page page recreated this is the greatest advantage of this strategy.

04:10.060 --> 04:17.500
I just created one file that serves as a template and this template can be used on whatever pages I

04:17.500 --> 04:19.500
want whenever I want.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.070
And of course I can create as many template pages I want.

04:24.070 --> 04:27.100
In fact I want to show you something curious.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.270
Most of the things we download from the Wordpress repository have several templates.

04:31.270 --> 04:37.900
For example you can choose between a template page without the sidebar and other template with a sidebar.

04:38.140 --> 04:40.720
Another one with three columns etc..

04:41.020 --> 04:43.780
This can vary from thing to thing.

04:43.810 --> 04:49.690
Also most of the things that call themselves multi-purpose themes adopt this strategy.

04:49.870 --> 04:51.790
For example this thing here

04:54.710 --> 05:00.880
it's multi-purpose because it allows the site owner to choose between different home page templates.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.820
For example this home page here that we're seeing now

05:09.180 --> 05:13.040
looks different from this shop home page template.

05:13.320 --> 05:20.290
But in fact the inner pages for example the 4 for error page it's always the same.

05:20.520 --> 05:26.460
We can achieve this by creating different template page files to be used on a static home page.

05:26.700 --> 05:35.190
But let's go back to our theme so let's go ahead and update this page here and see how it's shown in

05:35.190 --> 05:35.970
the front end.

05:38.730 --> 05:44.820
Look at is the contact page now has a template which is identical to the About Us page.

05:44.820 --> 05:48.340
That's because they use the same page template code.

05:48.390 --> 05:57.060
The general template as I told you earlier only the structure is the same the content itself is not.

05:57.090 --> 06:03.240
For example each one has a different page title but they are both in the same space.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.530
Same for color font size etc..

06:06.710 --> 06:10.400
Your other pages however follow another logic.

06:11.040 --> 06:16.360
Now that we have our template page up and running lets make it look a little better.

06:17.900 --> 06:25.940
From this loop we'll be removing the publication date the author the categories and tags Sing's pages

06:26.000 --> 06:28.500
don't have these items.

06:28.580 --> 06:34.320
Let's save this file.

06:34.510 --> 06:37.760
So let's add some dummy content inside this pages.

06:46.730 --> 06:47.850
An update again.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.750
OK that's it now.

06:51.780 --> 06:57.910
And the content we add on this page is we will have a similarly odd since they follow the same thing

06:57.920 --> 07:01.050
bleet.

07:01.300 --> 07:05.620
And now finally all of our pages look different.

07:05.650 --> 07:14.110
We have the About Us page and the contact page that follow a template page structure the blog page that

07:14.110 --> 07:22.060
has the post list and follows the default template that is the index dot page be file and the home page

07:22.270 --> 07:30.260
which follows the contents of a file called Page hyphen home that be Marcello.

07:30.340 --> 07:36.830
Could I turn the page home page file into a template file as well yes for sure.

07:36.850 --> 07:39.850
In fact many things do this.

07:39.850 --> 07:40.720
It depends on you.

07:40.720 --> 07:46.340
I can now at least you know how to use all these tools available.

07:46.570 --> 07:52.740
Choose the one you like the best or the one that makes the most sense for your thing and apply it.

07:52.960 --> 07:58.010
In fact you can go ahead and turn your page home that page file into a template file.

07:58.330 --> 08:03.980
But just for the sake as an exercise since will still need that file in the next lesson.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.980
You'll come back talking about another subject.

08:07.090 --> 08:10.410
We're going to learn what a theme support is.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.670
And then happy calling.
