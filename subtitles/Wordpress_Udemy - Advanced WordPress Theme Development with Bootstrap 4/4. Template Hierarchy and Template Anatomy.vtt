00:00.420 --> 00:01.410
Hello everyone.

00:01.410 --> 00:03.590
Welcome to another lesson.

00:03.990 --> 00:08.760
So in this lesson we're going to talk about the anatomy of a WordPress theme.

00:08.950 --> 00:12.510
We all understand how a WordPress theme is made up.

00:12.630 --> 00:17.790
What files directories and what are the rules that you have to follow.

00:18.210 --> 00:24.930
Despite the fact that this lesson has a lot of theory I highly recommend that you follow it until the

00:24.930 --> 00:25.460
end of the day.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.190
It's very important.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.410
But before you continue on you must already have WordPress installed.

00:31.410 --> 00:36.260
If you're not ready yet please take a look at the previous lesson OK.

00:36.810 --> 00:41.650
But of course I will be using Sublime Text 3 as my primary ID.

00:41.670 --> 00:44.600
My integrated development environment.

00:44.850 --> 00:48.330
But of course you can use whatever ID you prefer.

00:48.380 --> 00:55.200
The one which you feel most at ease to begin this lesson will be showing you how the directory structure

00:55.440 --> 00:57.780
of the word breastfeeds looks like.

00:57.780 --> 01:02.740
You remember that we installed WordPress in a folder called W.P..

01:03.030 --> 01:09.660
So if you follow that structure we have three folders at the root of the installation.

01:09.660 --> 01:10.510
This one here.

01:10.660 --> 01:18.520
WPA admin W.P. content and WP includes.

01:18.590 --> 01:23.590
We also have several other files that are also part of the Wordpress environment.

01:23.870 --> 01:28.840
But forget about it now because we were talking about them later on this course.

01:28.850 --> 01:32.630
So where are all of the Wordpress themes.

01:32.870 --> 01:39.530
Well themes can be found inside the WP content folder and if you open that folder there is another one

01:39.530 --> 01:42.820
called themes inside the content.

01:42.830 --> 01:47.790
We also have the plugins folder and other important WordPress folders.

01:47.990 --> 01:50.930
Well lets stick with the themes for the for now.

01:51.380 --> 01:58.310
If you open this folder will see that WordPress already comes with at least 3 themes installed and they

01:58.310 --> 02:06.440
are always related to you in which they were produced and the last one here will be the 20:17 theme

02:06.770 --> 02:10.420
because I am creating discourse in 2017.

02:10.760 --> 02:17.060
Well go ahead and open up this folder inside look there is a new folder structure.

02:17.150 --> 02:23.780
We have a folder for the CSA files and this one here can be used for including our personal functions.

02:23.780 --> 02:31.160
If you want to do that a folder for files in javascript format and other files here as well and I think

02:31.160 --> 02:33.060
you may be wondering.

02:33.260 --> 02:39.540
But Marcello there are so many files and so many folders.

02:39.610 --> 02:45.930
Why did you create all of these files and all of these folders if I want a custom WordPress Fien.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.170
Well not exactly.

02:48.170 --> 02:57.170
In fact in theory it WordPress film that really works only need two files the not BHB and the style

02:57.170 --> 02:59.910
that CSSA file would come down.

02:59.950 --> 03:05.770
We are better understand how these files work during our course are just starting.

03:05.930 --> 03:14.110
But just to be clear since the beginning index that BHB is the entry point of our theme and style that

03:14.150 --> 03:18.880
VSS is responsible for telling WordPress what is the name of the thing.

03:19.040 --> 03:26.890
The author of the Thien the description of the theme but will see all that in the next lessons OK.

03:27.140 --> 03:34.800
Of course if you view the theme with just these two files it would be too humble and we don't want that.

03:35.030 --> 03:41.180
Let's imagine that you want the content of a contact page which shows up when you click on the menu

03:41.180 --> 03:42.890
link corresponding to it.

03:42.890 --> 03:47.450
We want that page to be different from the content of your home page.

03:47.450 --> 03:54.710
For example if your film has only thing next batch file your contact page will be identical to the home

03:54.710 --> 03:55.580
page.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.640
Surely that's not what we want is it.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.880
Of course not.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.860
That's why we have these other files here.

04:02.990 --> 04:07.040
Each one of them we are specialized in a part of the wordpress site.

04:07.100 --> 04:14.020
For example the single dot BHP file will help us create a single view of a single post.

04:14.150 --> 04:21.830
On the other hand the page speech file is used to open a static page which is different from a post

04:22.160 --> 04:29.370
which WordPress understands as having say a more dynamic content than a static page.

04:29.750 --> 04:35.440
And there are yet several other files that will get to know during the course.

04:35.430 --> 04:40.170
Another important file is the one called screenshot that P and G.

04:40.190 --> 04:44.960
This file is just a cropped image of everything that represents the theme.

04:45.050 --> 04:53.390
When we are within the admin area so hearing the admin area if I head over to appearance and click on

04:53.390 --> 05:01.700
themes we see that for everything there is an image and those images come from a file called screenshot

05:01.760 --> 05:05.310
that DNG OK.

05:05.400 --> 05:13.110
One interesting thing that you notice is that film files such as index starts page B already serve as

05:13.110 --> 05:19.920
study material to us you can better understand how a film works if you just open them up and begin reading

05:19.920 --> 05:21.060
their documentation.

05:21.060 --> 05:30.300
For example here we have the index database file which is part of the 20:17 seen in this file itself.

05:30.300 --> 05:34.300
You already have a description of what it is as you see here.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.370
It says that it is the main thing file.

05:37.410 --> 05:42.300
The main thing file is the entry point of a WordPress site.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.840
It is one of the files required for you to be the theme.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.020
The other one being the style that says as I explained to you previously.

05:51.590 --> 05:56.790
For each of the native word breastfeeds files you have this kind of documentation.

05:56.790 --> 06:03.330
In fact it's a good practice if you start creating your files this way offering all of the documentation

06:03.330 --> 06:05.320
of your scene as you created.

06:05.400 --> 06:12.240
However we will not do that because time is a little short for this course as we're having to use another

06:12.240 --> 06:13.140
file.

06:13.140 --> 06:20.430
For example page Dutch BHB the documentation here says that it is the template for displaying pages

06:20.490 --> 06:28.890
with static content and the single that speech is I think it's used to show all the single posts and

06:28.950 --> 06:32.020
also attachments of our site.

06:32.630 --> 06:40.380
Well what happens when you visit for example a post or a static WordPress page but a way if you don't

06:40.380 --> 06:42.720
know what is a static page.

06:42.900 --> 06:49.680
A good example of what this page looks like would be the default example page of the Wordpress installation

06:49.980 --> 06:54.560
just go ahead and open it and you'll see what I mean.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.750
What happens when we visit one of these contents.

06:57.900 --> 07:03.500
Is that a mechanism that we're frescos this thing hierarchy comes into action.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.560
So explain how this works.

07:05.600 --> 07:11.520
Am going to use this image here that was created by the WB turd's Plus website.

07:11.580 --> 07:16.350
It explains very well in my view how this mechanism works.

07:16.350 --> 07:24.720
In addition it also explains to us how the anatomy of a WordPress theme is this is say an anatomical

07:24.720 --> 07:31.860
model of Wordpress Feme look in this anatomical model and also hierarchical.

07:31.950 --> 07:36.050
The main part will always be adding the X that page file.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.900
As I explained earlier it is the main thing file.

07:39.940 --> 07:46.230
It will always be used to show the content of a page in situations where we don't need any specific

07:46.230 --> 07:54.570
template or when WordPress doesn't know which page templates use this file is what we call a fallback.

07:54.660 --> 08:02.370
Now if at some point we need to present a page with a specific look to the site visitor we will no longer

08:02.370 --> 08:09.450
use the index that speech template at that point we are going to go down a bit in the hierarchy and

08:09.450 --> 08:13.510
use another page template which is inside another file.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.880
Give given example.

08:15.030 --> 08:22.230
And that's one thing that happens all the time within WordPress say a visitor enters your site through

08:22.230 --> 08:24.300
a poorly formatted link.

08:24.300 --> 08:30.840
In these situations most sites show a page known as a full or full page to the visitor which is a classic

08:30.900 --> 08:32.130
error page.

08:32.130 --> 08:38.190
If your film has a file called Full of all that BHB you can create a totally different look for that

08:38.190 --> 08:38.790
file.

08:38.970 --> 08:45.930
But if your film doesn't have a file called for or for that page be well pressed to obey the things

08:45.930 --> 08:52.650
hierarchy and show the contents of the index that page files that I mean WordPress you'll be using the

08:52.650 --> 08:57.300
fallback file instead of a full of four page file.

08:57.330 --> 09:04.500
You can apply the same reasoning model to other files for example the single file is the file for viewing

09:04.500 --> 09:05.720
Singo posts.

09:05.850 --> 09:13.230
If a team has this file and I always recommend that you have one every time you click a link in a post

09:13.470 --> 09:19.860
you view the page according to the design of the single that page be filed following all the HMO tags

09:19.950 --> 09:22.640
and Page functions inside that file.

09:22.680 --> 09:28.890
Considering this image as the anatomical template of the word WordPress thing you could say that these

09:28.890 --> 09:34.310
files about which I just spoke here in the central part of the page.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.140
OK.

09:35.430 --> 09:39.380
They will be part of what they call the Word Press.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.920
And this same plate has its own loop inside it.

09:43.080 --> 09:50.160
But we'll be explaining it better in other classes in addition to the loop region which is here in the

09:50.160 --> 09:52.170
middle of the bage for this drawing.

09:52.320 --> 09:56.730
But you can move it any other area of the site according to your design.

09:56.910 --> 10:02.960
We have choose structures that repeat on all pages and are generated by two files.

10:03.060 --> 10:10.500
Up here the content that comes from the header that page file and here below the content of the footer

10:10.500 --> 10:16.840
that page file option only our site can also have what is called a sidebar.

10:17.070 --> 10:20.010
And that's what makes the word breastfeed beautiful.

10:20.070 --> 10:23.750
It can be very dynamic with all these possibilities.

10:23.890 --> 10:24.380
There is.

10:24.420 --> 10:31.740
You can even create a theme using just the next dot page profile but WordPress gives you all the tools

10:31.740 --> 10:35.150
to make this theme much richer much better.

10:36.240 --> 10:41.520
We can see all of this in the theme lay out that we will be viewing in the scores here from the top

10:41.970 --> 10:46.890
where we see this little red bar up to the menu area.

10:46.920 --> 10:53.110
We have our head or the contents of this entire area it's come in from the header data file.

10:53.190 --> 10:59.850
The dynamic part in which we will have the template files and then loops will extend from this slide

10:59.850 --> 11:05.480
here to the map.

11:05.600 --> 11:12.950
So we're going to include all of the dynamic content of the website the content that is not static in

11:12.950 --> 11:14.640
that big area here.

11:14.780 --> 11:20.870
And to complete the design we'll have our footer at the end whose content will come from a template

11:20.870 --> 11:25.060
part called footer that PH BE also for some pages.

11:25.070 --> 11:28.300
We have a sidebar in our case for the home page.

11:28.310 --> 11:35.100
The sidebar will be positioned on the left side but not now you'll see all of that in our next lesson.

11:35.100 --> 11:35.750
OK.

11:36.080 --> 11:41.430
I promise you that in the next lesson we will stop fury and we will begin practicing a lot.

11:41.430 --> 11:42.090
OK.

11:42.350 --> 11:46.090
Until then and now we'll catch you guys on my next video.
