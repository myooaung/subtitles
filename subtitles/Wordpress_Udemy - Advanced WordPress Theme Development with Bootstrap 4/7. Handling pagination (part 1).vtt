Hello guys as I told you in the last lesson now is time to learn how pagination works on the word breastfeed.

00:08.810 --> 00:14.870
Well let's start by looking at the posts we have in the Word Press and mean right now let's head over

00:14.870 --> 00:17.370
to posts and click here.

00:19.510 --> 00:22.300
Now I would just open this page because I want you to see that.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.910
Currently we have 11 posts here.

00:25.980 --> 00:31.740
If you don't have 11 posts in your Wordpress installation just go ahead and create more posts so you

00:31.740 --> 00:33.200
can follow the explanations.

00:33.210 --> 00:36.490
OK well now that you know that.

00:36.650 --> 00:43.280
Let's go over to the front in let's go ahead and visit the blog page and let's see if we have all of

00:43.280 --> 00:44.980
those 11 posts here.

00:45.720 --> 00:51.280
So one two three four.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.750
Ten.

00:54.890 --> 00:56.300
Look how strange.

00:56.330 --> 00:59.030
Only 10 posts are displayed on this page.

00:59.030 --> 01:02.230
If my math is correct one post is missing.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.170
So why is this post.

01:05.420 --> 01:06.860
Let's do another test.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.520
Let's do a fairly generic search.

01:09.790 --> 01:13.550
Let's search for all the posts that contains the letter A.

01:13.760 --> 01:18.970
You agree with me that most if not all posts should contain the letter A.

01:18.980 --> 01:23.990
Right so we should have at least 11 results on the search page.

01:23.990 --> 01:31.290
If you take into account that pages are post-ops within WordPress we can have at you more than 11 results.

01:31.670 --> 01:35.650
Well let's check that out and see how many results we have.

01:36.990 --> 01:43.230
So one two three.

01:43.460 --> 01:46.270
But again we have only 10 posts.

01:46.530 --> 01:47.320
But why.

01:47.690 --> 01:51.290
Well the answer as ever is quite simple.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.830
This balls are actually hitting in order for them to be displayed.

01:55.850 --> 02:02.570
We need to enable pagination both in our indexed page profile for the blog page and other pages that

02:02.570 --> 02:09.350
may use the default template as well as the search that page file for the search results.

02:09.500 --> 02:14.580
Pagination allows us to navigate the other pages that at the moment are hidden.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.980
But first I have to answer a question.

02:17.300 --> 02:21.520
Why do we always have 10 posts on those pages.

02:21.630 --> 02:26.510
So let's go back to the dashboard score settings.

02:26.790 --> 02:37.840
Reading and here is an option that says blog pages show at most issue has the value of 10 so that's

02:37.840 --> 02:38.810
the answer.

02:39.190 --> 02:42.370
Let's change this value to 5 and see what happens.

02:45.780 --> 02:52.480
Relo the search page.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.870
Now we only have five folks shown here

02:57.760 --> 02:59.110
and here and the blog page.

02:59.110 --> 03:02.020
We also have five posts.

03:02.110 --> 03:11.080
If there were pagination as we have 11 posts we should have 3 pages two pages with five posts each and

03:11.080 --> 03:13.910
one last page with only one force right.

03:15.100 --> 03:19.670
OK we can have at least two types of pagination in wordpress.

03:19.690 --> 03:23.840
Again first of all implement pagination with links.

03:23.840 --> 03:30.800
This is the most common type of pagination and we can find it on many websites out there and we also

03:30.800 --> 03:36.230
have a numeric pagination also quite common and quite intuitive.

03:36.620 --> 03:42.810
I'm going to teach you how to create both types of pagination firstly for the blog page.

03:42.820 --> 03:48.940
Are you're going to create a pagination with previews and next links for this.

03:48.940 --> 03:54.470
We're going to open our index file and we have to modify this look here.

03:55.270 --> 04:03.790
As you know the book goes from here from the Y to the end while you're going to recreate the pagination

04:03.790 --> 04:07.030
links soon after the loop is complete.

04:07.030 --> 04:10.500
That is since we have five balls for each page.

04:10.540 --> 04:19.000
Our pagination will only appear after the loop brings this five posts so here after the end while we're

04:19.000 --> 04:24.020
going to close the page we tag open it again.

04:25.440 --> 04:32.410
And here in this space we're going to create the necessary AGM markup for the pagination things.

04:32.490 --> 04:35.910
First we need a bootstrap rule.

04:36.140 --> 04:43.700
And now let's create two effects each that the pages class which are then how post-Iowa pagination later

04:44.480 --> 04:47.660
and bootstrap classes to have position each link.

04:48.880 --> 04:54.400
The first navigation link will be positioned to the left and the second to the right.

04:54.790 --> 04:58.060
So let's use the text left and text right.

04:58.060 --> 05:05.950
Bootstrap classis this column classes will guarantee that both links will have the same size each occupying

05:06.010 --> 05:13.130
half of the screen.

05:13.190 --> 05:20.390
Now in order for the pagination to work let's replace this text we choose WordPress functions first

05:20.660 --> 05:24.080
including the two functions and then I'll explain them to you.

05:26.580 --> 05:29.380
OK you must be thinking that I did something wrong.

05:29.640 --> 05:36.720
How come the link pointing to a new post uses the function called previous post link and the link pointing

05:36.720 --> 05:38.400
to the other post uses.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.290
Next post link.

05:40.290 --> 05:43.650
This should be very wrong but it's not.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.050
It takes a while to get used to the idea.

05:46.050 --> 05:46.860
I know.

05:47.130 --> 05:51.930
In fact all of this will make more sense when you see the result.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.810
So let's save and switch to the front end.

05:58.580 --> 06:05.800
Here on the first page we have the link to the older posts it's being generated to the next post.

06:05.800 --> 06:13.100
Link function that makes sense because the next post on our list are actually the ones with the earliest

06:13.100 --> 06:15.020
publication date.

06:15.020 --> 06:26.530
Following this logic if you go to the last page you see there the oh this post of all and really if

06:26.530 --> 06:31.670
you go back to the dashboard you see that this post here is the oldest one.

06:32.740 --> 06:39.190
Instead the link that points to the newer post uses the previous post link function.

06:39.190 --> 06:44.080
That's because the previous posts are the newest posts.

06:44.080 --> 06:44.840
Did you get it.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.610
Well that's what we have for today.

06:48.820 --> 06:51.780
I hope you like it and that it made sense to you.

06:51.790 --> 06:57.850
I know it's kind of weird at the beginning but when you start creating your own things you understand

06:57.850 --> 07:04.780
the logic and how things works in the next lesson you'll come back and read and implement another type

07:04.780 --> 07:09.640
of pagination for the search page and should then be calling.
