Hey what's up guys in the last lesson we learn how to register our menus using the functions that should

00:07.160 --> 00:09.630
be file in today's lesson.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.530
You're going to continue this process.

00:11.540 --> 00:14.710
They knew how to position the menu in the film.

00:14.720 --> 00:15.870
So here we go.

00:17.380 --> 00:23.380
Let's open up our herder's page file which is where we decided that our menu is stay.

00:23.700 --> 00:29.080
It's going to stay right here in place of the word menu before doing this.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.060
Let's take a bit.

00:30.220 --> 00:37.360
Our harridans beach file using the bootstrap glasses since we already know how to do that right here

00:37.360 --> 00:40.000
inside the menu area section.

00:40.030 --> 00:42.070
Let's create a new container.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.460
Inside it.

00:45.490 --> 00:48.380
We want to create a new Dith declasse roll

00:53.700 --> 00:59.020
and before this roll we're going to create a div with the class line.

00:59.340 --> 01:03.220
Later in the course you will understand what this class is for.

01:03.750 --> 01:08.770
And now for the logo section let's add the following classes for the columns.

01:09.770 --> 01:10.420
Co.

01:10.520 --> 01:21.690
And the two co S M 12 Kole twelth.

01:21.730 --> 01:29.370
Let's also add the text center class so that the logo is entered in small and next more devices.

01:29.380 --> 01:35.810
This last class will make sense at the end of the course when we add our logo for the main menu nav

01:35.840 --> 01:36.480
tag.

01:36.650 --> 01:45.700
You're going to add the following classes called M.D tan text right.

01:45.730 --> 01:50.260
Notice that you'll not be using the small and extra small sizes.

01:50.290 --> 01:56.410
Not even the extra large sizes the extra small columns are omitted because at the end of the Course

01:56.780 --> 01:59.500
you'll be installing a responsive menu.

01:59.500 --> 02:07.390
So once the regular menu disappear in smaller screen devices replaced by the responsive menu we don't

02:07.390 --> 02:12.910
need to add those glasses but you understand it better when they get there OK.

02:13.180 --> 02:18.720
Let's go ahead and say that and go back to the front end and check those changes.

02:21.180 --> 02:27.750
OK as you can see the elements are already position it according to what we defined as go back to the

02:27.750 --> 02:31.660
file now in place of the word menu.

02:31.860 --> 02:37.640
I'm going to call a WordPress function that will finally position the menu we created in the last lesson.

02:37.650 --> 02:48.570
This function is W.P. underscore Nev. underscore menu so the opening closed parenthesis and place a

02:48.570 --> 02:50.800
semicolon at the end.

02:50.820 --> 02:55.290
Now here inside princes we're going to add our menu position.

02:55.290 --> 02:58.400
Do you remember what the menu position is.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.620
Is that information we create in the functions file.

03:01.620 --> 03:05.220
When you register a menu it's slug.

03:05.570 --> 03:07.250
Let's add an array here.

03:08.670 --> 03:10.120
And in this array.

03:10.170 --> 03:12.690
Let's pass some arguments.

03:12.870 --> 03:20.070
The most important of these arguments is the one called thean underscore location.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.830
Pay close attention to this underscore again.

03:23.040 --> 03:30.000
My brazening students are very confused about this and until this day some of them type a hyphen sort

03:29.990 --> 03:33.810
of underscore and this can lead to unexpected results.

03:33.810 --> 03:41.010
So much out the thing on the score location is nothing more than the slug of our menu and go back to

03:41.010 --> 03:44.950
the functions file and copy the slug for the main menu

03:49.800 --> 03:56.730
this function accepts several other arguments for example you can find a class for the menu a container

03:56.970 --> 04:03.010
a value for before and after the menu the amount of levels that this menu will have.

04:03.240 --> 04:08.730
But you can see more details about the other arguments in the link that is provided in this lecture

04:08.850 --> 04:13.750
by clicking on the resources available both here on the top left.

04:13.890 --> 04:19.560
For example you can create a bootstrap menu by modifying arguments for this function.

04:19.570 --> 04:26.160
Unfortunately as this would take too long to be explained you're not going to address this topic in

04:26.160 --> 04:31.470
the course you'll be using a plugin to create a responsive menu that will be great.

04:31.500 --> 04:39.270
You promise but for a basic implementation of a menu in wordpress the thing location argument is enough.

04:39.270 --> 04:40.650
So I save this file.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.370
And let's look at how our site is getting.

04:44.370 --> 04:46.150
So keep your fingers crossed.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.940
Okay perfect.

04:47.940 --> 04:49.090
We have a menu.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.690
Finally re.

04:50.880 --> 04:54.840
It's still pretty simple but it's already working.

04:54.840 --> 05:01.110
Now remember that we said that the new static pages without a medic could be added to the menu.

05:01.290 --> 05:05.550
So let's see if this really works as go back to the dashboard.

05:10.150 --> 05:11.650
And let's create a new page

05:14.520 --> 05:15.190
as call.

05:15.340 --> 05:16.000
Testing

05:19.640 --> 05:28.590
and refresh the page OK look the new page has been magically added to the menu right.

05:28.780 --> 05:32.640
Well let's remove this page from the menu because we don't need it here.

05:35.520 --> 05:44.670
Click on this little arrow and it can choose to remove it save the options and we refresh the page once

05:44.670 --> 05:46.360
again.

05:46.540 --> 05:47.410
Very well.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.700
There is only one small detail missing.

05:50.800 --> 05:56.150
This menu is all vertical but we want the menu to be horizontal.

05:56.170 --> 05:57.270
How do you do that.

05:57.460 --> 06:02.980
Well the easiest way is to create a success row that can change the display of each list.

06:02.980 --> 06:07.370
Elements of this menu go over to the source file.

06:07.930 --> 06:11.830
Let's create a roo for our main menu element.

06:11.830 --> 06:19.480
This row will be applied to each element of the another list so name hyphen menu.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.870
Ul.

06:21.040 --> 06:25.920
I display inline.

06:25.960 --> 06:31.500
Of course there are other ways to do this but now let's just apply this rule.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.270
I saved the file and refresh our page

06:38.780 --> 06:43.100
and look now the menu is horizontal as I wanted.

06:43.170 --> 06:47.830
Since for using bootstraps text right class it's also right aligned.

06:48.080 --> 06:54.720
So Marcelo does that mean that if I click on one of these menu items I can already go to the desired

06:54.750 --> 06:55.950
page.

06:55.950 --> 06:57.320
Well let's go ahead and click

07:02.590 --> 07:07.930
it didn't open anything different and the page remains in the same place.

07:07.930 --> 07:10.750
The explanation for this is quite simple.

07:10.750 --> 07:14.390
For now the only thing we did was create a menu.

07:14.440 --> 07:20.740
We have not yet defined what will appear in this dynamic Harry or the site when they click on which

07:20.740 --> 07:22.010
menu item.

07:22.120 --> 07:28.120
This is what we are going to do in the next lessons so don't miss the next lessons as we are going to

07:28.120 --> 07:35.210
learn about one of the most essential concepts of average breastfeeds WordPress look so of it for you

07:35.210 --> 07:38.470
and the next lessons and then Happy coding.
