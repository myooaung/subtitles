Hey guys in this lesson we'll talk about the two basic files for creating a word breasting index that

00:07.260 --> 00:11.220
BGB and style that says in today's lesson.

00:11.220 --> 00:16.350
Finally you're going to start creating things in the next two lessons.

00:16.350 --> 00:20.040
You'll be able to create YOUR FIRST THING EVER.

00:20.040 --> 00:26.550
Just imagine that you will be able to access the Wordpress dashboard see your thing there and activate

00:26.550 --> 00:27.000
it.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.440
That sounds great doesn't it.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.010
So let's get started.

00:30.090 --> 00:34.550
The first thing you're going to do is create the folder structure of the thing.

00:34.680 --> 00:42.330
As you know my wordpress is installed in the WB folder and inside of folders we have WB content and

00:42.330 --> 00:47.190
then the things folder which is where all of the things must be created.

00:47.580 --> 00:53.730
So inside this folder I want to create a new one and I will name it.

00:53.730 --> 00:55.200
Learn W.P.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.780
inside this new folder.

00:59.890 --> 01:04.340
I want to create the two files that are very important to the theme.

01:04.390 --> 01:06.970
First we have index dot DHB

01:12.480 --> 01:21.070
and then style that CSSA.

01:21.190 --> 01:28.060
Another thing I already told you is that we have to identify this thing within the Wordpress admin area.

01:28.350 --> 01:38.610
So if we jump into the dashboard and head over to the opinions menu things you see all the things that

01:38.610 --> 01:41.780
we have already installed in wordpress.

01:42.420 --> 01:48.460
We have the Wordpress native themes here and also our learned WP.

01:48.840 --> 01:56.640
Notice that this new thing was included in the list based on the folder we just created but there is

01:56.640 --> 02:00.320
nothing that can be used to recognize this particular theme.

02:00.460 --> 02:06.780
Unlike the other things that are easily identifiable to solve this problem we have to create an image

02:06.780 --> 02:10.910
file and it must be called screenshot.

02:10.920 --> 02:11.760
OK.

02:12.290 --> 02:17.070
And the extension turn should be the entry to start with.

02:17.160 --> 02:23.760
I have already created screenshot that Binjie for you k which is the same file that I will make available

02:23.760 --> 02:26.490
for you to download with the course.

02:26.910 --> 02:34.260
But anyway its not that difficult to create that file with any image editing software or even a free

02:34.260 --> 02:34.780
one.

02:34.860 --> 02:41.190
You can easily create it but it should be asking yourself Is there any room to be followed if you want

02:41.190 --> 02:42.400
to create a file.

02:42.570 --> 02:47.410
Well first the file must have the DNG extension and Marcello.

02:47.610 --> 02:49.650
Can you use daypack instead.

02:49.920 --> 02:55.060
Yes you can but it's not recommended by WordPress itself.

02:55.110 --> 03:01.110
If you read their documentation you'll see that the guys only recommend a file with the DNJ extension

03:01.200 --> 03:02.750
so what can you do.

03:03.180 --> 03:07.880
And Marcello what can you say about the dimensions of that file.

03:08.310 --> 03:14.970
It's twelve hundred by 900 pixels despite the fact that the image was shown with that they mention in

03:14.970 --> 03:17.870
the admin area only in certain situations.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.590
So the recommendation is to have an image with trail hundred by nine hundred pixels OK.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.780
Plus go ahead and grab a file copier.

03:30.390 --> 03:32.850
And base it inside the Sims folder.

03:42.650 --> 03:51.020
Now if everything works out when we refresh the Wordpress admin you see the found no other thing represented

03:51.020 --> 03:53.080
by the screenshot that Binjie file

03:56.330 --> 03:58.880
get a grade it's working.

03:58.880 --> 04:05.960
Now when we click here to see more information about thing you see the image in a much larger size.

04:06.140 --> 04:11.420
But soon you realize that there is no additional information about this thing.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.910
We only have the folder name here.

04:13.970 --> 04:19.090
There is no version information nor do we have the author's name.

04:19.130 --> 04:26.420
So how do we make this information available in the same way we have for for example the native WordPress

04:26.420 --> 04:34.220
themes say if you choose one of the native themes we have several additional information about it.

04:34.490 --> 04:40.940
But it's the kind of magic that makes this happen well well snow magic and all this information will

04:40.940 --> 04:47.790
have to be created in our style that says file that simple for this to work you'll be simply using a

04:48.300 --> 04:56.100
common schema and those who already know the minimal about C Ss also know that the commenting success

04:56.120 --> 04:57.440
is reading like this.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.290
At the beginning.

04:58.310 --> 05:05.490
We have a forward slash and asterisk and at the end of the comment block again an asterisk and another

05:05.540 --> 05:06.680
for Slash.

05:06.680 --> 05:11.680
This is how we create a comment which has more than one line in a success file.

05:11.810 --> 05:18.870
Anything right here within the space will at first be ignored but not for press.

05:18.860 --> 05:25.280
WordPress will use this area to recognize many informations related to the theme such as the things

05:25.280 --> 05:29.980
name the things author description etc..

05:30.020 --> 05:35.170
The first thing you're going to type in here is the most basic information of all.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.380
What is our things name.

05:37.610 --> 05:39.320
So let's dive in here.

05:39.400 --> 05:47.810
Thing name and the name of our thing will be learned learn WP You can choose of course whatever name

05:47.810 --> 05:49.290
you want.

05:49.310 --> 05:50.690
You can also type in here.

05:50.690 --> 05:57.520
The things web page and this information will then appear as a link for us in the last word.

05:57.710 --> 06:01.210
So let's go ahead and type in thing you or I

06:06.660 --> 06:08.450
and what else.

06:08.540 --> 06:11.240
The author's name Arthur

06:17.350 --> 06:21.440
may also have a link to the author's page author.

06:21.490 --> 06:31.960
You are right and that may be the same information used for the theme you try and what else.

06:32.140 --> 06:35.110
The description for the theme description

06:40.800 --> 06:41.350
OK.

06:41.520 --> 06:47.300
Now I want to save this file and let's see what we have in the admin area.

06:49.240 --> 06:54.220
Again as we have already the thing's name here.

06:54.980 --> 06:59.210
Go ahead and click here to see more information about it.

06:59.410 --> 07:01.930
Look the name of the theme again.

07:02.090 --> 07:07.610
We don't have the version yet but in the next lesson we will take care of it.

07:07.660 --> 07:16.620
We got the author's name and if I mouseover this link you'll see the URL to the author goes in it.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.330
OK now let's take a short break.

07:19.360 --> 07:26.050
In this video and when we come back in the next lesson I'll show you how to activate the theme using

07:26.050 --> 07:26.810
the size sheet.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.340
We are just creating.

07:28.630 --> 07:30.480
Until then and happy going.
