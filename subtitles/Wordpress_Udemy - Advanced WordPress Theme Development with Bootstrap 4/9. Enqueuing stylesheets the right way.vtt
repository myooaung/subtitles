00:00.390 --> 00:06.240
Hello guys in this lesson you're going to start learning about one of the most important files of a

00:06.280 --> 00:11.300
word pressing the functions that speech be file at the end of this lesson.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.760
You're going to be able to load and establish it within your scene.

00:14.850 --> 00:18.740
And the most important thing the right way and the last lesson.

00:18.780 --> 00:24.690
We just started creating the out splitting our index into three parts.

00:24.840 --> 00:31.530
We created the header footer and made our next that bitch be more than Nemec including the functions

00:31.530 --> 00:35.480
that called both the header and the soon to start lesson.

00:35.520 --> 00:41.320
Let's just point out all of our sections so that we can later style our theme.

00:41.490 --> 00:44.400
Let's start with Hetter that's typing here.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.050
Social icons.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.660
And here search Lowville

00:55.110 --> 00:57.660
menu.

00:57.740 --> 01:01.060
Let's save this now and open the next file.

01:02.570 --> 01:05.010
Here you're going to type in slide

01:07.670 --> 01:08.510
services

01:11.230 --> 01:11.980
here in the middle.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.480
We have the side bar

01:16.640 --> 01:17.250
news

01:20.400 --> 01:21.010
map.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.190
OK.

01:23.260 --> 01:27.580
Now you can save it now in our footer.

01:27.580 --> 01:28.980
Let's create a paragraph

01:33.810 --> 01:38.230
rather usually include the stylesheet using only.

01:38.250 --> 01:45.750
Now we must simply create a CSSA folder organizer files in there and find a link tag for our WordPress

01:45.760 --> 01:46.360
thing.

01:46.490 --> 01:51.740
Let's do this within our lone WP folder which is the folder of our thing.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.030
So let's create a new folder here named CSX

01:58.700 --> 02:00.210
inside DSS folder.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.210
I'm going to create a file called template Dotsie access is down.

02:04.220 --> 02:06.260
You can choose a different name if you want.

02:06.260 --> 02:06.730
OK.

02:07.580 --> 02:13.670
There are several ways to load a stylesheet into WordPress but I'm going to show you the most recommended

02:13.670 --> 02:20.880
form the most appropriate way is to create a file named functions that should be within our field.

02:21.140 --> 02:28.580
If you look at other films such as the 2015 you see that it has a functions that PSP file as well.

02:28.640 --> 02:35.840
If you open that file you'll see that it has several functions inside the function that P2P file works

02:35.930 --> 02:38.720
as if it was a kind of plugin.

02:38.720 --> 02:45.710
However unlike plugins which work on the whole WordPress site that is it affects all things at once.

02:45.740 --> 02:50.430
Functions that PC only relates to the thing that is currently active.

02:50.750 --> 02:58.310
So whatever function I create within that function that piece B when the 20:15 is active will only apply

02:58.340 --> 03:00.580
to the 2015 theme.

03:00.590 --> 03:07.660
Likewise the function that BHP file We're going to create will only be valid for the learn W.P. thing.

03:07.700 --> 03:10.740
What makes this function that this file so different.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.790
What is this function.

03:13.190 --> 03:23.900
Well it can contain calls for our stylesheets scripts sidebars you're going to create menu functions

03:25.330 --> 03:30.890
video image settings whatever different post formats we may have.

03:30.970 --> 03:36.510
And we can also create our own specific functions in lower than in wordpress.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.130
It's a very versatile file.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.870
It always come in handy.

03:39.910 --> 03:42.200
And I love working with it.

03:42.340 --> 03:47.310
If you want to learn a little bit more you can always do that by opening the function of that piece

03:47.300 --> 03:49.520
B file of another thing.

03:49.660 --> 03:54.660
For now we're going to create our own file to load our own style sheets.

03:54.700 --> 04:01.150
But before I talk about what makes all of this magic happen I will try to explain more or less the dynamics

04:01.210 --> 04:03.060
of this whole process.

04:03.490 --> 04:09.030
Well the loading process of a WordPress site is a bit different from most Web sites.

04:09.040 --> 04:16.480
It's not just a simple process since it is a companion by several moments of execution where press calls

04:16.480 --> 04:22.950
them action hooks and some of these folks are assigned in the W.P. settings file.

04:22.950 --> 04:31.590
If you open that file and look for the term do underscore action you'll see Sabur of these hooks for

04:31.590 --> 04:35.630
example set up Thien is fired before the theme is loaded.

04:37.060 --> 04:41.560
There are two others like after set up thing in it.

04:42.810 --> 04:51.650
W.P. loaded hook that interests us the most in this lesson is W.P. and to use scripts that hook is inside

04:51.650 --> 04:54.510
the script loader that pupae file.

04:54.700 --> 05:02.910
Intern these files included on line 192 of the W.P. settings file and now we have a hook which will

05:02.910 --> 05:07.480
help us fire the function responsible for our starship's.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.890
But let's understand this better in practice.

05:10.980 --> 05:11.420
That's great.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.610
A new file in subline text and named functions.

05:14.610 --> 05:15.890
Not huge.

05:16.320 --> 05:23.410
This file will be created inside the lone WP folder and before any doubt arises.

05:23.460 --> 05:27.900
Yes this file must be called functionals dot Peachi.

05:28.020 --> 05:31.650
Don't forget the letter S at the end of the name again.

05:32.100 --> 05:40.290
Let's just start file with the PDP opening tag but notice that you're just going to open the tag but

05:40.290 --> 05:42.220
it won't close it.

05:42.900 --> 05:49.440
And now after that let's create a function as you know a PDB function starts with the word function

05:50.310 --> 05:54.580
followed by the function's name and our function's name.

05:54.600 --> 06:03.720
Will the load underscore scripts working on the Wordpress function that insert our stylesheets into

06:03.720 --> 06:04.340
queue.

06:04.430 --> 06:10.620
Is the WP anti-EU style function when this function is read.

06:10.800 --> 06:14.200
It will load our styles one underneath the other.

06:14.220 --> 06:20.590
You can see this later in the source code of the page but its function to do something we want to pass

06:20.630 --> 06:22.360
some parameters to it.

06:22.410 --> 06:27.880
The first one is a handle and what will the file handle be in the row.

06:28.050 --> 06:34.770
Since we have already created a file called template that says this will be our handle but it could

06:34.770 --> 06:38.210
be anything as long as we don't repeat those names.

06:38.220 --> 06:39.200
That's OK.

06:39.540 --> 06:44.130
The second parameter is used to print out the path to our file.

06:44.130 --> 06:48.960
There was a WordPress function to that and it's called Get template directory.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.350
You are I am the Usenet function.

06:52.380 --> 06:58.050
We need only say that this style sheet is inside the SS folder and is named late dad.

06:58.080 --> 07:10.520
C Ss the concatenated function to the string for Slash C Ss for Slash template that C Ss.

07:10.600 --> 07:15.980
The third parameter says whether or not our starship has any dependency.

07:16.180 --> 07:22.430
That is if there's any other stylesheet that needs to be loaded before our template that says that it's

07:22.450 --> 07:23.010
again.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.130
If it depends on some other file.

07:25.180 --> 07:30.490
If so we need to type out the handle of this fire inside an array.

07:30.490 --> 07:36.130
For example if there is a style sheet called data we would pass its name inside an array.

07:36.250 --> 07:43.390
Since we have no dependency we can leave only the array empty and other arguments that function needs

07:43.390 --> 07:44.830
its version.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.200
This argument is not required.

07:47.200 --> 07:52.210
We can type for example onepoint all which should be our stylesheet version.

07:52.310 --> 07:55.410
The version text would be concatenated with the file name.

07:55.480 --> 07:59.890
And again we can see the version number in the source code.

07:59.920 --> 08:06.120
The last parameter is used to let WordPress know what kind of media this SS file refers to.

08:06.310 --> 08:11.860
It could be print screen or all.

08:12.090 --> 08:18.630
All would be relative to all media types and it's the most common then you robot.

08:18.900 --> 08:26.310
But it's not enough to just declare the function no functions runs out magically within WordPress.

08:26.310 --> 08:31.330
We must first add this function to an action associating it with some Haug.

08:31.440 --> 08:37.950
Therefore you're going to associate our load scripts function with a whole code W.P. and use scripts

08:38.040 --> 08:41.500
so that it can actually be executed giant.

08:41.550 --> 08:43.040
The hook to the function.

08:43.040 --> 08:51.760
We're going to use another WordPress function called add underscore action your city's future Dean used

08:51.770 --> 08:53.930
many times in wordpress press.

08:53.950 --> 09:03.350
First we have to inform the name of the actual hook which in our case will be W.P. and q scripts and

09:03.350 --> 09:08.810
then the function that is going to be executed which is the one we just created.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.310
So what's going on here.

09:13.320 --> 09:18.490
In summary we had created our last scripts function inside it.

09:18.510 --> 09:26.880
Recall the function that queues our starship's called Played Dotsie SS whose path is this one here.

09:26.910 --> 09:34.160
It has no dependency its version is 1.0 and it applies to all types of media.

09:34.200 --> 09:41.400
The actual function adds and you action within the Wordpress execution then the Wordpress page follows

09:41.490 --> 09:49.510
and as soon as it loads we have several hooks available one of those hooks is called W.P. and scripts.

09:49.580 --> 09:56.790
We take advantage of this hook and have a function executed on it called load on the score scripts which

09:56.880 --> 10:05.940
in turn includes our starship's Wow amazing but none of this is possible if you don't require a function

10:05.940 --> 10:13.440
call W.P. underscore head within our head or that page be file it needs to be placed before the head

10:13.440 --> 10:14.990
tag ends.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.300
So let's open the page bit like here.

10:17.310 --> 10:27.040
Antiope and W.P. underscore had without this function no scripts or starship's including those used

10:27.040 --> 10:30.220
by WordPress plugins would be loaded.

10:30.220 --> 10:34.160
We can now open our Fernan and see if everything is working.

10:34.270 --> 10:35.620
That's really the Bache

10:39.150 --> 10:46.250
and look here we have all the markup we made if inspect the code you'll see that several things that

10:46.250 --> 10:49.250
were not here before now are loaded.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.060
Check this out.

10:52.680 --> 10:57.330
All this code was loaded because of the W.P. had function.

10:57.540 --> 11:01.110
Let's see if our station is in diskless

11:04.690 --> 11:09.740
and look at this template dobbed see SS with its handle.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.030
It's back to version one point.

11:12.040 --> 11:19.150
All that well-defined type of media and we can finally test our stoush it out.

11:19.450 --> 11:22.520
Let's go through the rules for our top bar.

11:22.810 --> 11:26.830
Let's just set the color red and the hide for that area

11:29.410 --> 11:32.080
so background red.

11:34.040 --> 11:38.300
White 70 pixels.

11:38.400 --> 11:44.670
Let's once again reload the home page and it works perfectly.

11:44.670 --> 11:48.220
Now we can style the rest of the page with no problem.

11:49.360 --> 11:55.600
Well that was of this lesson in the next lesson you're going and learn how to load our scripts and more

11:55.930 --> 12:00.100
let's learn in practice how to integrate bootstrap into the theme.

12:00.190 --> 12:02.490
Something that many people struggle Aledo.

12:02.530 --> 12:04.410
So don't miss the next class.

12:04.430 --> 12:06.120
Until then happy coding.
