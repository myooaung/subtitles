Hello we are back here for a new lesson in this lesson.

00:04.680 --> 00:12.500
We're going to talk about the so called W.P. query Well for those who have never heard of it.

00:12.500 --> 00:19.550
WP Querrey is a very powerful WordPress class that allows us to make a modification to the default WordPress

00:19.580 --> 00:27.810
loop sometimes called the main query and you may ask me Marcello what is that default WordPress loop.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.400
I've never heard of it.

00:29.780 --> 00:37.320
Well every time you open a page or a post what we see is this default Word Press loop in action.

00:37.550 --> 00:40.180
So you already know it.

00:40.340 --> 00:47.360
We have already created one of these loops in our index file which generates a post listing for us that's

00:47.450 --> 00:48.950
on our blog page.

00:49.070 --> 00:55.310
But as the name says We're talking about a default look there are times that we want to change that

00:55.310 --> 00:59.160
loop if we want to have a visually different result.

00:59.210 --> 01:05.090
For example if you look again at the design of the home page of the theme we are building we can see

01:05.090 --> 01:09.630
that it has this section where we have this future news.

01:09.800 --> 01:15.250
It is followed by this to other secondary items with a default WordPress loop.

01:15.260 --> 01:18.170
We cannot achieve this and why.

01:18.470 --> 01:24.350
Basically because we need shoe loops on the same page to achieve this result.

01:24.410 --> 01:31.070
WP Querrey is a class that allows us to make changes to this main query and have as a result something

01:31.070 --> 01:32.010
like this.

01:32.350 --> 01:37.790
OK but before we start writing any code let's start by showing some things that I have prepared for

01:37.790 --> 01:39.360
this lesson.

01:39.550 --> 01:46.020
Well in addition to the CSSA modifications made here to the services area which you can see later in

01:46.020 --> 01:50.780
the files available for download is made some minor changes in the backend.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.710
Let's go over to the dashboard.

01:53.750 --> 01:59.450
The first thing I did was modify the post I'd use for some of the items we have already created in other

01:59.450 --> 02:01.810
license.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.160
So there's nothing new here.

02:04.510 --> 02:04.870
OK.

02:04.930 --> 02:09.970
So we're going to start by opening the file which is our home templates.

02:10.210 --> 02:18.870
At this point everyone is tired of knowing that that file is the page home that BHP file the first thing

02:18.900 --> 02:26.020
you're going to need to create is the mail markup if you create a new row inside the new section.

02:26.250 --> 02:29.380
Well why do I need to create this role here.

02:29.700 --> 02:30.610
To answer that.

02:30.630 --> 02:39.060
Let's take a look at our layout as you can see this entire region here is already in a row within that

02:39.060 --> 02:39.830
row.

02:40.020 --> 02:42.360
We have these two columns.

02:42.360 --> 02:49.850
One is the side bar with three columns and the other is where our news will be placed with nine columns.

02:50.710 --> 02:55.340
Now here in this news area we're going to have another column division.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.920
Let's imagine that this new row also has 12 columns.

02:59.920 --> 03:07.120
We're going to have a news item that you occupy a space of columns in this new row and here below.

03:07.180 --> 03:09.720
We're going to have two more news items.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.900
Each one occupying six columns.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
There you see it.

03:14.170 --> 03:16.360
So we need a new row here.

03:16.570 --> 03:18.930
It's a basic bootstrap room.

03:18.940 --> 03:21.090
It has nothing to do with wordpress.

03:21.090 --> 03:21.630
OK.

03:21.820 --> 03:28.560
This is just H.E. AML and CSSA OK for each news we'll be creating a new word press.

03:28.570 --> 03:31.940
Look the first one is going to be used for the future Eitan.

03:32.410 --> 03:39.430
And the other one is going to close the other two news items and that's the advantage of WP Querrey

03:39.760 --> 03:41.760
as you see in the next license.

03:41.920 --> 03:48.010
It allows us to have more than one word press look on the same page with different parameters for each

03:48.010 --> 03:55.470
one OK since this topic may be a little difficult to understand and going to divide this lessons into

03:55.620 --> 03:59.270
four parts to make it easier for you to understand.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.810
I'll try not to rush things.

04:02.190 --> 04:08.250
So in the next lesson we come back and you understand in practice how to create this custom queries

04:08.340 --> 04:09.630
in wordpress.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.060
So see you later.
