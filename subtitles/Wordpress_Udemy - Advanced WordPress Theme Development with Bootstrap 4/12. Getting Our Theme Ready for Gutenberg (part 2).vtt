00:00.910 --> 00:05.800
HELLO GUYS I'M BACK to continue talking about Gutenberg in the last lesson.

00:05.800 --> 00:12.550
I made an introduction about this new tool we installed Gutenberg and explained a little about this

00:12.550 --> 00:15.450
new auditing experience in wordpress.

00:15.790 --> 00:22.920
As I told you it looks a little like most page builder such as the visual composer and so on.

00:23.380 --> 00:29.190
But there's still some hard work to do while the Wordpress team works hard to improve Gutenburg.

00:29.380 --> 00:35.140
I'm going to show you all that's available at the moment and especially show you what your film can

00:35.140 --> 00:39.360
do to get the most out of Gutenburg in this lesson.

00:39.360 --> 00:45.220
I'm going to spend some time explaining to you some of the basic features of the new good and bad editor.

00:45.480 --> 00:52.020
As I said in previous lessons the goal is not to explain everything about all the tools available even

00:52.020 --> 00:56.220
because Gutenberg is a project that is still evolving.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.230
Many things are yet to come.

00:58.380 --> 01:07.050
But as my students were very curious and eager to learn more about it and rightly so let's explore what

01:07.050 --> 01:08.270
we got until now.

01:09.180 --> 01:11.490
Let's first take a look at the lay out.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.890
As I said before it has nothing to do with class Ed..

01:15.900 --> 01:23.360
The tiny MC Adager in fact good Enberg resolves around the basic elements wishes.

01:23.430 --> 01:30.290
The so called block everything in the layout resolves around these blocks.

01:30.360 --> 01:36.710
So if you hover over the document you see that every little element here is a block.

01:36.780 --> 01:47.110
We have a name H-Block paragraph blocks headers lists and they can all be identified by this little

01:47.110 --> 01:52.400
two tips that show when the mouse over each of them look.

01:52.630 --> 01:59.380
One interesting thing is that they are highly interactive so you can move a block up and down.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.290
Just the click of the mouse.

02:02.790 --> 02:07.730
Drag and drop to rearrange blocks may also be available but not now.

02:07.790 --> 02:13.930
Maybe in the near future which will make Gutenburg even more dynamic and maybe when you're watching

02:13.930 --> 02:18.250
this video this function is already in place for now.

02:18.250 --> 02:25.360
What they got is a functionality called the inserter the inserter is this plus button that you can see

02:25.420 --> 02:28.130
right here just below each block.

02:28.210 --> 02:37.310
For example here or here in this toolbar at the top the main goal is to facilitate as much as possible

02:37.340 --> 02:40.500
the insertion of any block in the editing area.

02:40.880 --> 02:48.170
So by clicking this plus button you'll have access to all the blocks and these blocks can be of various

02:48.170 --> 02:56.710
types from simple Cheng's subtexts paragraphs to elements that until now were hidden in wordpress.

02:56.990 --> 03:04.580
For example did you know that you could embed a YouTube or Vimeo video or any media content from all

03:04.580 --> 03:07.540
of this other services without any plug in.

03:07.760 --> 03:16.070
Yeah a lot of people have no idea now that the blocks the whole thing became much clearer and the whole

03:16.070 --> 03:22.910
idea is that any kind of content that can be added to the editor area will be available as a block in

03:22.910 --> 03:23.840
the future.

03:23.840 --> 03:30.570
So the user will never need to use shortcuts anymore or any piece of a tiny amount called there will

03:30.620 --> 03:35.980
only need to choose a block and place the content wherever they want.

03:36.110 --> 03:45.000
Cosiness Well then you may ask me what Marcello what happened to the content like post pages content

03:45.320 --> 03:48.010
that are already have on my wordpress installation.

03:48.270 --> 03:52.420
What will become of them really need to recreate everything from scratch.

03:53.220 --> 03:59.100
Well to answer this regardless of this demo content behind for a moment and we're going to open one

03:59.100 --> 04:05.030
of the posts that is Serveti saved in our WordPress site open up this one here

04:07.780 --> 04:12.340
well look as you can see it seems like everything is still in place.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.660
What happens when you activate the editor.

04:14.820 --> 04:21.800
Is that WordPress moves everything inside the single block which is called the classic block.

04:21.870 --> 04:27.960
Basically the classic block which you can find also true the inserter look.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.890
Its all others are tiny.

04:29.890 --> 04:36.810
MC That is if you want to continue using the tiny MC inside Gutenburg you can.

04:36.870 --> 04:39.310
Its possible if you want.

04:39.330 --> 04:45.510
You can also convert everything into blocks here on the right side you have some actions related to

04:45.510 --> 04:50.510
the block which will of course rise from block to block.

04:50.610 --> 04:58.590
In this example I can convert this classic content into a block by clicking here in convert to blocks.

04:58.650 --> 05:01.970
In this case I end up with two paragraphs.

05:02.580 --> 05:08.500
If I am not satisfied with the changes I made just click here on this little arrow.

05:08.750 --> 05:14.640
I can't go back here and ask to duplicate or remove the block.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.130
You can get the idea.

05:16.610 --> 05:19.590
Let's turn this content back into blocks.

05:20.080 --> 05:20.850
OK.

05:22.020 --> 05:24.290
So I have two paragraphs again here.

05:24.650 --> 05:26.890
So let me show you something else.

05:26.930 --> 05:32.970
Each block has its own settings and this rise from block to block for example here for the paragraph

05:32.970 --> 05:43.110
block I have some basic formatting options bold italic alignment and here on the side I have more options

05:43.110 --> 05:45.750
related only to the blocks selected.

05:45.750 --> 05:49.790
This box here is called the block inspector.

05:49.970 --> 05:52.020
Here I can as an example.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.260
Change the font size.

05:54.270 --> 06:05.400
I can use these buttons all the slider I can go to show a larger initial letter here under color settings

06:05.520 --> 06:10.200
I can choose the font color and also background color by default.

06:10.200 --> 06:17.280
I have these colors here but I can also choose in other colors later on we're going to learn how to

06:17.280 --> 06:20.570
make it the color palette for your theme available too.

06:20.880 --> 06:26.620
So if you want the client to be restricted to only a few colors for example you can do it.

06:26.940 --> 06:33.090
And for most blocks you can also add a special census class that's going to be very useful if you want

06:33.090 --> 06:41.700
to customize them pretty much like what we got in most pages this out there this other tag called document

06:42.190 --> 06:46.090
gives you access to all settings related to the post as a whole.

06:46.500 --> 06:53.000
Pretty much like we already had in the older editor as mega-bucks is only the layout is a bit different.

06:54.110 --> 07:01.850
One of the advantages of this tool is that if any field theme hasn't yet added any support you Gutenburg

07:02.240 --> 07:08.680
it allows us to have a very consistent look both here in the editor and in the front end.

07:08.960 --> 07:15.260
So both versions can look quite the same yet you can always take a look at how different that looks

07:15.260 --> 07:18.750
like by clicking here on this preview button.

07:19.390 --> 07:25.630
As we have already tweaked the post a little we can have a look at how it's getting a click here in

07:25.630 --> 07:30.620
Preview and the front and opens in the new tab.

07:31.420 --> 07:36.260
Sometimes you'll notice a boring bug here as it try to preview the post.

07:36.370 --> 07:42.400
You see that if you click the update button before previewing the results the button will be endlessly

07:42.400 --> 07:44.320
processing to view the page.

07:44.320 --> 07:50.840
You have to reload the editor and then click preview again then the page will load.

07:51.050 --> 07:57.970
Oh so sometimes you see some arrows display and say that the update has failed as we saw at the beginning

07:57.970 --> 07:59.220
of this lesson.

07:59.220 --> 08:03.470
I hope that in the future they can correct that.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.090
Let's try some more.

08:05.470 --> 08:11.800
Let's suppose I want to insert in an image gallery here between these two paragraphs.

08:11.800 --> 08:19.870
For me this gallery block which is a native Gutenburg lock is one of the most incredible blocks.

08:19.930 --> 08:22.440
It simply works out of the box.

08:22.930 --> 08:26.620
So you create a new gallery Let's go hadn't used inserter.

08:26.890 --> 08:31.440
It may be this one here or this one here too.

08:31.480 --> 08:37.720
The difference is that when you choose to use this one at stop you need to reposition the block later

08:37.720 --> 08:41.840
because it's going to be placed at the end of the post.

08:41.980 --> 08:46.570
So I'm going to use this one here and see the block.

08:46.570 --> 08:53.530
I have a couple of different options I can choose a block here where some of the recently used blocks

08:53.530 --> 09:03.550
which show I can click here on this plus I can and look for the block here or use the search box or

09:03.550 --> 09:05.920
I can do it the easiest way.

09:06.250 --> 09:10.720
I'm going to type a slash and then write the name of the block I want.

09:10.870 --> 09:18.600
For example slash Guillory and I don't even have to write the full name of the block.

09:18.610 --> 09:22.170
Look for example slash you.

09:22.380 --> 09:25.230
It's already showing me the huge You block and so on

09:30.630 --> 09:37.000
just hit enter and they can set up some options from a block in this case I'm going to choose a couple

09:37.000 --> 09:41.170
of images that they already have in this WordPress installation.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.390
I can upload some new images too if I wish.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.370
I'm going to select these three images and that's it.

09:53.610 --> 09:55.970
And the gallery is already in place.

09:56.670 --> 10:04.610
In this case it's three column gallery and if you wish you can come here and choose only two columns.

10:04.790 --> 10:05.910
See what happens.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.730
Look how cool.

10:09.110 --> 10:11.890
So let's see if it's showing up right on the front end.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.180
And there you have it.

10:19.510 --> 10:20.100
Perfect.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.440
Now the whole thing don't stop here.

10:24.460 --> 10:31.180
Gutenburg has proved to us to use new types of alignment those alignments will affect blocks such as

10:31.180 --> 10:34.930
images image galleries videos etc..

10:35.320 --> 10:41.410
You can choose between an alignment called White and the second one called food.

10:41.800 --> 10:47.110
In the next lesson I'm going to show you how to enable this alignments in the theme because by default

10:47.110 --> 10:48.760
they are not enabled.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.150
We only get this three kinds of alignments up here.

10:53.150 --> 10:56.980
Another thing you can do with the blocks is turn them into something else.

10:57.130 --> 11:02.370
For example a gallery block can be converted into a single image block.

11:02.470 --> 11:09.400
Just click here on the first button of this area here which by the way has a name it's called the floating

11:09.400 --> 11:15.010
menu bar and it'll show you a list of blocks you can convert it into.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.830
This of course will arise from block to block.

11:18.130 --> 11:21.520
And of course not all blocks who have this feature here.

11:21.940 --> 11:26.890
In this case we can transform the gallery into individual image blocks look

11:32.820 --> 11:36.670
and of course if you want to reverse this action you can always click here.

11:38.380 --> 11:44.110
Or if you have already closed the post editor you can reverted back to the older version by clicking

11:44.110 --> 11:47.790
this revision button later on this course.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.230
Talk about other features but that's enough for now.

11:51.400 --> 11:58.000
I believe you had an interesting idea of how Gutenburg works for those who want to learn more of course.

11:58.070 --> 12:03.800
I'll leave a link of a greater chore you that explains in detail how other blocks work inside.

12:03.830 --> 12:10.480
Good work and this link will be available in the extra materials for this lesson and the next lesson

12:10.480 --> 12:13.010
we are going to start working with the thin files.

12:13.120 --> 12:19.550
So lets first see how to add support for those two special alignments that I mentioned today and you'll

12:19.560 --> 12:24.430
begin to understand the connections between Arfin and the good in the editor.

12:24.430 --> 12:26.290
So until then see your.
