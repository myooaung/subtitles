Hello Guys welcome to one more lesson in this section.

00:05.150 --> 00:11.330
Actually this is going to be the last lesson and today we are going to install a plugin that will help

00:11.330 --> 00:14.190
us display a responsive menu on the screen.

00:14.920 --> 00:21.020
Ever since the beginning of this course we have already done a really cool job using bootstrap to make

00:21.020 --> 00:23.770
our site as responsive as possible.

00:23.770 --> 00:27.650
However one thing that is still not working is the menu.

00:27.850 --> 00:35.800
If we enable the browser element Inspektor on a Mac command option I on the PC control sheafs I already

00:35.800 --> 00:37.250
have 12 button.

00:37.570 --> 00:44.160
We see that when it gets to very small screen resolutions our menu starts to get weird.

00:44.230 --> 00:50.340
There will come a time when it will be totally broken but we don't want this to happen.

00:50.540 --> 00:57.520
To solve that we're going to install a very simple very lightweight plugin called WP responsive menu.

00:57.970 --> 01:02.350
It's very easy to set up and I always use it in my projects.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.990
And you see why so let's look for this plug in.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.140
Install it.

01:14.860 --> 01:19.610
And activate it once installed.

01:19.640 --> 01:22.610
We have a new item here in the dashboard menu.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.930
Let's click here on W.P. our menu

01:29.670 --> 01:32.400
so here we get six steps.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.550
The new version of this plugin brings a lot of new functionalities.

01:36.630 --> 01:42.580
Many of them are bringing in futures even though this is still a very good plug in.

01:42.790 --> 01:51.630
We'll be concentrating on these two first steps general and appearance so under General one of the first

01:51.630 --> 01:56.370
options here is what menu we want to use as a responsive menu.

01:56.370 --> 02:02.370
Remember we have two menus one at the top of the page and one at the bottom.

02:02.490 --> 02:10.140
Let's juice your the top menu the next setting is very important which is specify here what HDMI element

02:10.140 --> 02:11.190
is going to be hidden.

02:11.220 --> 02:18.030
As soon as the responsive menu appears on the screen generally we type here the menu class that we want

02:18.030 --> 02:21.180
to become responsive to figure this out.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.950
We have to the code for the menu.

02:24.330 --> 02:34.860
Let's go back to the thing and let's find out why is the CEO says glass of the main menu.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.860
Look here we found out as copy this glass main menu

02:42.960 --> 02:44.180
and base it here.

02:45.290 --> 02:53.700
I state a dot before since it's CSSA class name search input within menu.

02:53.970 --> 03:00.310
You can choose whether or not you display a search box in the menu and below which text will appear

03:00.310 --> 03:02.570
inside that box.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.330
There are many other options here.

03:04.330 --> 03:11.290
For example you can choose a logo to be displayed in the menu enable the swipe effect and a couple of

03:11.290 --> 03:12.090
other options.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.260
You can tweak later if you want.

03:14.260 --> 03:14.870
OK.

03:16.040 --> 03:22.850
Now under appearance there are also a lot of options you can later on change if you will concentrate

03:22.910 --> 03:25.220
here on the main options.

03:25.250 --> 03:32.500
You can choose here the menu I can position and direction also the kind of animation the menu you have.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.690
It won't change anything for now.

03:34.940 --> 03:41.540
But the most important option is the next one here we need to define the width in pixels below which

03:41.740 --> 03:44.850
our response of menu will become visible.

03:45.110 --> 03:48.770
Let's add it you 767 pixels.

03:48.950 --> 03:55.560
That is when the screen resolution is less than or equal to 767 pixels.

03:55.770 --> 04:02.470
Responsive menu will appear and the regular menu that is not responsive will simply disappear.

04:02.510 --> 04:09.680
Below we get a bunch of other options related to the style which menu item and also submit news.

04:09.770 --> 04:12.580
We're going to go ahead and accepts the suggestions.

04:13.660 --> 04:20.040
And also accept callers suggested by the Plug-In Let's save the changes.

04:21.120 --> 04:27.060
And after we save we can see a live preview on the right side of the page which is very helpful.

04:30.300 --> 04:36.890
Anyway let's jump to our thing because we need to see how it's behaving on different screen resolutions.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.460
Let's refresh the page

04:41.330 --> 04:45.490
and I'll watch slowly going down.

04:45.500 --> 04:53.130
Resolution this year that we can see the size of the current resolution in pixels.

04:53.150 --> 05:04.100
Remember when we reach 767 pixels our response has been you have to appear as go or go down.

05:04.670 --> 05:08.380
And that's it erased 706 767 big sales.

05:08.470 --> 05:11.100
And the response of many is already here.

05:11.150 --> 05:16.970
That's let's see if the menu itself is working.

05:17.070 --> 05:19.340
Click Here you go to the contact page

05:22.080 --> 05:26.640
and we're here on the Contact page.

05:26.650 --> 05:29.710
Let's open the menu again and return to the home page

05:33.580 --> 05:34.270
excellent.

05:34.270 --> 05:37.000
Everything's working just perfect.

05:37.030 --> 05:43.170
Is it that we just feel settings now have a responsive menu on Arfin now.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.590
But there's still one thing that has not convinced me at all.

05:47.590 --> 05:54.370
You may ask me Marcello and if I'm making this theme available for download How will my user know that

05:54.370 --> 05:57.000
he or she needs to install this blowing in.

05:57.010 --> 06:04.060
If they want a responsive menu this is also a valid question about the social media plugging the slider

06:04.060 --> 06:08.420
plug in and any other plug in you decide to include in Arfin.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.720
Well that's a great question.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.090
So let's make a deal.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.200
Get this question right in your heart.

06:15.200 --> 06:15.810
Okay.

06:16.040 --> 06:20.600
You're not going to answer it now but only at the end of the course.

06:20.630 --> 06:26.450
After we finished out the theme this will be interesting for those who intend to create themes to make

06:26.450 --> 06:27.820
available to other people.

06:27.830 --> 06:33.830
For example people who want to sell items on thin forest which is a well-known marketplace for selling

06:33.830 --> 06:35.240
WordPress themes.

06:35.630 --> 06:39.260
So I'll wait for you in the next section of the course.

06:39.500 --> 06:46.400
We'll be learning about one of the most interesting WordPress tools called the famed customize or until

06:46.400 --> 06:48.050
then decoding.
