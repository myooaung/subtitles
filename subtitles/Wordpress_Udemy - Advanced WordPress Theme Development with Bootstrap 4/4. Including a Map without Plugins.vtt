00:01.020 --> 00:08.100
Hello in today's lesson finally you learn how to book the map from Google at the bottom of our thing.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.350
My initial thought was to install one more plug in to do this.

00:11.370 --> 00:14.140
But to create Smarr without the use of plugins.

00:14.140 --> 00:22.060
This time however for those of you who prefer to use plugins one I recommend is W.T. Google Maps and

00:22.080 --> 00:25.450
use it in some of my projects quite successfully.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.380
But the one thing I don't like sometimes in plugins and this also holds true for some premium themes

00:31.410 --> 00:35.670
is that they bring in many features of which we only use one or two.

00:35.970 --> 00:41.050
So let's get our hands dirty this time with a bit of piece be called for this lesson.

00:41.060 --> 00:44.960
We use the Google maps in embed API and it's place mode.

00:45.270 --> 00:50.750
And here is a note since this lesson is an updated version of the original content of this course.

00:51.120 --> 00:58.320
I had to rewrite this lesson because since June 11 2018 Google has changed the way of getting the necessary

00:58.320 --> 01:05.010
API key to run the map service for every individual or application that wants to use the service.

01:05.010 --> 01:11.840
In summary if you want to place the Google map on your site via API you want to be able to ignore any

01:11.850 --> 01:13.760
process I'm about to describe.

01:14.100 --> 01:20.620
While our record is video there is still little information about it outside of Google's own that communication

01:20.890 --> 01:23.160
which is not always easy to understand.

01:23.430 --> 01:29.910
So if I have any other news I'm going to update the lesson once again and notify you or by e-mail or

01:29.910 --> 01:30.630
some other way.

01:30.630 --> 01:31.440
OK.

01:31.920 --> 01:40.140
But the good news is that for 98 99 percent of the cases those API keys will still remain 100 percent

01:40.140 --> 01:41.400
free.

01:41.400 --> 01:48.600
Well this according to Google which also promises some improvements like 24 hours support and improved

01:48.630 --> 01:50.450
performance et cetera.

01:50.780 --> 01:55.100
So let's go let's implement roadmap for this to be possible.

01:55.110 --> 01:58.570
We'll open the Google documentation to understand how it works.

01:58.590 --> 02:02.670
This link will be available to you in the additional material on this lecture.

02:02.670 --> 02:02.960
OK.

02:02.970 --> 02:04.540
So don't worry about it.

02:04.860 --> 02:07.350
Well this API works quite simply.

02:07.380 --> 02:12.910
Basically it adds frim with information from a map of a particular location.

02:12.930 --> 02:20.830
There are five types of maps which Google calls modes get placed mode which we use in this less than

02:21.210 --> 02:22.180
view mode.

02:23.600 --> 02:31.110
Directions mode street view mode and search mode.

02:33.010 --> 02:38.800
Now this last three modes are part of which they call now and then map modes.

02:39.010 --> 02:45.940
I must confess I didn't understand yet how it will work for these other cases but it seems that if you

02:45.940 --> 02:52.600
want access to them you'll necessarily have to pay that is whenever a visitor access your site when

02:52.600 --> 02:57.730
it opens a map with these advanced services you have to pay for it.

02:57.740 --> 03:04.390
But the place Mole's that we're going to implement in this course as you understand later is still free

03:04.390 --> 03:07.880
for most of the projects to implement this maps.

03:07.930 --> 03:10.960
You basically need a Google API key.

03:11.020 --> 03:18.670
First let's go back to the top of the page and bring in a copy of the contents of this I-frame has opened

03:18.670 --> 03:24.140
up that page home that page profile and you're going to see where our map will be placed.

03:25.760 --> 03:32.270
Let's delete what we have here including this container and this row which you will not need because

03:32.420 --> 03:34.830
the map was banned from right or left.

03:35.150 --> 03:37.540
And let's face the frame here.

03:40.120 --> 03:46.900
Legs modified this markup a bit so that the appearance of the map stays the way we want.

03:46.940 --> 03:54.510
Let's change the with to 100 percent the height is 250.

03:54.570 --> 03:57.110
Add in other information and the end of this.

03:58.160 --> 04:09.140
Ampersand zoom ECOs 15 This ensures that this map will start with the value of 15 which is the zoom

04:09.140 --> 04:16.160
value that allows us to build the streets on the map at a good distance not to make the map really customized.

04:16.160 --> 04:21.440
When the two pieces of information the first one is the services API key.

04:21.650 --> 04:26.120
Without this key the map will not be shown on the page.

04:26.240 --> 04:32.920
A couple of years ago it was possible to implement a map like this one without the key but not anymore.

04:33.290 --> 04:40.640
As I told you at the beginning of the lesson since June 2018 Google has changed the process a little.

04:40.650 --> 04:46.880
Basically the company now requires every user to enable billing information to their account in order

04:46.880 --> 04:49.570
to activate the Google Maps API.

04:50.030 --> 04:56.420
However the good news is that Google gives all users enough free credit every month so that the vast

04:56.420 --> 05:00.890
majority of sites will never have to pay anything for that service.

05:01.130 --> 05:08.570
That's why I said to you at the beginning of the lesson that for 98 percent or 99 percent of cases this

05:08.660 --> 05:10.910
API will remain free.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.450
At least that's what Google promises.

05:13.580 --> 05:18.020
But at the end of the video I'm going to give you some tips on this.

05:18.020 --> 05:27.440
Well let's continue then go back to the Google Maps Web site and here below we have all the instructions

05:27.500 --> 05:30.820
on how to get a key to generate a key.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.230
However you'll need a Google account.

05:33.230 --> 05:37.750
If you don't have one yet you can create yours for free as well.

05:38.390 --> 05:40.800
Let's click here on get a key

05:44.320 --> 05:45.410
get started.

05:48.770 --> 05:55.040
And here's the big change once you ask to generate the key this little window here from Google Maps

05:55.110 --> 06:00.200
platform will appear as you see here has three steps to follow.

06:00.300 --> 06:07.280
First to choose the type of service then select or create a project and finally enable billing.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.250
Let's start by checking this first option.

06:10.310 --> 06:13.110
Maps continue.

06:13.610 --> 06:18.130
And in this new popup window you can select or create a new project.

06:18.410 --> 06:24.950
If that's your first project here you can choose this default project called my project or create a

06:24.950 --> 06:26.830
new one with another name.

06:27.170 --> 06:43.130
Let's create a new project let's call it learn W.P. key next.

06:43.210 --> 06:47.000
And now Google is asking you to enable building for the project.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.200
We have created.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.200
Well mine is in Portuguese.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.090
I don't know why.

06:51.130 --> 06:57.910
Maybe because the language is automatically set based on my location but there is no problem because

06:58.070 --> 07:01.800
I'll be translating every text to its English equivalent.

07:01.880 --> 07:07.780
During the rest of the video and maybe the next steps and screens will be slightly different depending

07:07.840 --> 07:11.220
on the country you live in or on your language.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.490
But anyway I think you won't have any problems.

07:14.860 --> 07:21.160
Hey don't be scared about the step that is asking you to create a bean counter case because the whole

07:21.160 --> 07:26.030
service will be free since June 2018.

07:26.170 --> 07:32.950
Google requires that all accounts use the Mac platform enable information but at the same time it gives

07:32.950 --> 07:38.680
you a monthly credit of $200 so that you can use the service without paying for it.

07:38.680 --> 07:43.020
The difference is that in the past you didn't have to create a billion account.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.810
In practice what happened to me was this.

07:47.170 --> 07:54.760
As I already have a Mac project I received an email from the company on May 2nd saying that based on

07:54.760 --> 08:01.120
my project usage over the last three months I would still have access to their service without having

08:01.120 --> 08:04.920
to pay anything beyond that two hundred dollars credit.

08:05.320 --> 08:13.420
Well if you stop and think and I think that's what Google has concluded $200 is more than enough for

08:13.420 --> 08:15.810
most web sites implement in the map.

08:16.120 --> 08:22.680
Just to illustrate on this page you can see how far you can go with this $200 credit.

08:23.020 --> 08:25.790
Here regards some usage examples.

08:27.570 --> 08:32.440
And I think you can see that the number of Web loads is more than enough for most cases.

08:32.440 --> 08:39.760
In fact the few cases where this is not going to be enough will be for large scale companies or for

08:39.760 --> 08:47.590
startups there is people that really can't afford paying more than $200 a month on Google services which

08:47.590 --> 08:54.880
is not your case I believe and here below we have the Frequently Asked Questions for example can I still

08:54.880 --> 08:57.100
use Google Maps platform for free.

08:57.370 --> 09:05.550
And here they say yes in explaining why this other link here with the price list will also be available

09:05.550 --> 09:06.470
to you.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.780
And here you can see the usage limits you have for each API key.

09:11.830 --> 09:12.460
Okay.

09:12.850 --> 09:19.150
Here on the same page you also have that link that you can access to manage your account according to

09:19.150 --> 09:25.760
Google or you can easily said use age limits to protect against unexpected cost increases.

09:25.840 --> 09:32.400
Anyway I think you have already understood that you hardly have to pay for the service as it was before.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.750
So lets go back to the previous page.

09:35.960 --> 09:44.060
Click here to create a billion account write a name for your bidding account.

09:44.230 --> 09:45.330
Click here.

09:48.860 --> 09:51.820
Choose a country and your currency

09:56.030 --> 09:58.260
and here you enter the billion data.

09:58.640 --> 10:04.280
If you already have an associated billing account for example if you have already purchased an app in

10:04.280 --> 10:08.630
place for your billing information you've already been shown here.

10:09.020 --> 10:11.790
In our case let's create one from scratch.

10:21.510 --> 10:26.450
Choose individual I'm going to feel like my data here

10:53.420 --> 10:59.740
and here is this warning you pay for this service only after you accrue costs.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.190
Before clicking here just turned my free trial.

11:02.330 --> 11:06.930
I'm going to talk about a question I received from a student of this course.

11:07.040 --> 11:15.100
So here's the question when a Buddha said for a customer how should I proceed as it will be rather complicated

11:15.100 --> 11:20.120
to let the customer register his or her credit card to get an AP ID.

11:20.170 --> 11:23.280
Is it safe to use my own google account for that.

11:23.350 --> 11:30.550
And what if I registered at API key on my credit card and the customer at some point has a lot of requests

11:30.730 --> 11:34.820
on that APHC then I would sit on unwanted invoices.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.590
How could I prevent that just by choosing that project.

11:38.590 --> 11:40.470
How would you approach this.

11:40.990 --> 11:45.800
Well in the past I would say that it doesn't matter who's going to register the IPO key.

11:46.060 --> 11:52.700
But now I advise you to ask your clients to create the key with his or her own Google account.

11:52.750 --> 11:58.770
You never know how he or she used this service and how fast their website will grow.

11:59.050 --> 12:05.270
So if the website grows a lot over time the number of requests will increase of course.

12:05.410 --> 12:12.340
And you the developer is not the one who's going to pay for it and you may say Marcello I don't like

12:12.340 --> 12:14.160
this technique that you're showing.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.700
It's very complicated and involves a credit card.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.410
I'm going to install a plug in.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.400
I think that's easier.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.860
No wrong option.

12:24.250 --> 12:29.850
And the plug in that you install will also as huge a generator Goo-Goo API key.

12:30.130 --> 12:34.400
So there's no way out if you want a map from Google on your website.

12:34.660 --> 12:36.810
It's a map that is not static.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.610
Well let's go back to Google.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.960
So let's move on.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.820
Click here to go to the next screen

12:54.350 --> 12:57.600
and enable my API key.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.020
Wait a minute.

13:04.880 --> 13:05.880
And there it is.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.790
We already get the API key when needed.

13:09.380 --> 13:12.830
And here is give you advice to restrict this key.

13:12.950 --> 13:20.440
This is quite interesting and important so that you generate the keys used only in your project.

13:20.510 --> 13:27.980
For example only on your website or only in your application since you're using this key on a local

13:27.980 --> 13:30.520
server there is no problem in use.

13:30.530 --> 13:32.920
And then the street is key for now.

13:33.170 --> 13:37.850
But it's interesting that you always restrict the use of the key OK.

13:38.220 --> 13:44.720
Unfortunately as this lesson is becoming lengthy and just to stay on the subject I'm going to just point

13:44.720 --> 13:46.760
you out to a greater charge about that.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.520
OK.

13:47.700 --> 13:56.500
Let's go ahead and cop it is key and I spaced it inside the A-frame tag after this key equals strain.

13:57.290 --> 14:03.190
Now to finish out that we just need to start and address this address will allow the API to center the

14:03.200 --> 14:09.330
map and apply a marker exactly at this address since this is just a test.

14:09.380 --> 14:16.580
I'm just going to leave this address as it is now but notice that the dress has these plus signs if

14:16.580 --> 14:22.490
you decide to change your dress setting your home or your office address for example you only need to

14:22.490 --> 14:24.960
replace each space with a plus sign.

14:25.070 --> 14:25.800
That's it.

14:26.180 --> 14:32.930
But then you may ask me again but Marcella if I'm developing this film for a person who doesn't understand

14:32.930 --> 14:39.880
page B or it's Jamail they'll be forced to edit this file and set their address and key manually.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.530
This is not feasible.

14:41.540 --> 14:47.220
Don't you think not everyone knows how to write code how to edit a page file.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.780
My client surely don't know how to do that.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.510
Yes of course I agree with you.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.270
It's not feasible at all.

14:55.640 --> 15:02.030
But don't worry because by the end of this course I'm going to teach you how to turn all this into something

15:02.030 --> 15:04.870
much but much more dynamic.

15:04.910 --> 15:10.310
Just wait and trust me for now let's see what our map looks like.

15:10.850 --> 15:16.160
Let's visit the front end and let's see if the map is displayed correctly down there

15:27.860 --> 15:30.380
and look excellent.

15:30.530 --> 15:38.450
Here's our map centered on the dress we choose and the marker as I said hey what do you think you like

15:38.450 --> 15:39.190
it.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.040
Hope so.

15:40.310 --> 15:41.630
Excellent.

15:41.630 --> 15:47.010
And the next lesson we come back is to have much work to do so.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.250
See you then.

15:48.270 --> 15:48.970
Bye.
