Hello there in today's lesson you're going to learn how to handle search within a word breastfeeding

00:08.360 --> 00:15.770
Well the first thing I need to say to you is that not every website needs a search box search facility

00:16.100 --> 00:23.360
often makes more sense for large content rich Web sites for example a search box can be vital for any

00:23.360 --> 00:25.250
combers website.

00:25.310 --> 00:31.520
Anyway if you plan to distribute your thing it's essential that you give that possibility to your customers

00:31.910 --> 00:37.920
so it will be after them not you to decide whether or not to include the search box.

00:38.300 --> 00:43.110
That said let's start creating our search box because we don't have one yet.

00:43.190 --> 00:47.770
We only have the space reserved for it here at the top of our field.

00:48.350 --> 00:54.670
Well by now you should know that this region of the thing is all inside our head of that speech file.

00:55.220 --> 00:58.720
So let's open up this file for editing.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.360
You already have here all the H-E email markup.

01:02.360 --> 01:09.190
And we got the feature search box sizes defined using bootstrap and you have a search box here.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.330
It's very easy.

01:10.380 --> 01:19.870
We just need to call the get search form function here and it find space nothing more less safe and

01:19.900 --> 01:21.780
open up our thing.

01:24.270 --> 01:27.850
And heres our search box first.

01:28.010 --> 01:32.180
Let's see if it works let's look for any term for example.

01:32.180 --> 01:42.330
Laura Ebsen which is the text used in various polls and pages of our site as you can see our search

01:42.330 --> 01:44.840
can already returned some results.

01:44.970 --> 01:51.030
Here we got one two three four

01:55.350 --> 01:57.980
ten search results on this page.

01:57.990 --> 02:03.360
Of course we should have more results but they're not explained in the next lesson.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.380
You'll understand why and also fix this problem.

02:06.450 --> 02:12.200
But if you pay close attention you'll see that the view of this search based it's no acquaintance of

02:12.200 --> 02:13.370
ours isn't it.

02:14.440 --> 02:21.880
Yes the entire structure being repeated here comes from our fallback file index that page B which is

02:21.880 --> 02:28.910
our default template of course we don't want our search results page to look like any other page.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.300
So we have to create a new template for each visit.

02:32.350 --> 02:44.900
Let's go back to our subline text and we wanted to create a new template file called search that BHB.

02:45.070 --> 02:51.370
You remember our theme hierarchy according to it it can create the same place file to handle the search

02:51.370 --> 02:52.090
results.

02:52.270 --> 02:59.290
Instead of using the index file which is our default template file to speed things up a bit we can copy

02:59.290 --> 03:05.080
the contents of the single that page peafowl.

03:05.190 --> 03:11.360
And here we just need to create a new page file that you handle the content of each result item which

03:11.420 --> 03:21.280
will appear inside or look let's call it content hyphen search not BHB First let's make some changes

03:21.280 --> 03:29.320
here inside the loop inside the Get thing play part function that's great create the file

03:33.890 --> 03:36.160
and just pick things up a bit again.

03:36.360 --> 03:42.910
Let's copy the contents of the content e-mail that page peafowl less space everything here.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.560
And let's remove the name call because we don't need some nails here.

03:50.230 --> 03:55.870
And instead of showing the full content of the post let's just show part of the content with the excerpt

03:55.870 --> 03:56.600
function.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.400
Let's make it simple.

03:59.110 --> 04:06.720
Let's refresh our search results page.

04:06.730 --> 04:09.790
Now we have something totally different.

04:09.820 --> 04:13.890
It's in the more simple Now question.

04:13.980 --> 04:17.510
Oh some would find the search box itself after all.

04:17.510 --> 04:19.160
Where is it coming from.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.050
Is it showing up like magic.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.570
No I don't think so.

04:23.960 --> 04:28.760
And what if I want to remove this label here that says search for.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.950
How can I do this.

04:30.260 --> 04:36.540
So in the next lesson you answer for all of those questions and learn to modify our search box a little.

04:36.550 --> 04:38.290
So see you next time.
