Hello guys in the next three lessons you're going to learn the basics about internationalization of

00:07.800 --> 00:09.110
Wordpress themes.

00:09.540 --> 00:16.080
Generally in small projects we should only be used by a single client who don't want their page to be

00:16.080 --> 00:17.860
viewed in several languages.

00:17.890 --> 00:23.740
I don't worry about internationalization But this thing is essentially important.

00:23.880 --> 00:31.020
If you as a developer want to make your thing available for download or if you have a client who makes

00:31.020 --> 00:38.490
his or her site should be translated into other languages it is your task as a developer to at least

00:38.490 --> 00:40.770
make the thing translatable.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.900
That's what I'm going to be teaching you in the next lessons.

00:44.130 --> 00:50.310
Let's learn how to make the theme translatable and easily generated files that will serve as the basis

00:50.310 --> 00:51.780
for translators.

00:52.050 --> 00:58.170
But before we start I wanted to explain a little bit about how the translation flow works on the Wordpress

00:58.170 --> 00:59.140
theme.

00:59.190 --> 01:02.400
First that first translation should be possible.

01:02.420 --> 01:05.280
We first have to use some specific functions.

01:05.370 --> 01:11.700
These functions need to be used every time you have some text in the thing that can be possibly translated

01:11.700 --> 01:13.340
into another language.

01:13.380 --> 01:18.680
For example we have the term surge inside our search box in the Brazilian side.

01:18.810 --> 01:24.330
For example this term will have to be displayed as this Keizer not search.

01:24.570 --> 01:27.930
But for now it's impossible for us to translate this term.

01:27.950 --> 01:32.990
Because if you look at the source code it is hard coded.

01:33.060 --> 01:40.790
For example let's open up the search form that page be file and you can see it here as it is now.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.540
It's impossible to trigger some translation for the store.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.770
The same thing goes for the files.

01:47.790 --> 01:54.560
For example the customized page peafowl there are several strings here that cannot be translated.

01:54.780 --> 02:01.310
At least the way they are at the moment they will remain intact in the language in which they were reading.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.640
In this case they will remain in English.

02:04.860 --> 02:13.530
So this will have to rely on a group of functions which as a whole are known as yet text functions.

02:13.550 --> 02:20.770
There are several functions but in the next lessons I will focus on the two most used in wordpress themes.

02:20.780 --> 02:21.690
OK.

02:22.040 --> 02:29.600
So second step once each term is properly wrapped with the gettext functions you can create a file that

02:29.600 --> 02:35.390
will have to be O.T. extension which stands for portable object template.

02:35.510 --> 02:41.980
This file will contain a list of all translatable strings but we won't have any translation here.

02:42.440 --> 02:47.180
As the name suggests the Briotti file is just a template.

02:47.180 --> 02:55.060
Typically this file sensu translators and from it the translators generate two files one with the Piola

02:55.180 --> 02:59.320
extension and another one with the M O extension.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.810
These two files contain all the translations.

03:02.810 --> 03:08.840
The difference between them is that the file contains text that can be easily read by humans.

03:08.840 --> 03:15.220
On the other hand the emal contains machine code and can only be read by web servers.

03:15.230 --> 03:21.470
My explanation in this license will be limited to the creation of the beautiful and the reason for that

03:21.500 --> 03:22.670
is very simple.

03:22.700 --> 03:27.060
The developer doesn't have to translate the theme itself.

03:27.260 --> 03:35.380
This task is up to the client or to the translators that he or she may hire for your own film collaborators.

03:35.440 --> 03:41.900
If you should have a team many themes and plugins especially the best known ones have the help of several

03:41.900 --> 03:44.260
collaborators worldwide.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.490
As I said this translation task is not yours.

03:48.530 --> 03:55.010
At least that's my opinion but it's your duty to make the film translatable ready to be translated by

03:55.010 --> 03:58.090
others again well in this lesson.

03:58.090 --> 03:59.960
I just wanted to explain this to you.

04:00.160 --> 04:05.230
But in the next lesson you're going to start with the first step that I explained in today's lesson.

04:05.310 --> 04:12.590
That is let's understand which are the to get tax functions I mentioned today and you go ahead and find

04:12.590 --> 04:17.250
this strange snarfing that can be transformed into translatable terms.

04:17.260 --> 04:19.660
So until then peace out guys.
