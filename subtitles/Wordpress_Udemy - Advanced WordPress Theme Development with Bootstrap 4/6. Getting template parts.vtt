00:00.930 --> 00:07.650
Hail Marcello here again in this lesson you're going to learn about a very important function which

00:07.650 --> 00:14.330
will accompany you all the time during your career as a WordPress developer and the name of it is get

00:14.510 --> 00:15.720
play a part.

00:15.710 --> 00:22.790
Function as get straight to the point and open up our index that BHP file.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.650
Anyone who has at least basic knowledge of BHB knows that we use a command called require that you include

00:30.680 --> 00:38.640
files within another file in wordpress we have something similar which is the Gets template part function.

00:38.640 --> 00:45.890
It works much like HP require including template parts inside another template file to exemplify how

00:45.890 --> 00:47.120
this function works.

00:47.150 --> 00:54.950
I'm going to cut out this NL article which repeats itself inside the loop and base its contents inside

00:55.040 --> 00:56.420
another file.

00:56.420 --> 01:03.460
Let's create a folder inside the Sims folder called template hyphen parts here.

01:03.470 --> 01:06.470
Let's create a file called content that BHP

01:09.220 --> 01:12.390
and inside it spaced in the code we cut before

01:16.450 --> 01:24.520
I go back to index that be right now if I write something here in place of that article that content

01:24.580 --> 01:28.400
will repeat according to the number of times the loop runs.

01:28.420 --> 01:38.090
For example let's add a paragraph here and notice that this paragraph will repeat here a few times every

01:38.090 --> 01:44.030
single repetition corresponds to the number of balls found on the database brought to us by the Word

01:44.030 --> 01:45.180
Press loop.

01:45.800 --> 01:52.330
Now if I want to bring the content that it's now inside the new contact page file when it is used to

01:52.330 --> 01:55.090
get stained plate part function.

01:55.280 --> 02:01.580
This is a very useful function will often use it when you develop your Wordpress themes.

02:01.820 --> 02:04.760
So let's call it here instead of the paragraph

02:07.480 --> 02:09.630
Well first how does it work.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.220
This function has two parameters.

02:12.220 --> 02:15.000
The first one is always required.

02:15.190 --> 02:22.270
And the word press Codex has a somewhat complicated explanation for this function but I'll try to make

02:22.270 --> 02:23.670
it simple.

02:23.740 --> 02:30.070
The first parameter we pass is the file name we want to call without the BHB extension.

02:30.220 --> 02:35.880
In our case this will be tinplate hyphen parts for Slash content.

02:35.950 --> 02:41.200
Since our content that file is inside the template parts folder.

02:41.200 --> 02:47.050
Let's suppose that it's not inside any folder then we will just have the word content.

02:47.140 --> 02:47.970
OK.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.480
The second parameter is optional.

02:50.650 --> 02:55.930
We want to use it now but it will be very useful in the next lesson.

02:55.930 --> 03:03.550
When you talk about both formats and save that and now let's go back to our thing

03:07.140 --> 03:11.260
look now the content of the theme is again complete.

03:11.370 --> 03:14.850
But then you might ask me what why do I have to use that.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.920
I didn't see any difference.

03:16.950 --> 03:19.580
The thing didn't get any faster.

03:19.620 --> 03:23.700
Anyway it seems that nothing happened Marcello really.

03:23.700 --> 03:30.340
Apparently nothing happened but we made a way to use several very important programming concepts here.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.530
First do not repeat yourself.

03:33.630 --> 03:40.910
That is don't create lines in more lines of code when you can write much less and get the same result.

03:40.980 --> 03:47.610
Also by doing what we did here we will have a cleaner code one that will be easier to understand by

03:47.610 --> 03:51.720
other developers which is recommended in any WordPress him.

03:51.750 --> 03:58.850
We changed several lines with HCM malcontent and moved to another location leaving the cold shoulder.

03:59.160 --> 04:06.900
Easier to be read well it just scratched the surface of this new function in the next lesson.

04:06.990 --> 04:11.590
We come back and we're going to show an even more practical use for it.

04:11.590 --> 04:13.030
So see you later.
