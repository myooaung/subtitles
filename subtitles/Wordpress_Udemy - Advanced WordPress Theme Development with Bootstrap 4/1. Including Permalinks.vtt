Hello Guys welcome to a new section of our course you're going to start.

00:06.850 --> 00:09.680
Correcting a problem we have in our theme.

00:10.020 --> 00:15.770
If you hover over a post-Idol or an image you'll see that none of them has a link.

00:15.990 --> 00:22.890
So here in the home page for example if you tried to click on any post image or any title you'll not

00:22.890 --> 00:24.800
be able to get anywhere.

00:24.870 --> 00:27.700
That's very sad in today's lesson.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.280
Are you going to solve this problem once and for all.

00:31.420 --> 00:35.390
OK first we've got to figure out where we need to make the changes.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.470
Let's open up the page home that beach be filed.

00:39.750 --> 00:47.700
And here in the file in which you loops as you remember two files have been required and it's within

00:47.700 --> 00:51.530
these files that we can find the post contents.

00:51.540 --> 00:54.780
Let's start with the current and future dot file.

00:56.010 --> 01:03.580
In this file they have a DIV tag for the film now and also a name tag ready post-Idol comes from.

01:03.580 --> 01:11.950
This is where we have to change well to create a link going to use an anchor tag that's created here

01:12.220 --> 01:15.230
within this div tag.

01:15.250 --> 01:21.970
Let's go ahead and cut out all of the content from the featured image and paste that here inside the

01:21.970 --> 01:23.060
anchor tag.

01:23.530 --> 01:26.670
Now here is the secret inside the HGF attribute.

01:26.830 --> 01:34.440
Let's pass a WordPress function called the permalink permalink in wordpress.

01:34.530 --> 01:40.660
Nothing more than your house in which a resource or article will be permanently saved.

01:40.770 --> 01:46.650
To put it simple links are all the links for posts pages etc..

01:46.760 --> 01:49.470
Let's do the same thing now for the H2 tag

01:57.860 --> 02:03.690
and other thing we can do here is place this as to tag below the featured image so that the thing can

02:03.690 --> 02:09.210
be as similar as possible to the initial layout OK.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.080
Now we can say

02:17.200 --> 02:25.060
now as you can see we have the featured news link both here in the picture and here in the title.

02:25.180 --> 02:28.720
It can do the same thing now for the secondary row.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.380
To do this.

02:30.430 --> 02:32.260
Open up the content secondary.

02:32.260 --> 02:37.030
That page file as the content will be the same.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.260
It can copy the changes we made in the other file and paste in here.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.230
NET safe now.

02:51.220 --> 02:55.680
And now we also have the links for the secondary news icons.

02:55.900 --> 03:01.240
See if you click here you can already get somewhere.

03:01.310 --> 03:06.920
I can do the same thing for the posts that are being called on the blog page.

03:07.020 --> 03:14.820
If you visit that page see we don't have links here either for none of the items.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.100
This post here.

03:16.140 --> 03:23.510
I've been called by that loop that they have inside the index that page file and in this loop as you

03:23.510 --> 03:31.540
remember at least I hope you remember we are requiring three content files which are these three here.

03:33.260 --> 03:39.710
As open one by one but this time it's going to be easier because we already know what to do.

03:40.020 --> 03:49.440
So let's go ahead and copy only the modified tag of this file here and a space in each of the files.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.580
Let's do the same for the thumbnails

04:17.290 --> 04:17.790
OK.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.970
Everything saved.

04:19.140 --> 04:21.810
Let's see how the blog page looks like

04:27.680 --> 04:29.420
OK everything's fine.

04:29.530 --> 04:33.350
Now look again the links in all the polls.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.770
Very good.

04:35.770 --> 04:38.550
In the next lesson we will continue on.

04:38.650 --> 04:45.850
Now that we got the links we will learn how to create the single view WordPress template file so see

04:45.940 --> 04:46.250
then.
