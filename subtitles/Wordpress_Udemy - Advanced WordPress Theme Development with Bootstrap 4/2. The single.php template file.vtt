Hello guys we're back for a new lesson today.

00:04.830 --> 00:10.260
You're going to learn what is the single that BHP file and how we can create it.

00:10.420 --> 00:15.310
I hint it's one of the most important thing plate files in wordpress.

00:15.660 --> 00:18.430
Let's start this lesson with a quick recap.

00:18.660 --> 00:24.660
In one of the first lessons of this course I told you that when the page of a WordPress theme opened

00:25.110 --> 00:31.260
a mechanism called the template hierarchy comes into action according to this hierarchy there is a main

00:31.260 --> 00:34.560
template file which is the index that speech file.

00:34.620 --> 00:42.240
Now I think every one of you know that the content of this file is always displayed especially when

00:42.240 --> 00:45.930
WordPress doesn't know which file to load in a given situation.

00:46.170 --> 00:52.590
For example which file will be loaded when someone tries to open a page that doesn't exist in the thing.

00:52.620 --> 00:57.880
Which file would be loaded when someone performs a search for those two moments.

00:57.900 --> 01:02.530
He may have specialized things played fives in the case of a page not found.

01:02.580 --> 01:09.900
We may have a file called for for that BHP which could have inside it I can't say for example Whoops

01:10.080 --> 01:13.080
the page you're visiting doesn't exist.

01:13.130 --> 01:17.460
You want to do a search or return to the home page instead.

01:17.760 --> 01:23.840
But what happens when they don't have a file called for or 4 that page be in our field.

01:24.210 --> 01:31.320
Well what happens is that WordPress doesn't know which file to load and so that the user the site visitor

01:31.620 --> 01:37.340
doesn't come across an empty page or press load in the Excel file instead.

01:37.620 --> 01:42.780
So the index file is what we call a fallback file.

01:42.800 --> 01:50.100
This is what is happening right now in RC when we click on any link that leads to a post.

01:50.210 --> 01:56.540
Since we don't have any specific template file to load what press is loading the index that page be

01:56.540 --> 02:04.900
File for us but the index file cannot be used in any which way because of this we can create a different

02:04.900 --> 02:12.460
thing Pluche file to show a single word press post a unique post and that file will be called single

02:12.530 --> 02:14.690
dot Ph be.

02:14.690 --> 02:16.520
So let's go ahead and create the file

02:22.660 --> 02:25.170
and like everything click File.

02:25.200 --> 02:32.230
Let's start by creating the get header call so get underscore in header

02:34.960 --> 02:40.040
by doing this when they click on a post you'll see that we have our Hetter

02:44.000 --> 02:51.210
and down here that's called the footer.

02:51.230 --> 02:56.410
Now anything we type in here it will be displayed average time click on any link in the post

03:01.660 --> 03:03.880
Ok but that's not what we want.

03:04.090 --> 03:05.080
Why do need great.

03:05.080 --> 03:11.780
Here is a loop that can print out the post contents and this time we'll have a standard WordPress loop.

03:11.810 --> 03:13.990
Ok no custom loops for now.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.760
Before that that's great.

03:16.760 --> 03:25.960
Our H.E. mail markup let's add a DIV tag here with the ID primary and inside it.

03:26.080 --> 03:30.840
Another DIV tag with the ID of main.

03:31.080 --> 03:39.590
Here we are going to create a container so that our content is always centered on the page and the loop

03:39.590 --> 03:48.560
is going to start here the only difference is that we don't need the part that says if I have posts

03:49.070 --> 03:54.010
can you answer why well post this video and try to answer that here.

03:54.050 --> 03:54.940
Yes.

03:54.980 --> 03:57.430
Post this video well.

03:57.460 --> 04:00.370
The answer is pretty obvious.

04:00.520 --> 04:06.900
We are already in the post so we don't need to check for posts right.

04:06.970 --> 04:11.690
If you're already displaying a single post why do you need to check for posts.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.820
It makes no sense at all.

04:13.930 --> 04:21.310
So we start up it a while block while health posts

04:24.840 --> 04:29.330
the post.

04:29.370 --> 04:33.270
Let's close out the while block with enviro.

04:33.390 --> 04:40.170
Now here at this point we can choose to load the full content exactly here or create a new file for

04:40.170 --> 04:47.180
it and then create a new file as called content hyphen single dot page.

04:47.180 --> 04:53.990
Pete and require it to get things like Byard WordPress function

05:01.370 --> 05:02.610
to speed up a bit.

05:02.780 --> 05:06.030
I'm going to place here the contents of this file

05:10.340 --> 05:11.410
from this code.

05:11.420 --> 05:15.480
The only thing you've never seen before is this section here.

05:16.330 --> 05:26.110
I'm using a WordPress function called the ID to display the word post hyphen followed by the ID of each

05:26.110 --> 05:27.120
post.

05:27.130 --> 05:31.900
This can come in handy when we want to style specific post.

05:31.900 --> 05:35.070
In addition we created a header with title.

05:35.140 --> 05:41.530
Notice that the title is the thing and each one tag and since it is the main heading tag of the page

05:42.100 --> 05:43.990
and it doesn't have any links.

05:44.140 --> 05:50.920
Since we don't need the link anymore because we are already inside the post here below have the full

05:50.920 --> 05:53.820
content of the post and that's it.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.050
Let's save this file

05:58.160 --> 06:03.620
and when you open the post link we have a new view for our single post.

06:04.540 --> 06:10.650
As you see we get a totally different look and compare to the view we had before.

06:10.720 --> 06:18.430
For example before we had the Post feature image which came from the index that page before now it don't

06:18.430 --> 06:26.640
have any image and instead of the post excerpt what we have is the full content of the post.

06:26.650 --> 06:34.030
This is now working for all the places where we have links that lead to any WordPress post cause it

06:35.560 --> 06:38.450
but there is still something missing.

06:38.590 --> 06:41.760
What if our visitor wants to comment on our post.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.810
How will he or she do it.

06:43.850 --> 06:47.050
That's what we be learning to do in the next lesson.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.100
I wait for you then by.
