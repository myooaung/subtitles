00:01.330 --> 00:07.960
Hello guys in today's lesson I'm going to explain to you how to install WordPress especially for those

00:07.960 --> 00:10.960
of you who still don't know how to do that.

00:11.530 --> 00:16.960
Unfortunately the information available on the Internet is very vague.

00:16.960 --> 00:23.470
For example the vast majority of tutorials don't explain to you the best practices for installing WordPress

00:23.900 --> 00:26.960
on both your local server and your web server.

00:27.430 --> 00:33.490
So I just listen and going to make a point of explaining what in my opinion are those best practices

00:33.790 --> 00:38.740
things that I always do to install my wordpress in the best possible way.

00:39.350 --> 00:40.930
So let's get started.

00:40.930 --> 00:52.280
The first thing we're going to do is visit the WordPress website which is on WordPress dot o r g.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.180
So let's go ahead and click download Wordpress

00:59.740 --> 01:01.990
and then click this nice blue button here.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.590
Save the file onto my computer.

01:09.120 --> 01:09.960
OK.

01:10.430 --> 01:17.210
This is WordPress for point a point to maybe when you're doing this exercise of installing WordPress

01:17.660 --> 01:22.320
you'll see another version this Wordpress is always releasing updates.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.550
No problem at all.

01:25.230 --> 01:30.110
Let's go ahead and open our finder and look for the file we've just downloaded.

01:33.280 --> 01:42.590
Right click copy this file what you pasted on my local web server folder

01:45.310 --> 01:51.260
in my case this folder is all my documents folder and it's called the docs.

01:51.830 --> 01:53.040
The prince is here.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.760
If I don't know how it changed his name age the dog's directory.

01:57.760 --> 02:02.200
Just take a look at the document I've included on the previous lesson.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.260
That document explains exactly how to do that.

02:05.260 --> 02:11.920
For those of you of course who are interested by the way let's check in for Betty and my Secord servers

02:11.920 --> 02:18.420
are running otherwise which will be impossible to install WordPress are going to do that.

02:18.430 --> 02:24.520
I'll just open my zem control panel manager OS X

02:36.330 --> 02:41.550
number to manage servers and start all servers at once.

02:44.080 --> 02:51.400
Now once you unzip this find side folder that I'm going to create next the name of that for the ruby

02:51.490 --> 02:52.430
W.P..

02:52.510 --> 02:53.430
OK.

02:53.800 --> 03:01.900
But of course yours don't need to have the same name as mine which is another one that I wanted to base

03:01.900 --> 03:03.300
the zip file here.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.400
And unzip it right here.

03:12.660 --> 03:18.130
When it's finished we will eventually come up with a folder called WordPress.

03:18.180 --> 03:20.120
But that's not what we want.

03:20.190 --> 03:20.600
OK.

03:20.610 --> 03:27.930
Since I don't want to install WordPress inside his folder so what I'm going to do jump into my wordpress

03:27.960 --> 03:30.970
folder select everything

03:33.830 --> 03:41.030
copy those files and move everything command option V in the row that this WP folder.

03:41.270 --> 03:48.490
And of course if you are using Windows you have to cut and paste then I'm going to delete this WordPress

03:48.530 --> 03:51.280
folder here since I don't need it any more as well.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.290
And it's now empty.

03:55.130 --> 04:01.860
So this is the default installation of Wordpress and these are the installation files.

04:02.270 --> 04:02.940
OK.

04:03.170 --> 04:07.630
Once we have all the installation files ready I'm going to do now.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.580
Well the first thing I got to do is something that WordPress asked me straight away a database so I

04:16.580 --> 04:20.430
need to create a database for the word resolution to take place.

04:20.480 --> 04:28.550
That's very important and it's actually the great advantage of having a WordPress site rather than just

04:29.090 --> 04:31.220
a simple way to me outside.

04:31.340 --> 04:38.660
You have all this structure created by an entire community a structure on which the word breasting keeps

04:38.660 --> 04:46.070
working to ensure that it has all the security you need to build your website your thing your plug ins

04:46.520 --> 04:51.140
and you'll be using this platform that has been around for years.

04:51.440 --> 05:01.310
So let's go ahead and access our ph be my admin mistyping local host slash ph be my admin and the steps

05:01.310 --> 05:07.330
I'm going to explain can be used for both local server and for a remote web server.

05:07.820 --> 05:14.300
Since all of the steps will not be very different at all unless for a couple of things for example you

05:14.300 --> 05:21.590
have another web address to access your remote web server a different password maybe the name of your

05:21.590 --> 05:25.340
server will change it from the local host.

05:25.340 --> 05:30.090
That is maybe you will receive another server name from your hosting company.

05:30.110 --> 05:34.410
And of course your username and password also be different.

05:34.850 --> 05:43.040
But for the default installation of a local server the user is normally root and the password is empty.

05:44.390 --> 05:52.300
I'll just click on database and choose a name for my database here and the name of it will be W.P. and

05:52.300 --> 05:59.230
the score learn W.P. go ahead and click here to create it.

05:59.420 --> 06:06.020
And you'll notice that the database the new database is now showing here on this site where it's ready

06:06.020 --> 06:15.200
for me to use it and I want to open a new tab on my web browser and I can write the following localhost

06:15.740 --> 06:23.570
slash W.P. which is the folder located on the page the docs directory remember where all the files of

06:23.570 --> 06:26.040
the world press installations are.

06:26.130 --> 06:32.170
I hit enter and wish to open for me the home page of my wordpress installation.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.850
This is a welcome message.

06:37.850 --> 06:44.540
And before we continue on Minnich know in advance the value of the views below the name of the database

06:44.540 --> 06:52.700
we have already created the user name of their database which in our case is root password which is

06:52.700 --> 06:58.450
empty server name which is localhost and the table prefix.

06:58.730 --> 07:05.930
Unfortunately this little detail of that database prefix is what many tutorials on the internet don't

07:05.930 --> 07:07.020
teach at all.

07:07.070 --> 07:11.770
We need to change this prefix when we saw WordPress OK.

07:12.200 --> 07:18.290
This is very important because it's not use have any website inside the Wordpress platform.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.330
However secure it is.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.220
If you don't do your part don't you agree with me.

07:24.230 --> 07:29.930
Our first task them will be to change the prefix of the word press tables.

07:29.930 --> 07:31.140
So let's do it now.

07:31.460 --> 07:32.530
Go ahead and click.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.430
Let's go.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.440
Typing here.

07:35.450 --> 07:37.120
The name of our database

07:42.340 --> 07:46.780
as you know the username of our database is rude.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.360
The password is empty.

07:48.730 --> 07:54.220
And since we are using the local server the name of the database server is local host.

07:54.460 --> 08:00.650
If you are on remote web server check this information first which you're hosting company.

08:00.730 --> 08:08.080
Generally when you sign up for shared hosting services this information is sent to your e-mail and now

08:08.140 --> 08:13.100
you're going to change the database prefix which is very important in terms of security.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.250
As I told you.

08:14.740 --> 08:19.010
But you might be asking why it's so important.

08:19.330 --> 08:28.420
Well because by default what press comes with the pre-sex WP but everyone knows that even the bad guys

08:28.480 --> 08:30.290
even the hackers know that.

08:30.340 --> 08:37.560
So if you keep the prefix as W.P. you certainly lend a hand to sizing Vaders.

08:37.570 --> 08:39.800
So let's change it here.

08:40.660 --> 08:42.540
No it's not WPA anymore.

08:42.540 --> 08:48.930
Let's call it for example W B C or S which is far better than just WB.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.050
You can of course whatever prefix you want.

08:52.150 --> 08:54.790
It doesn't have to be the same as mine.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.810
OK click Submit

09:00.670 --> 09:02.450
click install.

09:02.670 --> 09:10.880
Let's move for the final steps of the installation process about having typing in the name of our website.

09:10.900 --> 09:21.910
It will be anything this learned WB here hearing username I recommend that you don't use names such

09:21.910 --> 09:28.170
as admin W.P. test or some other weaker options.

09:28.210 --> 09:33.390
You can choose for example you'll name a stronger name one that you remember easily OK.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.530
For example.

09:34.610 --> 09:35.560
Is my name.

09:35.770 --> 09:41.380
But again you can use whatever name you want for the password.

09:41.440 --> 09:48.610
I recommend that you accept this password here or choose a very strong password especially in the case

09:48.610 --> 09:54.760
that you are installing WordPress on the remote web server for security reasons of course.

09:54.790 --> 10:01.900
In my case as I am in a local server I would just tighten one two three four five six seven to make

10:01.900 --> 10:07.140
things easier even because it would be just a local installation.

10:07.720 --> 10:15.550
But what is important is that when you work in a production environment inside a remote server you always

10:15.550 --> 10:17.620
change the admin password.

10:17.710 --> 10:21.450
Don't use one two three four five six seven OK.

10:21.550 --> 10:24.410
This is only to make my work easier.

10:24.430 --> 10:28.700
During this course as I've chosen a very weak password.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.090
What you asked me to confirm the use of a weak password.

10:33.490 --> 10:39.810
Here's another email and I can click here to prevent search engines from indexing this site because

10:40.260 --> 10:42.100
I'm just creating the site yet.

10:42.570 --> 10:47.010
So I don't want search engines like Google to index that site.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.280
At least not now.

10:49.710 --> 10:53.090
And finally I went to our press here and we should be good.

10:53.100 --> 10:53.340
You

10:57.380 --> 10:58.670
and here we are.

10:58.970 --> 11:01.740
We're past this just installed.

11:01.910 --> 11:02.860
If I click here.

11:02.890 --> 11:03.750
Log in.

11:03.950 --> 11:07.410
Enter my username and my password.

11:07.650 --> 11:10.170
I will jump into the Wordpress dashboard

11:15.700 --> 11:16.940
by default.

11:17.050 --> 11:24.540
You'll see that if my head over to appearance seems where press comes with some native themes installed

11:25.150 --> 11:28.170
the name of them are always related to the year.

11:28.200 --> 11:37.420
The theme was created so for example 2016 2017 what you're going to learn in this course is to stop

11:37.420 --> 11:40.880
depending on this WordPress native themes.

11:40.930 --> 11:48.440
We will learn to create our own theme and be able to customize it throughout the course and is good.

11:48.860 --> 11:52.090
So that's what I had explained to you in this lesson.

11:52.300 --> 11:57.370
I hope you feel like you learned something new today and I'll be back in the next lesson.

11:57.370 --> 12:01.960
We all began to understand how we were preserving works on the inside.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.790
So I see you in the next lesson.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.610
Until then unhappy coding.
