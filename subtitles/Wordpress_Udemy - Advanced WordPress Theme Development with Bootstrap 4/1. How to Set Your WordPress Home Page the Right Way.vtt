00:00.700 --> 00:06.730
Hey guys in today's video I want to start a new experience an experience that I believe would be useful

00:06.730 --> 00:12.520
both for students already enrolled in my wordpress theme development courses as well as for those who

00:12.520 --> 00:14.260
don't know the courses yet.

00:14.410 --> 00:18.680
I'm gonna start answering the most interesting questions my students sent me.

00:18.910 --> 00:25.300
This will help complement what students already learn in the courses and to also be very useful for

00:25.300 --> 00:30.620
those who don't know my material yet I won't be answering all the questions on video.

00:30.700 --> 00:34.380
Only the most interesting or the most frequent ones.

00:34.480 --> 00:39.220
I think this will help a lot of people both inside and outside my courses.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.110
So let's go.

00:41.110 --> 00:44.950
I'll start by answering a question that I get a lot.

00:44.950 --> 00:51.080
One of the questions comes from the Udemy forum which is one of the platforms on which I teach.

00:51.250 --> 00:54.130
This one for example is from student Jamil.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.620
Sorry for the pronunciation.

00:56.710 --> 01:04.340
He asked me Does home page that page be replaced page home that BHP in the newer version of WordPress.

01:04.420 --> 01:05.990
Aren't they the same thing.

01:05.990 --> 01:09.160
And there are all the similar questions in the forum.

01:09.160 --> 01:14.210
Well this is a very common question especially for those who are starting to learn how to create a theme

01:14.210 --> 01:15.630
in WordPress.

01:15.640 --> 01:23.440
People always struggle to understand how lot these template files work why they exist etc. have a file

01:23.440 --> 01:29.950
called home that page B and other one called Front Page doc page pay have the page that page be indexed

01:29.950 --> 01:36.400
on page B and you also have other possibilities and this makes developers very confused especially those

01:36.400 --> 01:43.780
who are most used to creating page say simpler only using a gem LCROSS and pure PSP.

01:43.810 --> 01:47.490
I myself had a hard time trying to understand this at first.

01:47.740 --> 01:53.260
I only managed to understand WordPress the third time I sat down to learn it but I'll show you that

01:53.260 --> 01:54.580
the logic is easy.

01:55.270 --> 01:59.720
Well deep down all these questions are about the same subject.

01:59.830 --> 02:03.630
How do you determine the of a home page in WordPress.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.100
Here's where things get tricky.

02:06.100 --> 02:11.820
There are many ways to do there and that's what I find most interesting about WordPress.

02:11.830 --> 02:17.180
There are a lot of possibilities for almost everything to help understand this subject.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.710
I've separated here.

02:18.880 --> 02:25.690
The theme I featured beauty in my theme development course this is the home page of the theme already

02:25.690 --> 02:30.920
finished here I have the header a slide show.

02:31.520 --> 02:38.230
These sections a list of posts from the blog a map and on the themes footer

02:41.050 --> 02:47.480
and here I have the admin of my wordpress installation so how do I define what will appear in my wordpress

02:47.480 --> 02:48.050
home page.

02:48.800 --> 02:55.160
Well there are several ways you can choose any of them but basically what controls it is a wordpress

02:55.160 --> 03:03.820
setup that is here under Settings Reading here under your home page displays WordPress allows you to

03:03.820 --> 03:06.490
configure the home page in two ways.

03:06.490 --> 03:15.240
First display your latest posts or display a static page and here in the second option you have the

03:15.240 --> 03:21.060
possibility to choose between two types of static pages one that will serve as the basis for the home

03:21.060 --> 03:25.160
page of the site and another one for The Post's page.

03:25.230 --> 03:32.070
The site's blog by the way for those who don't know what a static page is let's say in a very brief

03:32.070 --> 03:36.130
way that those are the pages you create using the pages menu.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.780
Add new so everything here is a static page.

03:40.890 --> 03:47.400
Right so here we can choose one of the pages to be used as the home page and another for The Post's

03:47.400 --> 03:47.750
page.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.990
Okay.

03:49.440 --> 03:56.220
In my case on my sites are always create a blank page called home and they open up this page for you

03:56.220 --> 03:56.820
to see it.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.020
So there you see it.

04:03.020 --> 04:03.860
It's a blank page.

04:03.870 --> 04:06.700
Okay all right.

04:06.700 --> 04:15.310
Going back here and here for the Post page I choose a page called blog which is also blank.

04:16.350 --> 04:19.340
Okay with that in mind let's play a little with this.

04:19.350 --> 04:20.670
Options here.

04:20.670 --> 04:24.540
What happens when I say I want the home page to show my latest posts.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.080
Let's see it.

04:29.610 --> 04:32.830
So refresh in the home page.

04:32.850 --> 04:35.820
Well now we have a very different look.

04:35.820 --> 04:39.590
Basically the home page became a list of posts.

04:41.130 --> 04:42.830
Why does that happen.

04:43.080 --> 04:49.110
And how those WordPress decide what will appear on the home page to help us understand this.

04:49.170 --> 04:53.630
I'm gonna install a very useful plugin called show current template.

04:53.850 --> 05:00.330
What is plugin does is it points out on the front end which template files are being used to create

05:00.450 --> 05:02.880
the look of some wordpress theme page.

05:02.880 --> 05:03.650
So let's do that

05:12.360 --> 05:15.240
now refresh on the home page.

05:15.420 --> 05:21.210
The plugin indicates here that the index of P2P file is the maintain free file that is being used to

05:21.210 --> 05:22.620
design this page.

05:22.620 --> 05:27.000
But how does WordPress know it has to load these indexed P2P.

05:27.130 --> 05:33.360
And another question at the beginning of this video I said that there are all the files that cause confusion

05:33.360 --> 05:34.600
in people's heads.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.170
The home page that will be the front page that BGP page that BHP and so on.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.100
What are these are the files for.

05:42.360 --> 05:48.150
And why did WordPress choose index top BJP over these other files.

05:48.150 --> 05:52.680
Well this has to do with a little thing called template hierarchy.

05:52.680 --> 05:59.610
This is nothing more than the internal order that WordPress tablets use to load any file in any moment

05:59.610 --> 06:01.840
of execution of any page.

06:01.920 --> 06:07.990
When I tell WordPress that the whole page shows the latest posts the loading order is as follows.

06:08.130 --> 06:16.260
First among the theme files WordPress looks for a file called front hyphen page that page me if it doesn't

06:16.260 --> 06:23.810
exist it looks for one called home that BHP finally if none of these exist.

06:23.930 --> 06:28.610
Less option is to call a file named index not BHP.

06:28.650 --> 06:35.850
Look how interesting in a common light shemale page the index is the main file but in WordPress we say

06:35.850 --> 06:42.100
that it's a fallback file is not the main option say but it's an important file.

06:42.210 --> 06:47.840
That's why it's wrong to create a wordpress thing without ending the Xstrata BHP file.

06:47.850 --> 06:51.570
WordPress will always need this file at some point.

06:51.570 --> 06:57.860
Well let's say this hierarchy working in practice as you've noticed the file being loaded here is indexed

06:57.860 --> 06:58.990
at BJP.

06:59.070 --> 07:03.290
It means that WordPress couldn't find any of the other files to load.

07:03.390 --> 07:06.030
That's because they don't exist in my field.

07:06.360 --> 07:12.920
If I opened the thing files here in my editor you realise that I don't have a file called Front hyphen

07:13.100 --> 07:20.490
page that BHP which will be the first one on the list in the hierarchy and neither home that BHP which

07:20.530 --> 07:25.920
is the second one on the list but I do have these indexed page me.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.640
So let's do the following.

07:27.710 --> 07:30.860
Let's create a file called home that BHP here.

07:30.860 --> 07:38.110
So we're going to start from the opposite order of the hierarchy and I'll be writing anything in here.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.650
Now we load the page.

07:42.820 --> 07:43.760
Have a look.

07:43.870 --> 07:46.570
Now the one controlling the page is home.

07:46.570 --> 07:54.770
That's BHP however if there is a file called Front hyphen page that BHP as it is the highest in the

07:54.770 --> 07:57.590
hierarchy it will control the page instead.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.280
So I see it

08:06.770 --> 08:08.680
look at that.

08:08.780 --> 08:13.940
The interesting thing is that now for example I can create the whole structure of the file that will

08:13.940 --> 08:16.010
control the page look.

08:16.040 --> 08:20.240
For example let me paste the contents of the index not BHP in here

08:30.230 --> 08:34.870
to get it the front page that BHP is now in charge.

08:35.120 --> 08:42.620
And what defines everything that will appear on the page is the file content in this case we get some

08:42.620 --> 08:55.270
function calls a loop a bit of HMO OK with that in mind let's go back to the reading settings and I'll

08:55.270 --> 09:02.250
choose the static pages I want to be displayed on the home page and also delete the files I have created

09:02.290 --> 09:02.760
earn your

09:16.110 --> 09:23.040
well know what defines the look of the page is a file from my theme called page hyphen home that page

09:23.040 --> 09:30.430
B what is the order followed by WordPress here here it depends on whether or not you've selected an

09:30.430 --> 09:34.610
item because uh you can select only one of them if you want.

09:34.760 --> 09:35.080
Right.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.610
It just can't do it like this.

09:38.610 --> 09:44.820
If you live them on selected WordPress automatically returns to the previous default option above.

09:45.420 --> 09:49.480
So if you save it now see it.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.840
Now this one here is selected.

09:52.120 --> 09:59.050
If you select a static page to use as your home page the order to follow is this first WordPress looks

09:59.050 --> 10:03.300
for the front page that BHP file if it doesn't exist.

10:03.330 --> 10:11.100
It looks for a file that starts with Page hyphen followed by this look of the chosen static page.

10:11.190 --> 10:15.270
Later I'll explain this more clearly if it doesn't exist.

10:15.270 --> 10:18.740
It looks for a file called page doc page B.

10:19.050 --> 10:23.830
And lastly if none is found it leaves the index doc page me.

10:24.190 --> 10:29.970
Well with the practical example used before you must have already understood how this order works.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.500
So I won't be creating the files again.

10:32.610 --> 10:37.980
I could have chosen any of these options in my case what I'd like to do is choose the second option

10:38.220 --> 10:45.330
which is to create a file called page hyphen followed by this log of the static page I choose here.

10:45.450 --> 10:47.280
It works like this.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.190
Let's suppose I went to the home page should be this this home page here.

10:51.330 --> 10:56.370
So I create a file called page hyphen home that page B.

10:56.370 --> 10:58.740
That's because if I look at the page table

11:02.190 --> 11:04.890
the base load is home.

11:04.960 --> 11:13.300
For example if I had chosen the contact page the file would have to be called page hyphen contact that

11:13.300 --> 11:20.770
BHP write if I check the page home that BHP file.

11:20.800 --> 11:21.970
This is where a call.

11:22.060 --> 11:30.590
Everything I get on the home page the header the slide show the service section the loops that create

11:30.590 --> 11:34.800
a post list and everything else I have on the page.

11:34.900 --> 11:42.040
Well then you could ask me but what if I want to add content to the home page which now is just a blank

11:42.040 --> 11:45.710
page just to display this content on the home page.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.150
I don't want to depend on writing code.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.620
I want to create content visually.

11:50.620 --> 11:51.670
Well my answer is that.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.750
Then you don't have to do everything I've done here.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.700
Just a very simple loop will do.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.190
For example let me simplify this file's content.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.620
I'm gonna live only a very basic loop here.

12:21.640 --> 12:27.790
Now I can call the content that is inside the editor and to show up on the home page

12:31.670 --> 12:32.800
got it.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.620
That's how for example you're going to work with a page builder plugin.

12:37.130 --> 12:41.500
Let's suppose you want to install a Elementary to design a home page.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.810
You just need something like that code.

12:43.850 --> 12:44.570
All right.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.970
I've already tested and it works

12:50.240 --> 12:52.860
now to wrap up post page.

12:53.230 --> 13:01.580
The loading order here is we get first the home page file if it doesn't exist the index that BHP file

13:01.670 --> 13:02.980
is loaded.

13:03.170 --> 13:07.670
In my case my index and BHP file is always reserved to show the blog page

13:11.750 --> 13:16.300
index that BHP is what WordPress also calls the default template.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.280
You can see this.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.640
If I open one of the pages for editing so let's go

13:24.970 --> 13:33.650
here on the page attributes template this default template here means index the BJP.

13:33.940 --> 13:40.340
Did you know is now you know it you can create all the templates if you want including the templates

13:40.360 --> 13:42.130
to be controlling the home page if you want.

13:42.760 --> 13:48.190
If you're watching this video inside my course you can take a look at one of the lectures at the beginning

13:48.190 --> 13:53.260
of section number three in we should talk about how to use paste templates.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.340
So that's it.

13:54.460 --> 13:58.600
And that's all for today I hope you enjoy the explanation.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.380
See you next time.
