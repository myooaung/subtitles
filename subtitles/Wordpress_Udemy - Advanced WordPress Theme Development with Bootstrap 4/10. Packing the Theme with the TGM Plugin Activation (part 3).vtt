Everyone you are back to the last lesson about DGM plug in activation in this lesson.

00:08.110 --> 00:12.330
You're going to test out the changes been made in the last two lessons.

00:12.340 --> 00:18.070
Let's see if the library actually works as expected in others just as this out.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.560
We need a new installation of wordpress.

00:20.760 --> 00:21.550
Really.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.440
But why.

00:22.840 --> 00:28.040
Well the fact is that we need to simulate a very specific scenario.

00:28.170 --> 00:34.840
We need to make believe a user a customer for example is installing our thing in a brand new WordPress

00:34.860 --> 00:35.550
website.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.830
We cannot do this in the installation.

00:37.840 --> 00:44.650
We are working on since it's already news with all the plugins installed and on top of that the theme

00:44.650 --> 00:46.950
is rad installed and activated.

00:47.350 --> 00:51.030
So that's why we need a brand new instance of wordpress.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.160
So for this lesson I have installed WordPress in a new folder.

00:56.260 --> 01:01.930
It's not a big deal just to name the installation of Wordpress that installed in a new folder called

01:02.050 --> 01:04.200
test.

01:04.200 --> 01:08.430
Another thing I did was to zip my folder to do that.

01:08.600 --> 01:18.780
I just entered WP content seems and that did learn WP folder to a zip file it is all you need to do

01:20.650 --> 01:21.200
OK.

01:21.230 --> 01:26.750
I'm logged in now on the new website and I'm going to install the theme here.

01:26.770 --> 01:33.270
I'll go ahead and head over to appearance themes and upload the compressed theme file

01:46.380 --> 01:46.810
OK.

01:46.810 --> 01:49.300
The film was successfully installed.

01:49.310 --> 01:56.090
Now I can click here and activate it and watch what happens when I do this like it is.

01:56.450 --> 02:02.240
Now I have this warning shown here on the screen and it's saying that we have a list of plugins that

02:02.240 --> 02:08.450
require the installation which are in fact those plugins we have included in the TGM plugin activation

02:08.450 --> 02:09.840
file remember.

02:10.340 --> 02:16.660
I'm going to click here on begin installing plug in and the TGM plugin activation engine.

02:16.810 --> 02:23.090
You show me a table with all the planes that are necessary to the thing and I can check all the items

02:23.090 --> 02:26.450
in the table at once and do a batch install.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.620
That's what I'm going to do now.

02:39.100 --> 02:43.620
Now I can return to the plugin list and also activate them all at once.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.080
So let's go ahead and activate them here.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.360
OK ready.

02:54.620 --> 02:59.730
Now the table is empty and you no longer have any plugins to install.

02:59.750 --> 03:06.440
I can click here and go back to the dashboard and you'll notice now that we have the menu links for

03:06.440 --> 03:09.040
all the plugins we need in the theme.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.750
Of course if you look at the front end now

03:15.780 --> 03:19.370
you see that it still seems quite incomplete.

03:19.470 --> 03:27.090
Listen to me now it's your task as a developer to write all the documentation and teach your user how

03:27.090 --> 03:28.630
to play with your feet.

03:28.860 --> 03:35.840
You need to teach the users to add the menus to set the themes home page and of course just set unnecessary

03:35.940 --> 03:42.100
plugins to make your film work or at least provide the user with some source of information about it.

03:42.160 --> 03:47.030
Some thing developers prefer to offer documentation as video tutorials.

03:50.870 --> 03:58.350
Other developers use other options like to get book for example.

03:58.480 --> 04:04.930
You say also that some plugins allow you to export the data saved in the database to access mail files.

04:04.930 --> 04:10.540
If it's the case of your plugin it can offer an example file with the initial settings of the plugging

04:10.630 --> 04:12.580
along with your files.

04:13.030 --> 04:15.910
Well that's what we have for this lesson.

04:15.910 --> 04:21.520
I hope you have enjoyed it and I hope you feel like you learned something new in these lessons and you

04:21.520 --> 04:28.930
can use this new knowledge in your next projects so see in the next lesson you'll be finally the last

04:28.930 --> 04:32.060
one on this course until then.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.190
Happy Kaupthing.
