00:00.760 --> 00:01.830
Hey what's up.

00:01.900 --> 00:05.070
Picking up where we left off in the last lesson today.

00:05.110 --> 00:11.110
We'll see how to correct that little problem they got when he tried to set a wide and full alignment

00:11.110 --> 00:13.020
for the video blocks.

00:13.020 --> 00:19.570
As you remember our video that was supposed to spend the entire width of the screen simply can't do

00:19.570 --> 00:20.290
that.

00:20.290 --> 00:23.260
To solve this you'll need some additional work.

00:23.260 --> 00:28.880
This idea was taken from a theme that is already available in the Wordpress repository.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.930
One of the feel good and ready themes there.

00:32.140 --> 00:34.180
The theme is called Atomic blocks.

00:34.180 --> 00:41.470
This one here and they solved the video problem using a very simple solution called Fit that's for us

00:41.470 --> 00:44.860
to implement the solution is indeed very easy.

00:44.860 --> 00:49.940
First let's go to the Web site of the project that's FIT vits.

00:50.050 --> 00:50.610
Yes.

00:50.660 --> 00:57.980
That come.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.400
Click here to download

01:05.990 --> 01:11.580
and all I need from here is a copy of this file a query that fits this.

01:12.860 --> 01:14.060
Just pick things up.

01:14.060 --> 01:16.490
I'm going to copy all this code here.

01:22.100 --> 01:30.330
Create a new folder inside our learned W.P. directory create a new file inside this Julias folder.

01:30.370 --> 01:31.110
Other thing

01:35.980 --> 01:38.920
I'm going to say with whatever name I want.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.470
For example it fits that.

01:42.500 --> 01:46.240
Yes of course it needs to have the.

01:46.310 --> 01:47.270
Yes the extension

01:50.250 --> 01:53.560
now have only two important things to do.

01:53.730 --> 01:54.530
First let's see.

01:54.530 --> 02:01.110
Q. This new file at stake advantage of dysfunction that we already have here in the functions that Peachi

02:01.140 --> 02:02.100
file.

02:02.490 --> 02:07.350
And once again call the W.P. and Qs script function inside of it.

02:08.580 --> 02:18.780
The first parameter the file handle pass it as an identifier for the file then type the path to the

02:18.780 --> 02:26.780
file and first is get same play directory your right function and concatenate it with the folder and

02:26.780 --> 02:35.300
the file.

02:35.310 --> 02:39.640
Don't forget this training last before the name of the father of the file.

02:39.640 --> 02:47.130
OK the third parameter is important because we need to pass Shakeri as a dependency to this fire here.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.590
Fortunately WordPress already comes with a curry.

02:50.610 --> 02:55.410
As you know so we just pass an array setting Jake vary as the value

03:02.320 --> 03:05.210
for the version I want pass anything just type here.

03:05.250 --> 03:12.880
No and I'm going to tell WordPress that I want a link with the script at the bottom of the page.

03:13.030 --> 03:21.240
Very simple just add true here as the last parameter and now the second thing you need to do is to call

03:21.240 --> 03:22.440
the script.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.080
Let's go back to the get page

03:31.780 --> 03:35.070
and we're going to copy this code snippet here only.

03:39.090 --> 03:42.090
Now it's up to you where you want to use it.

03:42.090 --> 03:46.620
You can do the same thing I did here and paste this code inside a separate file.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.440
Or paste it right here in our foot.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.060
That's peach peafowl.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.190
This is what I'm going to do.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.380
Let's open up the folder that speech file here.

03:57.470 --> 04:04.880
And right at the end before the barring closing tag I'm going to paste the code that we just copied.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.890
But I only need to make some changes here.

04:09.520 --> 04:16.360
First I'm going to use an alternative syntax for the document RADICH portion if I live that way it would

04:16.360 --> 04:18.070
conflict with wordpress.

04:18.130 --> 04:27.540
So I'm going to replace the allies with J.A.G. and move your lies inside the princes of the anonymous

04:27.540 --> 04:28.530
function.

04:29.790 --> 04:35.880
Another thing I need to do is to define which element will be the target for the script.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.390
Let's go back to the front end.

04:41.290 --> 04:42.720
Inspect the video element

04:50.640 --> 04:53.030
and they got these classes here.

04:53.130 --> 05:02.070
I suggest we use this type video class because you always present regardless of what kind of media you

05:02.070 --> 05:03.580
have here.

05:03.740 --> 05:08.560
If we work for a niche video meal then emotion itself or

05:12.140 --> 05:13.520
especially close here then

05:16.890 --> 05:22.460
say and we want reload the front page to see if it works.

05:29.960 --> 05:38.460
And look now the video has the right size look much better than the gonna test directly here.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.740
Besen the A-line wide class

05:51.120 --> 05:58.200
and it's working to look the result is very very good.

05:58.260 --> 06:02.600
So it's very kin and I hope you enjoyed and I'll wait for you.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.860
Then in the next lesson by.
