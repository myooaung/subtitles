Hello guys in the last lesson we started learning how to create our first WordPress loop.

00:07.160 --> 00:13.780
We learned what love is and what are the advantages of using it within WordPress themes.

00:13.940 --> 00:20.270
The WordPress loop was responsible for creating this section here which shows one of your posts and

00:20.360 --> 00:26.310
actually this is a page and also this post on the blog page.

00:26.540 --> 00:32.270
In this lesson you're going to learn how to make some pages look different things not all of the pages

00:32.270 --> 00:35.980
on the site will be created equal.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.760
So just a quick recap.

00:37.860 --> 00:43.500
In the last lesson month we had a problem yet to be solved on a visit home page for example.

00:43.500 --> 00:48.070
We see that it brings us a static page showing empty categories.

00:48.210 --> 00:55.400
The same thing happens on the About Us page and on the Contact page.

00:55.630 --> 00:58.270
But we want things to look different.

00:58.270 --> 01:01.650
The home page is going to be very different from the other pages.

01:01.660 --> 01:10.960
It's going to have a sidebar and U.S. services slide a map on the other hand the about a space is not

01:10.960 --> 01:12.980
going to have any of that.

01:13.120 --> 01:17.120
There will be no side bar no slide No.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.080
But how are you going to do that.

01:19.330 --> 01:25.050
Well we have to bring to you a new concept called template pages.

01:25.130 --> 01:28.510
There are two ways you can create such template pages.

01:28.550 --> 01:33.040
One of them is creating new page B files with the name of our business.

01:33.080 --> 01:39.200
For example if I want to create a specific page just to load the About Us page so that it looks totally

01:39.200 --> 01:45.020
different from the other pages I would have to create a specific file just for the About Us page.

01:45.020 --> 01:51.820
The same goes for the contact page and for our home page as I'm going to show you now.

01:52.510 --> 01:58.390
The home page is showing content created in the administration come coming from a static page called

01:58.390 --> 02:01.460
home but it must be different.

02:01.900 --> 02:09.560
As I go over to our Sublime Text and we want to create inside the theme folder and you file let's save

02:09.570 --> 02:11.200
it.

02:11.600 --> 02:21.140
And here is the magic the name of this file needs to be paid each hyphen and this lug of the base to

02:21.140 --> 02:23.250
which this file refers to.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.660
If you're wondering where you can find that slug.

02:26.990 --> 02:34.110
I'm going to show you right now so you can find it when you edit the page right here.

02:34.550 --> 02:38.210
The only exception is the base that should be the home page.

02:38.210 --> 02:42.530
You can see it's like here but this love is home.

02:43.860 --> 02:52.290
So for the home page this name is going to be page hyphen home page B if it weren't for the About Us

02:52.290 --> 03:02.340
page to the page hyphen about hyphen us that page B sings about hyphen us.

03:02.340 --> 03:05.320
Is this like for the About Us page.

03:05.340 --> 03:12.780
What we want should be show on this home page well to make this faster let's copy the contents of the

03:12.780 --> 03:16.230
index that page B file the new file.

03:16.250 --> 03:20.660
We still have a culture to get head function to get for that function.

03:20.870 --> 03:29.490
And in the middle a dynamic area that's go ahead so I can copy everything space everything here.

03:31.180 --> 03:37.200
And just for you to notice the difference you're going to delete that too and create a paragraph in

03:37.200 --> 03:38.140
its place.

03:41.860 --> 03:44.950
I'd say and reload the page

03:50.060 --> 03:54.520
look see that these pages are very different from the others.

03:54.530 --> 04:03.050
This is a page created used in a specific file called Page hyphen home that page B This page will have

04:03.050 --> 04:06.160
a logo services Ciber.

04:06.540 --> 04:11.680
Matt Kopp right the way is defined in our initial layouts remember.

04:12.020 --> 04:14.670
But what about the about us page.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.590
What can we do to create it.

04:16.880 --> 04:22.820
We can use the same strategy or just start that is creating a file with the page name in it the same

04:22.820 --> 04:27.560
at the page hyphen about a hyphen us that page B.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.210
So let's create this file.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.700
It's copy the same content from the index page peafowl

04:41.660 --> 04:43.750
and should make this page look different.

04:43.760 --> 04:49.350
We want to delete the div tags and sections we don't want on this page.

04:49.420 --> 04:56.590
I selected this content.

04:56.670 --> 05:02.730
Now when you refresh the page you'll see that it will be totally different.

05:02.740 --> 05:07.630
Now the About Us page as well as the home and blog pages are different.

05:08.500 --> 05:14.310
Another way to the same thing we just did is to create a template page file.

05:14.410 --> 05:20.560
The difference between creating a template file and the file with the page name for example page about

05:20.560 --> 05:22.580
is page home etc..

05:22.750 --> 05:30.430
Is that template pages can be used as often as we want for whatever pages we want.

05:30.430 --> 05:36.910
For example I could create a page template that could serve at the same time for both the About Us page

05:37.000 --> 05:39.250
and for the content page.

05:39.250 --> 05:43.890
In doing so these two pages would have an identical structure.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.020
I'm not saying that the content will be the same.

05:47.080 --> 05:54.820
Many people struggle to understand that the content won't be the same but the positioning of the elements

05:54.820 --> 05:57.460
for example will be the same.

05:57.490 --> 06:05.170
For example if a page has a left sidebar the other page will also have a left sidebar but the content

06:05.170 --> 06:08.340
of those sidebars can be totally different.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.080
When you see a concrete example of this.

06:11.080 --> 06:17.980
But in the next lesson for now as an exercise you can go ahead and try to create a pitch be template

06:17.980 --> 06:20.120
page for the contact page.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.370
You think you can do that I think.

06:22.380 --> 06:25.290
So think of this only as an exercise.

06:25.290 --> 06:25.760
OK.

06:25.870 --> 06:31.180
Seems to be adopting another strategy to create both the contacts and the About Us page.

06:31.210 --> 06:32.760
In our next lesson.

06:33.070 --> 06:35.080
So once you then have become the.
