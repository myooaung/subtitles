00:00.660 --> 00:01.350
Hey guys.

00:01.350 --> 00:03.950
Marcello here with you for another lesson.

00:04.170 --> 00:10.010
And today we'll continue on our overview on how to get your film ready for Gutenberg.

00:10.020 --> 00:17.100
This new content creation experience in WordPress in today's lesson will start making some changes to

00:17.100 --> 00:18.570
our think files.

00:18.570 --> 00:24.540
You begin to understand the connections between your theme and Gutenberg and what you need to do if

00:24.540 --> 00:28.340
you want your thing to get the most out of the new editor.

00:28.350 --> 00:34.760
So let's begin the first cool thing we're going to do today is to enable a new Gutenberg future.

00:34.800 --> 00:41.490
This future is called Wide images and allows you to add two more types of image alignments to some of

00:41.490 --> 00:42.570
the blocks.

00:42.570 --> 00:45.440
Not all of them but some important ones.

00:45.570 --> 00:53.280
And those two alignments are called respectively a line wide and a line foo for which you have a visual

00:53.280 --> 00:55.250
idea of what I'm talking about.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.800
We're going to grab a test wordpress installation.

00:57.840 --> 01:04.500
This is not the one we'll be working with today and I'll be showing these little details in practice.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.690
So here we get an image block.

01:07.860 --> 01:16.530
If I click this block you see here that besides the screen more common alignments I have two more if

01:16.530 --> 01:24.060
I choose here the first one that says white with you see that the image becomes a little bigger so it

01:24.090 --> 01:28.410
overrides the size of the main container they see.

01:28.440 --> 01:36.270
Now if I click the other button for with you see that image expands to the end of the page.

01:36.270 --> 01:43.710
Well this very cool feature can currently be applied to nine block types you see on the screen the name

01:43.710 --> 01:49.260
of all of the blocks that at the moment accept wide and full alignment.

01:49.260 --> 01:55.530
Possibly that number will increase the time and it may also be the case that some block generated by

01:55.530 --> 01:58.230
some plugging as it can make use of them.

01:58.650 --> 02:06.270
Anyway it makes no sense at all for me to show a list here because it will surely be outdated.

02:06.270 --> 02:12.000
Now I said earlier that we need to add support for this future if I want to use it.

02:12.060 --> 02:14.730
In fact it's an opt in feature.

02:14.730 --> 02:17.250
That's where your film comes in.

02:17.250 --> 02:23.600
Do you remember that ad theme support function that we used extensively in the course.

02:23.610 --> 02:29.970
Well now that you have those wide images enabled as well as other more advanced futures in Gutenberg

02:30.330 --> 02:36.600
your film has to add support first for this as go ahead and open up the functions that BHP file

02:44.440 --> 02:50.580
and here inside the function learn WP comfy here at the end of it.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.150
We're going to add another support

02:56.210 --> 03:09.890
so and theme support and we want your passive kind of support called a line hyphen wide let's say this

03:09.890 --> 03:13.970
now and reload the editor.

03:14.150 --> 03:20.180
Let's go back to the previous page and close this one here because this is just the test.

03:20.180 --> 03:23.300
We have a lot of work to do today with this theme here

03:27.660 --> 03:36.580
and here in the gallery block Look we already get the Chou alignment buttons if we click them look they

03:36.580 --> 03:40.810
can already change the appearance of the gallery here in the editor.

03:40.810 --> 03:44.200
However if I tried to preview the changes I made look

03:48.500 --> 03:50.640
where are all the changes.

03:50.810 --> 03:51.680
I just can't see them.

03:52.680 --> 03:59.140
So that means there's something which you have to do if we inspect this image gallery block we see that.

03:59.840 --> 04:07.250
What happens here is that WordPress automatically as here in the well element a couple of CSX classes

04:08.780 --> 04:14.390
some of them such as these WP Block Gallery already implemented by default.

04:14.660 --> 04:17.390
If you take a closer look you see that.

04:17.750 --> 04:18.510
Most of this.

04:18.530 --> 04:24.120
Says for the blocks are already implemented within this file here.

04:24.140 --> 04:28.710
That's why most native blocks word out of the box as I mentioned before.

04:28.910 --> 04:34.130
In this case as you see here they're coming from the Gutenberg plugin folder.

04:34.130 --> 04:36.530
I believe they're after a wordpress 5.0.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.350
They'll come from somewhere else.

04:39.350 --> 04:46.190
So that's the case for all of the native futures but those are the more advanced futures the ones that

04:46.190 --> 04:53.330
you need to add support you they always require you to add extra CSX in your theme so they can work

04:53.780 --> 04:57.720
at least for now maybe in the future that will change.

04:57.770 --> 04:58.920
Who knows.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.520
But the good news is that a lot of people have been working to implement this and I found some good

05:04.520 --> 05:10.940
examples of themes and tutorials about the subject in short all they need to do is to add this.

05:10.940 --> 05:11.210
Yes.

05:11.210 --> 05:19.400
As for those two classes line wide and a line flew in our films yes file so let's go ahead open file

05:19.970 --> 05:31.210
issues here inside the themes folder learn W.P. CSX template that you and hear below.

05:31.210 --> 05:36.850
I'm gonna pace this SS just to speed things up a bit and I'll be explaining to you what's going on here

05:38.850 --> 05:45.420
first we need to make sure that this code here will only be applied when the viewport is at least 11

05:45.420 --> 05:46.830
40 pixels.

05:47.010 --> 05:54.210
Eleven 40 pixels is the width size of the container class of our theme.

05:54.300 --> 06:00.370
You can go on and said also another other values here later and see which makes more sense to you.

06:00.370 --> 06:04.770
Okay here for the two classes we set a margin button.

06:05.220 --> 06:06.680
So nothing special here.

06:07.660 --> 06:13.650
Now to center each of the two classes there is a handful of different solutions.

06:14.020 --> 06:21.000
Some developers prefer to use negative margins for example but I prefer the solution here which use

06:21.000 --> 06:24.070
a C assistance forms just center content.

06:24.250 --> 06:31.420
With that it's enough that for each class you set the width relative to the viewport isn't the VW unit

06:32.380 --> 06:33.790
for the wide alignment.

06:33.790 --> 06:42.400
I set a value of seventy five VW which will correspond to 75 percent of the rendering area of the screen

06:42.700 --> 06:50.040
which we call viewport and for the full with the value is 100 VW of course 100 percent

06:54.410 --> 06:55.520
this an update.

06:55.520 --> 07:00.840
Some students have been complaining that this USS Cole I indicate here is not working in longer.

07:00.860 --> 07:07.220
However according to the tests I did the code still works perfectly but just in case I'm leaving here

07:07.580 --> 07:09.110
an alternative solution.

07:09.290 --> 07:13.550
You can see it on the screen in case the first solution doesn't work for you.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.880
Pause the video and use this other solution.

07:15.890 --> 07:16.120
Okay

07:19.300 --> 07:28.570
all get safe and do some testing just reload the page.

07:28.630 --> 07:35.360
Now we can see that the gallery is occupying 100 percent of the screen but if you resize the screen

07:35.390 --> 07:35.720
look

07:39.720 --> 07:46.470
if the width is smaller than eleven forty pixels as we defined it it's not so big

07:51.810 --> 07:52.770
the same thing for the Y.

07:52.770 --> 07:57.660
This we can test that directly here in the element of Spectre.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.860
If you wish set here to wide

08:03.780 --> 08:10.260
and now as you can see the width is only slightly larger than the container but only when the viewport

08:10.290 --> 08:18.030
is at least eleven forty pixels Hossam but there is only one strange thing happening and maybe that's

08:18.030 --> 08:23.240
a good invert bug if I try to do the same thing for video it won't work.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.700
Let's add a YouTube video block for example

08:29.810 --> 08:35.330
and I say it as a full with block well here in Gutenberg.

08:35.380 --> 08:38.800
It looks nice but look what happens when we preview

08:44.190 --> 08:45.260
Mm hmm.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.390
Look at that.

08:46.660 --> 08:53.950
That sucks to solve that for now we're gonna need some tricks but that you do for the next lesson.

08:54.010 --> 08:54.580
See you then.
