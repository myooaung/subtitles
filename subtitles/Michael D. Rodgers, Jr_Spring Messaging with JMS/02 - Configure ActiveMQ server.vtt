00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Instructor] Lets download and run

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.000
Apache ActiveMQ instance.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.010
We'll need, at a minimum, Java 8 installed

4
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.090
for ActiveMQ to run.

5
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.020
You can start by going to this download page

6
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.070
and click on the latest release.

7
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.070
At the time of this recording, the latest release

8
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.020
was 5.15.3, so I'll click on that.

9
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.070
If you're using a Windows PC, click on the Windows link.

10
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.080
If you're using a Mac or Linux Distro,

11
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.040
you can click on the Linux distribution link.

12
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.090
After it's downloaded, I like to move the download

13
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.020
to an application folder, or you can keep it

14
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.020
right here in the downloads,

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.010
but you will need to unzip it.

16
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
Once unzipped, using your terminal or command line program,

17
00:00:49.010 --> 00:01:03.070
navigate to the Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.3 bin directory.

18
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.090
Apache ActiveMQ makes it fairly easy

19
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.000
to start up an instance of the server

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.090
by invoking the following command.

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.020
./ActiveMQ, start.

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.030
On Linux or Mac, be sure to type ./ActiveMQ, start.

23
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.010
If you're using a Windows Distro,

24
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.040
you'll see an ActiveMQ.bat, so you would

25
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.010
have to type ActiveMQ.bat start.

26
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.030
With the instance started up,

27
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.050
you can see that everything is good to go.

28
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's open up a browser and verify that it started up.

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060
In the browser window, type in

30
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:55.040
HTTP://localhost:8161, hit enter.

31
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:07.020
Type in HTTP://localhost:8161/admin and hit enter.

32
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.000
This will cause a dialog box to appear using basic auth.

33
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.030
The default credentials are admin and admin,

34
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.070
and then log in.

35
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.040
Now that it's started, you should

36
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.060
see the following web console.

37
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.050
Quickly clicking on some of the links,

38
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.040
you'll see queues, topics, subscribers,

39
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.040
connections, network, scheduled, and send.

40
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.050
This course is not really an ActiveMQ course,

41
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.060
so I don't wanna spend too much time here.

42
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.000
The reason we chose ActiveMQ for this tutorial

43
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
is that you don't have to specify

44
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.050
queue or topic names via the console,

45
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.050
although you can if you like,

46
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.090
but this makes it so much easier for us to move on

47
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.090
and focus on Spring JMS instead of

48
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.060
how to configure an MQ server.

49
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.020
Okay, so let's go back to our terminal window

50
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.090
and let's stop the instance.

51
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.080
ActiveMQ stop.

52
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.010
Alright, we're done here.

53
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.000
Now, we can look at connecting this ActiveMQ instance

54
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and sending it a message.
