Spring is known as the premier API framework

7
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.080
for developing Java applications in enterprise environments.

8
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.000

Also learn how to use Spring's JMS message convertors,

11
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.030
or how to create your own.

12
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.080
I'll show you the best practices for configuring

13
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.060
connections and pooling.

14
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.080
I'll do this while creating a simple application

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.030
that sends messages between a storefront app

16
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.090
and warehouse using JSON formatted messages.

17
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.090
I'll cover highly important topics like

18
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.040

19
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.070
safely handle message failures.

20
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.030

21
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.050
strategies, like configuring dynamic destinations.

22
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.080
Additionally, I'll cover creating and using custom

23
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.000
JMS header properties.

24
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.090
My name is Michael Rodgers, and I am a software engineer

25
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.070
with over 11 years of Java development experience.

26
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.000
