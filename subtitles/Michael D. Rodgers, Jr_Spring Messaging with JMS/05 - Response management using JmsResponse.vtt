00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.030
- [Instructor] Let's look at dynamic destination strategies

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.020
by using Spring's JMS response object.

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.040
Using the JMS response object, we can compute

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.040
the destination response at runtime,

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.070
making this a dynamic process.

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.060
The JMS response object requires a JMS listener annotation

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.090
to work properly.

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.090
And using it offers us the ability

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.060
to look at our order state, custom header property,

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.000
and decide which queue to send the message to.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.040
Open up the WarehouseReceiver class

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.080
and go the receive method.

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.060
We will wrap the message ProcessedBookOrder

14
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.030
with a JMS response, so we'll do it like so.

15
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.030
We'll type

16
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.060
Jms

17
00:00:50.060 --> 00:01:00.040
Response.

18
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.000
Again, we'll wrap this in the carat brackets.

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.060
Because we are gonna be using Spring's JMS response object

20
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.020
for dynamically setting our destinations,

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.000
we will not need the @SendTo

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.030
annotation anymore, so we'll just remove that.

23
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.070
From the previous videos, we added the MessageHeaders

24
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.080
parameter to demonstrate multiple ways

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.040
of accessing headers for a given message.

26
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.030
We're not using this anymore as well,

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:46.000
so we can remove that parameter.

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.030
This is pretty much all we're going to do here.

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.000
We'll move over to the WarehouseProcessingService

30
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.030
to make the rest of our changes.

31
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.050
In the WarehouseProcessingService, we'll also wrap

32
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:11.060
the return type in a JMS response as we did previously.

33
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.010
We're going to be demonstrating how to dynamically

34
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.080
send messages to different queues.

35
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.070
So to make this a bit easier for us,

36
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.040
we'll create two static final variables at the top.

37
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.030
We'll call them private

38
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.000
static final String.

39
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.080
And the first one will be called the Processed_Queue

40
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.080
and we'll assign this a value of

41
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.040
book.

42
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.000
order.

43
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.090
processed.

44
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.070
queue.

45
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.070
Second one we'll create is also a static final variable

46
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.060
of type String.

47
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:07.080
And we're gonna call this one the Canceled_Queue,

48
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.090
assigned with a value of book.order.

49
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.080
canceled.

50
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.060
queue.

51
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.070
Next, let's modify what is returned

52
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.010
for each of the if else statements.

53
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.040
I'm going to create a private

54
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.020
member variable here.

55
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.050
We'll type Message

56
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.050
ProcessedBookOrder and we'll just call this our

57
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.020
message.

58
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.080
Now, inside the first if statement, remove the return

59
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.050
and assign it to the message.

60
00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.000
We'll do this for each of the return types here.

61
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.030
Okay, so let's create a JMS response object and return it.

62
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.010
Go back to the first if clause, hit Enter.

63
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.030
We'll type return

64
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.070
JmsResponse

65
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.040
and we're gonna say forQueue.

66
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.070
And for this one, we're gonna pass in the message

67
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.040
and then the destination

68
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:40.030
is going to be our Processed_Queue.

69
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.040
And actually, we can do this.

70
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.050
Copy this and paste this for the update

71
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.040
because we're using the same process queue.

72
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.030
We'll copy and paste as well as here,

73
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.090
but we'll change the Processed_Queue now to the

74
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.050
Canceled_Queue

75
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.060
because we're deleting

76
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.030
the request.

77
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.090
Okay, so again, we're going to

78
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.080
compile

79
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.050
and build the application

80
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.050
and then we'll run it.

81
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.030
And we have an error again.

82
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.060
Line 36, WarehouseReceivers.

83
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.090
Ah, should remember we removed that.

84
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.010
So we don't need that there.

85
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:38.030
Okay, let's do this again.

86
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:55.000
Okay, so let's run the app.

87
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.080
With the application compiled and running,

88
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.050
let's navigate again to our browser.

89
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.070
And we'll minimize, take that out of full-screen.

90
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.020
Refresh our page.

91
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.010
And select Lost at Sea, change the name up.

92
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.070
And let's change another one and say Update.

93
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.060
Add to Order.

94
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.080
And now, we're going to add a Cancel.

95
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.090
Add to Order.

96
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:30.080
Okay, so let's go to our MQ.

97
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.020
Go to our queues

98
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.070
and you'll notice that we have a canceled queue

99
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.060
with one record.

100
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.010
This is for the record that we deleted.

101
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.080
Order state, deleted.

102
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.000
The store ID and the message.

103
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
For our processed queue, we have four records.

104
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.010
We have an updated

105
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.000
and we have an added.
