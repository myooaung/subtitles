00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.050
- [Instructor] CachingConnectionFactory is

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.040
the third way we look at configuring a connection to a MAM.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.010
The CachingConnectionFactory is a subclass

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.020
of the SingleConnectionFactory.

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.050
It too returns the same connection for all

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.000
creatConnection calls,

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.070
as well as ignores Connection.close.

8
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.050
CachingConnectionFactory, similarly, is thread-safe

9
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.050
and the spring API says that RecconectonException

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.060
flag is defaulted to true for CachingConnectionFactory,

11
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.070
which is the opposite of the single connection factory.

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.080
The CachingConnectionFactory allows optionally

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.010
caching of consumers and producers.

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.060
On startup, if not changed, it will only cache one session,

15
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.010
but you can however change this session size.

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.060
Let's open our JMS config, and locate

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.060
the connection factory.

18
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.010
We'll change our return type from

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.080
SingleConnectionFactory to...

20
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.030
CachingConnectionFactory.

21
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.060
We'll also change the SingleConnectionFactory object

22
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:33.000
to CachingConnectionFactory.

23
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.040
We'll comment out the set reconnect on exception,

24
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.090
because this is set to true by default for us.

25
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.070
Reconnecting on exception is helpful when you don't

26
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.020
want your processing to die,

27
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.090
because of a lot of lost connection.

28
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.000
Reconnecting on exception is a nice feature to have.

29
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.070
The other thing we're going to do here,

30
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
is set our our set cache in size.

31
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.030
So we'll type factory.setSessionCacheSize,

32
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.040
and we'll set it to 100,

33
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.080
which might be overkill for our single usage.

34
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.060
You can actually set it to any number.

35
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.080
Just remember that by default,

36
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.080
it only caches a single connection,

37
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.090
so it sorta makes sense to set this number

38
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.000
to something greater than one.
