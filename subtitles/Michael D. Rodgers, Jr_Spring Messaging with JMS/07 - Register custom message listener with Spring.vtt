00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.030
- With that done, lets register our message listener

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.090
in our JMS config class.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.000
We'll do this first by making our JMS config class

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.030
as well implement

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.010
another class.

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.020
We'll have this implement the JMS listener

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.040
configurer.

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.080
This will as well, require us to implement

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.060
some abstract methods.

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:36.030
We'll implement the configure JMS listener.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.010
Before we implement this method,

12
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.050
we're also gonna create another spring bean.

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.010
We'll call this our bean,

14
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.000
and this is gonna be for our book listener.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.020
We'll type book order

16
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.030
processing message listener

17
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.070
and we'll call this our JMS message listener.

18
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.060
Will instantiate a book order

19
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.060
processing message listener.

20
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.070
We'll return the listener.

21
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010
With that done, let's turn our attention

22
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.050
back to the method configure JSM listeners.

23
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.080
What we're going to do is register a custom

24
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.060
book order processing message listener.

25
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.020
So, we're going to type,

26
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.080
we're going to instantiate a simple JSM

27
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.030
listener endpoint.

28
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.030
We'll call this endpoint equals

29
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.020
new simple JMS listener,

30
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.030
and then we're going to

31
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.000
set the message listener

32
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.090
to our JMS message listener.

33
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.050
We're also going to set the destination

34
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.000
and in this case,

35
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.020
our destination is gonna be book order

36
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.090
processed queue.

37
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:20.010
The endpoint, we're also going to set an ID.

38
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.020
We're gonna make this book-order-

39
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.080
processed-queue.

40
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.080
We're also going to set a subscription.

41
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.090
We'll just call this my subscription.

42
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.050
Then we're gonna set concurrency.

43
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.050
I'll set this to one.

44
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.060
Then the last thing we need to do

45
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.060
is we need to take the register property

46
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.010
that comes in for this override method.

47
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.080
We need to set the container factory,

48
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.000
which is gonna be our JMS listener

49
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.030
container factory.

50
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.000
Then also, in the register,

51
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.090
we need to register the endpoint

52
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.060
we just created.

53
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.090
We're gonna type in endpoint.

54
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.040
We're also gonna provide the JMS

55
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.060
listener container factory.

56
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.000
That's it.

57
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.070
Now, when we send messages,

58
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.020
it will process them to the warehouse.

59
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.010
From there, to the process book order object,

60
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.000
which will get the message

61
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and send it to the book order process queue.

62
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.090
From there, our custom message listener

63
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.000
will read it off the queue.
