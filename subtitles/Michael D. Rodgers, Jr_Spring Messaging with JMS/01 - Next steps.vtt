00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Instructor] So where do we go now?

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.010
There are a few topics which we didn't full explore

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.060
in the exercise files, or the course project,

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.070
and that concerns subscribing to,

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.080
and sending messages to a topic.

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.040
I mentioned earlier, in the application.yml

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.020
that the Spring jms pub-sub-domain property

8
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.080
is currently set to false.

9
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.060
If you enable this Spring will allow you to send,

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.050
and subscribe to topics.

11
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.050
This is an excellent next step

12
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.050
for the book store warehouse project.

13
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.090
I wanna challenge you to dig into the documentation,

14
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.010
and see if you can achieve this functionality.

15
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.050
I know you can.

16
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.020
Additionally I wanna challenge you

17
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.090
to invest some time learning Spring Integration.

18
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.070
Spring Integration is a framework for

19
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.030
Enterprise application integration.

20
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.030
It is designed to enable the

21
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.000
development of integration solutions

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.080
typically of event driven,

23
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.040
and message centric architectures.

24
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.080
Spring Integration as an API includes,

25
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.080
and makes available all the relevant Spring jms APIs.

26
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.010
And lastly, I'd like to invite you

27
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.040
to search the LinkedIn Learning

28
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.060
library for other Spring courses.

29
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.030
Thank you so much for taking my course.

30
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.000
I hope to see you again for future courses.
