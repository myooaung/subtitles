00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] We're going to modify the receiver.java

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.030
class, clean and build the app, and then run the app.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.030
We will look back at the ActiveMQ web console

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.030
to verify the messages have been read off the queue.

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.050
Let's go back to our receiver class

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.040
and remove the comments we placed previously.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.050
We will also modify the JMS listener annotation

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.010
and remove the connection factory property

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.060
since this will now be set via

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.080
a new Spring configuration bean.

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:41.060
Back on the application.java class file.

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.050
Let's go to the application class file now.

13
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.080
We will add a default

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:06.000
JMS listener container factory bean.

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.060
And we're gonna type the following:

16
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.060
DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory,

17
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.060
we'll call this a factory and we'll initialize it

18
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.000
with a new default listener Container Factory.

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.080
With the factory created, we will set our

20
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.010
connection factory

21
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.030
and we'll use the connection factory we

22
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.040
created earlier.

23
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.070
The other thing we're gonna do here,

24
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.090
is we're gonna set the factory concurrency level.

25
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.060
And we'll set this to 1-1.

26
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.040
And then we'll return the factory.

27
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.060
And that should be it.

28
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:09.040
Now, let's build the app.

29
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.090
And then we'll run it.

30
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.080
So now we'll type in how to run the app again.

31
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.090
Type in java-jar build/libs and then again,

32
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.000
this should be the only jar file located here,

33
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.020
so a tab should bring this up.

34
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.070
Hit Enter.

35
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.090
It will run pretty quickly, as you can see.

36
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.070
There's our message, order received, Hello.

37
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.060
And you also notice that the application didn't end

38
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.030
this time because the JMS listener is invoked.

39
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.010
Let's switch back to our ActiveMQ web console.

40
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.040
We'll click on queues.

41
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.040
And we'll notice that there are no messages left

42
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.020
in the order queue.

43
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.060
Clicking inside, likewise, demonstrates that the

44
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.040
message has been removed.

45
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.080
So we modified our receiver class and added

46
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.040
a default JMS listener container factory bean

47
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.060
and ran the application, then we verified the messages

48
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.000
have been removed.
