00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Instructor] In order to be really successful

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.060
in this course, you need to be comfortable with Java.

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.050
You don't necessarily need to be an expert,

4
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.090
but being able to navigate

5
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.070
through the different programming constructs

6
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.060
that we'll be using.

7
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.040
We'll be using Java 8 in this course.

8
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.030
You can use a more recent version of Java

9
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.030
but expect to have issues with Gradle version

10
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.000
and compatibilities when we perform builds.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.030
Additionally, because we're using Spring JMS API,

12
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.000
it's pretty important you're familiar

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.040
with the way Spring API works.

14
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.090
Again, you don't need to be an expert

15
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.060
but some minimal exposure to Spring is important.

16
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.060
Our builds will be done using Gradle.

17
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.010
If you're familiar with Maven,

18
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.080
then Gradle won't be too difficult for you to grasp.

19
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
The current version of Gradle used for this course is 4.6

20
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.050
along with JDK 1.8.

21
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.040
This course's exercise files are located in GitHub,

22
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.090
and you don't need to know a lot about Git

23
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.010
because I'll be walking you

24
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.030
through how to retrieve the necessary files.

25
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.080
Finally, any modern IDE will do,

26
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.000
like Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ.

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'll be using IntelliJ Community Edition for this project.
