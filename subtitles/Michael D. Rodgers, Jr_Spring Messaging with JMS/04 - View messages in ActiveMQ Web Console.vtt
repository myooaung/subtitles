00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Narrator] Now that we've modified our code

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.010
to add connection and send capabilities,

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.020
we can test those capabilities and view any messages

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.010
sent to our ActiveMQ instance.

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.020
First, open up our terminal window,

6
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.020
navigate to the directory again

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.040
where our patchy ActiveMQ instance resides,

8
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.090
and then drill down to the bin directory.

9
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.070
I'm already there.

10
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.070
Type in dot slash ActiveMQ, start.

11
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.070
I'm going to open up the web console in the browser

12
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.030
and verify that it's running.

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.040
Click on the queue's link to verify that no queue exists

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
or messages, for that matter.

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.040
So now, I can go back to our IDE

16
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.040
and run the application we worked on from the last session.

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.000
We've already built the app previously,

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.030
but if you didn't, in the terminal window

19
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060
run great old clean build.

20
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.040
Let's run the app though.

21
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:10.070
Type java dash jar build.

22
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.000
Libs, and this should be the only application here,

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.090
so if you hit tab, then hit enter.

24
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.050
It will run pretty quickly.

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.010
Let's switch back over the ActiveMQ web console

26
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.010
in the browser and see if any messages were created.

27
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.070
Eureka!

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.050
We have not only a message queue created automatically,

29
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.080
but we also have a message.

30
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.010
Let's click on the queue created.

31
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.070
Order queue and see what we have.

32
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.070
As you can see, there's one message listed

33
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.060
with some details on the message ID column

34
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060
that pertain to the machine.

35
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.010
Click on the message and let's see what's inside.

36
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.060
So, this screen gives us some more details

37
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.070
on the JMS message header information

38
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.040
as well as the actual message.

39
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.010
Alright, we've started up ActiveMQ instance

40
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.090
and ran our app and now we see not only

41
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.030
that the message queue was created automatically,

42
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.000
but it has a message.
