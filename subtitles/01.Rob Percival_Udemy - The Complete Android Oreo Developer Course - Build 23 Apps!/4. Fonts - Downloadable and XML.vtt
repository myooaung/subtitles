WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.760
So an android 8.0 or you know we got some awesome new features around fun.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.650
So the big ones are downloadable fonts and also fonts in SML So let's start first with downloadable

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.370
fonts and the basic idea here is that it's similar to fonts that you'll see on web sites So Google has

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.220
the Google fonts Web site where there's a bunch of different fonts that you can access but they're all

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.470
sort of available at one central location sort of a bunch of Web sites all reference the same fonts

6
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.210
in the same location.

7
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.680
Hopefully users that use those fonts will have them cached on their browsers and they won't have to

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.080
read download them all the time and so basically that's what's trying to happen here with Android 8.0

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.870
so you can see there may be multiple apps that are still looking for one particular font.

10
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.710
And if there's a font provider that has that we can save those in a font cache and that app can then

11
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.510
access them.

12
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.120
So Google is set up and they've made their phones available so that anybody can go and get them there.

13
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.650
But you know also other people could be fought providers so it's a pretty interesting way that they

14
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.620
have that set up.

15
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.710
So there's a couple of different ways that you can do this.

16
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.440
I think the best is through Android studio here so let's go ahead and create a new project we're going

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.150
to go ahead and call this Funt fun.

18
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.010
Now technically you can get to all this font stuff in any API higher than 14 which you can see is pretty

19
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.670
far back.

20
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.310
But let's go ahead and roll on the latest API 26 and we'll just go ahead and make a new app here.

21
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.870
So while this is loading up basically what we need to do is you know we're going to have a new text

22
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.490
view we're going to go in and try and set it's font family and it's going to give this option to say

23
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.510
more fonts and if we go ahead and we do that we can go get a particular font from this option for here.

24
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.840
Has Google fonts but again you can get them from other providers.

25
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.540
So that's the basic flow that we're going to be going for here.

26
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.720
And while this is opening up let me talk about the phantom Exham.

27
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.320
So the basic idea here is that you can make fonts a resource and so you can add them into your new resource

28
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.050
folder as a font and you can get to them by you know either reference to them at Font slash my font

29
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.380
or our DOT font dot my font so you know kind of cool that you can directly add those and just reference

30
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.830
them so we're actually going to be using downloading a Google phone and then bringing that in that will

31
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.830
be kind of interesting to see how that goes.

32
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.250
But now with Android studio up and running here let's go ahead and move over to our main activity X

33
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.110
m-L.

34
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.070
So whenever we create a new project it has that hello world text view for so we're just going to go

35
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.520
ahead and use that one and try and alter its font.

36
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.330
So let's give Android studio a second to load up here.

37
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.500
There we go.

38
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.360
So we're going to select this text view.

39
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.140
Then over here on the right side we want to view all attributes and we're going to move down till we

40
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.230
can find its font family.

41
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.130
There we go.

42
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.880
So you can see when we go to choose this we can scroll through and there's lots of different options

43
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.020
here.

44
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.580
But if we do more fonts you can see there's a couple of options here and if we have for source Google

45
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.300
fonts This is where you know he get all the goo ones so these are kind of the standard Android ones.

46
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.770
But look at all these awesome ones that are out here.

47
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.500
So for example let's find one that really sticks out in the atomic age.

48
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.410
That look pretty cool so maybe we select this one.

49
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.830
And we want to check this box for say create downloadable font and so we'll go ahead and choose this

50
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.950
one font name atomic age.

51
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.930
So go ahead and say OK to this.

52
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.630
And now you can see we get that hello world in that cool little text.

53
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.160
But the bigger idea with all of this is that now if there are other apps that are going to be using

54
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.670
this font right like you know this is maybe our.

55
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.370
But there's three other apps that are going to use that.

56
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.060
They can all look for the same font via the font cache.

57
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.880
And that means that not all the apps have to add them to their project.

58
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.340
It just makes it that much easier.

59
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.720
So this is kind of a really really big idea by Android.

60
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.660
Assuming that you know people are going to really enjoy these Google fonts because right now seems to

61
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.520
be the only source.

62
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.440
Again those can be added from other places in the future but seems to be the most popular and the ideas

63
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.820
that you know these apps will look to those for the source of their fonts.

64
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.580
Now let's go to the other option where this says hey no I just want to add my own font into my project

65
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.530
and be able to use that one.

66
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.470
So first we have to have a font file in order to do that.

67
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.490
So let's go ahead and open up a new tab.

68
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.670
And in this we are going to search for Google fonts.

69
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.660
It's funny I'm using Duck Duck Go To get to a Google product here.

70
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.210
But here we go Fahnestock Google dot com.

71
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.430
All right.

72
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.500
Once this opens up we just want to show you some sort of fun.

73
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.370
Let's do something that we can definitely determine that that is our particular fund you know there's

74
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.450
so many here.

75
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.780
Oh this one looks cool.

76
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.890
Glory Hallelujah fun here so let's go ahead and we'll hit the plus button on this.

77
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.890
And family selected.

78
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.860
Look at that so this is I told you kind of the ideas in web development and you can link to these Google

79
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.390
fonts and then if lots of web sites do that they should be cached.

80
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.090
But we're going to hit the download button here because we want to you know use this particular file.

81
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:40.640
So let's just go ahead and save that and once we have that there go ahead and open up that download

82
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.260
case.

83
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.750
Now that's got a folder for us I'm going to move this to my desktop and if we go to the desktop look

84
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.830
at that we get that T T F file.

85
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.190
So in order to add your own font into Android studio with this SML stuff we've got to go create a new

86
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.000
directory.

87
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:07.230
So we're going to go to Android studio bring up our side project and open up our app rez and then we're

88
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.940
going to right click here.

89
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.860
And we want to do the new Android resource directory.

90
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.850
So go ahead and select that.

91
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.230
Now what we're looking for here is font's.

92
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.720
So we'll go ahead and say Fonte I need to make sure it's fun with no s.

93
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.540
There we go.

94
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.240
So we want it to be font resource type.

95
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.320
This is where we want to select fonts so we have font font that looks good we'll hit OK and file already

96
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.370
exists.

97
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.100
Oh well I guess we are.

98
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.130
Oh that's because the atomic age was added in there.

99
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.560
OK.

100
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.720
So we already have atomic age now that we have and let's go ahead and look at that file so you can see

101
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.280
what that looks like.

102
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.650
So it's telling us here where it is that we can go and grab this font with all that.

103
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.430
But you know let's say we want to add our own font inside of here.

104
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.590
So let's go back to Firefox.

105
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.950
And with this now we can simply add some files to that font folder.

106
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.500
So let's go back to android studio and I'm going to right click and say reveal and finder.

107
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.190
So this brings up that folder and I can go from my desktop and say oh here's this thought TFF file and

108
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.610
I'll place that in.

109
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.050
Now I've done that I can right click here and I can say synchronize font and that's now going to show

110
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.080
the glory hallelujah and it gives you in this nice little you know preview of how this should look.

111
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.970
OK.

112
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.280
So once we have this in place again it's very simple now to go get to this so if we go back to our main

113
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.760
activity and I want to change the font family on this one look.

114
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.320
Gloria hallelujah.

115
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:50.810
I just select that one and boom you can see now we have that nice sort of hand-drawn hello world showing

116
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:51.310
up there.

117
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.870
So in addition to this you can create font family so within one if you want to have you know different

118
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:02.600
ones for if there is an Italic version or regular A bold bold italic like all those different things

119
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.270
you can add those in there and you know you can.

120
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.360
This is where you're going to be using the M-L to create like the font family and all that stuff.

121
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:19.280
But yeah and again if you wanted to access this glory hallelujah in your code you get to with our DOT

122
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.380
for my fun.

123
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.690
In fact let's go ahead and just prove this out for a second let's go to our main activity.

124
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.160
All right so here we're doing the content for you but let's you know we could say our font and look

125
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.040
there's that Glory hallelujah.

126
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.100
So there you have it.

127
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.700
That's a little tip on fonts there hopefully to make your app that much better looking I believe fonts

128
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.010
are a very small thing that you can do that have a big impact on your app when people see an app with

129
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.530
a specialized font especially for that app that you know sort of fits with the style of it.

130
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.890
It just shows that there's that much more attention to detail.

131
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.160
So hope you enjoyed learning about the new fun stuff.
