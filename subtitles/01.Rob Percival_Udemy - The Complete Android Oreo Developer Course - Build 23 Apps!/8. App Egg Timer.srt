1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,730
All right.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,220
Hello.

3
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to the egg timer app.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,610
I want to show you the finished product of where it is that we want to get.

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,610
So I want you to create an app that has a timer like this where you can just set a you know amount of

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,310
time for a short period maybe you know a minute 58 and you go in all sudden your timer is going to start

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,100
counting down and you can stop and you'll notice we got this grayed out so we can't go ahead and update

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,830
that but if we hit the stop button this will reset it back to 30 seconds and I'll show you if we bring

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,690
it down to a smaller amount of time I'm going to turn up the sound here.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,410
We want to have some sort of alarm or something play when the timer finishes.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,940
So yeah check that out.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,100
Pretty cool.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,370
So this is what I want you to create.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,010
I'm going allow you to go ahead and do this on your own again and when you do things by yourself that's

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,110
where the real learning takes place of course I'll walk through how to complete it.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,930
But I want you to have the opportunity to do this on your own.

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,230
Now as far as there's really two things you've got to go get before you do this and that's the picture

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,530
of an egg and some sort of sound that you want to play when the alarm ends.

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,750
So for the time or rather I just went ahead and searched egg on google images found this one on clip

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,080
art panda dot com so if you'd like to find one similar I'd just suggest going to Google Images also

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,760
for the air HOERR sound.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,520
I found one on sound Bible dot com so you can go get these exact ones if you want to really I just recommend

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,330
googling to go find the proper you know image and sound and you can just go ahead right click save that

24
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,370
image for here on sound Bible you have to click the empty three button to go ahead and download that.

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,630
But that's how you get those.

26
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,940
And again I want you to eventually arrive at an app like this.

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,760
Try as much as you can on your own.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,560
Then we'll come back.

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,060
I'll show you how I did it and maybe you'll learn from the differences between us.

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,420
Good luck.

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,210
All right.

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,590
Let's go ahead and get started here.

33
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,380
We want to create a new project for this egg timer.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,680
I'm going to call my project appropriately egg timer and I'll just go ahead and do the defaults for

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,480
all these hit enter through there.

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,200
And then while this is setting up we have our air horn sound we have a image that we need to get.

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,120
So I've already got those downloaded there on my desktop.

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,630
You can see them but we need to appropriately get them into the project so the first one that we want

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,810
to add is the egg to our draw draw a fold or so we're going to right click here.

40
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,370
We're going to say reveal in Finder.

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,680
And with that we'll go ahead and take our egg.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,710
We want to put images in there and we'll just drop the egg there.

43
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,320
OK and the next thing we want to do inside of Rez is we want to make a new directory.

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,430
I'm going to call this raw.

45
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,380
This is going to hold our audio file.

46
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:50,040
So right click on raw here and we'll say reveal and finder and then we'll go ahead and take our air

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,370
horn noise here and we'll go ahead and put it in raw go.

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,940
Now with both of these just to make sure we're up to date we're going to say synchronized rah.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,130
We're also going to right click drawable say synchronize Yes synchronize selected files.

50
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,810
There we go.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,560
OK.

52
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,830
So now that we have those two in place let's go ahead and work on the visual side of the app.

53
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,150
I feel like it's usually best when you're working on a project that's visually get it set up right and

54
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,620
then let's write all the code to make it magical and work.

55
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:29,080
So we'll go ahead and start on this main activity ourselves to room some room to work with here.

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,110
And the first thing that we want to do is we want to bring in the Sikh bar so see if we've got a seat

57
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,480
bar here I guess before we do that let's get rid of that text view that we had before and we'll go ahead

58
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,330
and bring in the Sikh bar and we want to have this thing stuck up to the top.

59
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,330
Let's go ahead and just do.

60
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,590
Maybe a margin of five.

61
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:55,410
We also want it connected to the sides here so let's maybe say you know on this side we wanted to have

62
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,870
you know five as well.

63
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,330
And on the right side again let's go ahead and do something like five.

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:09,300
Now with this we've got to make sure we select this and we'll fiddle around here till we get to extend.

65
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,210
Perfect.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,440
So now we've got the Sikh bar which is in a good place.

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,850
Now the next step is we need to go ahead and get an image view so that we can show the egg their souls

68
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,860
go ahead and go to our images here.

69
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,620
There there's an image you will go ahead and bring that out.

70
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,780
All right.

71
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,370
So it wants to put something in there.

72
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,060
Let's go ahead and select that beautiful egg that we had before we cut those nice big eggs.

73
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,870
That's showing up and let's go ahead and connect it with what we've got so go up to the top.

74
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,230
We want it to be fairly close.

75
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,110
You know your numbers you can totally pick what you want these to be.

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm kind of having a fun time with the number five here so let's go ahead and see what that looks like.

77
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,600
If we if we find that we don't like it we can always go ahead and change it.

78
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,840
So this is something you just got to kind of play around with and find what you think works best.

79
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,730
OK.

80
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,320
So we have the Sikh bar.

81
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,450
We have the egg.

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,180
Really the next thing for us is we need a label to be able to show a text for you rather.

83
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,490
How much time is left here.

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
And then we need a button so let's go ahead and go to our text.

85
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,180
We'll bring out a text for you here.

86
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,380
I think it might just be best if we have it centered maybe here inside of the egg so go ahead and just

87
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,830
say that this thing should be centered.

88
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,050
I forget with this you want to go ahead and right click here.

89
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,440
And we want to go as a center we'll start with horizontally and parent.

90
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,290
Right click and say center vertically imperent.

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,080
OK.

92
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,160
So we've got that at the center of the screen.

93
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,710
Let's start with some default text of maybe saying you know there's 30 seconds on the timer or something

94
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,680
like that but it's really really tiny right now like kind of hard to see.

95
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,180
Tiny so you can actually go here and change what you want this to look like.

96
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,970
I kind of just prefer going in and changing the raw size of this so go ahead and scroll down till we

97
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:10,200
get to the text attributes here so go ahead and find text size here.

98
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,260
And you know totally up to you.

99
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,120
Let's maybe see what something like 36 looks like that's a little bit bigger.

100
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,710
But you know we could even go bigger Let's just see for example what like 60 espie looks like.

101
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,970
Now that to me that looks pretty good.

102
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,130
Again your discretion you get to choose how that looks but looks pretty good there.

103
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,000
And really the last thing that we just need is the button.

104
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,560
OK.

105
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,290
So go ahead and grab our button here.

106
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,130
We're going to put it right below the text view.

107
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,430
And we want to make sure that we have a good connection here.

108
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,310
So let's go ahead and get back.

109
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,680
Need to hide all of our attributes here.

110
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,630
Here we go and we'll go ahead and just do our little up here that connects it automatically with the

111
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,240
timer above it and I think we're at a pretty good position so if you want to you can right click this

112
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,250
and say Center horizontally imperent that's just to make sure it stays in the center.

113
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,810
But that should be enough there we do want to change what the button says so we can change that to maybe

114
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,420
something like Go.

115
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,320
This is going to change throughout the course of the app depending on you know if the timer is going

116
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,540
or not but at least this is a good start here.

117
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,120
OK.

118
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,590
So apps looking pretty good.

119
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,600
Let's go ahead now work on the program back side of things.

120
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,280
Oh I almost forgot we need to set everything here so for example with the Sikh bar we have to give it

121
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,100
a proper ID so I'll say something like Taimur seek bar for the image view.

122
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,310
Yes.

123
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:48,380
So go ahead and just call this egg image view for this text view.

124
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,670
Go ahead and call this count down text view.

125
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,060
Excellent.

126
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,400
And yes go ahead and update all those references.

127
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,920
And then lastly for the button we'll call this something like Go button.

128
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,710
OK.

129
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,390
So we now finally got everything in place all the proper IDs are showing up here.

130
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,150
Now we can finally go do the programmatic stuff.

131
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,300
So before we do move forward I want to show we got a little bit of a lay out tiff here you can go ahead

132
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,120
and switch this back to portrait if you want.

133
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,810
And I somehow got arrived on a Nexus 10.

134
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,990
I think we had a Nexus 4 before.

135
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,440
So anyways that's how we can fix the way out of that stuff.

136
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,910
But let's go ahead and make it so that when we move the slider we can actually change this text for

137
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,510
you to show the appropriate time that we would want to go start the time around.

138
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,640
So a couple of things that we've got to do here.

139
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,810
The first of which is we've got to get access to the bar and we've got to get access to the text view.

140
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,190
So first let's go ahead and do CPR saying we're going to have a sick bar.

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:02,580
Let's just call the timer seek bar OK and this is going to be equal to fine view by ID.

142
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:12,320
We'll do our capital R ID dot and let's go back and see what we named this time or seek part that would

143
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,140
make sense.

144
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,240
And also a timer seek bar.

145
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,580
Excellent stuff.

146
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,790
We also need access to the text view.

147
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:27,740
So let's make a new text view that we are going to call Taimur text view and again we'll do fine view

148
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,610
by Dady our dot dot.

149
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,720
And let's see what we've got for the name here.

150
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,990
And we have countdown text view right count text view.

151
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,180
Excellent.

152
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:47,210
So now we have access to both these things and it looks like we'd need to import the stuff for text

153
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,430
view.

154
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,900
So so we type in actually let's just hit enter there and that'll add it to our imports.

155
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,140
All right so with that we need to go ahead and set some initial values for CGC bar.

156
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,780
So let's go ahead and get the timer seek bar first thing that we want to do is we want to set what the

157
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,540
max could possibly be for this and we want the max for this to be 10 minutes.

158
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,560
And if you know this is referring to the slider's referring to the number of seconds that we've got

159
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,190
going on we would want to make it so that the max would be 10 minutes 60 seconds in a minute.

160
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,920
That would be 600 seconds.

161
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,820
Here is what we want.

162
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,440
OK.

163
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,000
The other thing that we want to set with the Sikh is what the current progresses at start time.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,040
So we're going to do set progress and let's just go ahead and do 30 seconds that's like our starting

165
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
position for the seat bar.

166
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,800
OK then with that whenever someone changes the CGC bar we want to be able to run some code so you know

167
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,290
we've done this a couple of times now you should have this no problem when you say on Seek bar change

168
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:56,200
listener again we'll do a new seek bar change listener Caig is a sees three awesome functions inside

169
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,350
of here so it's the progress changes the big one that we want to be working with here and the first

170
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:09,430
thing that we've kind of got to do is figure out you know if they are at 432 seconds like what does

171
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,760
that equate to in minutes in seconds.

172
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,570
Right because we don't want on our time here to just so show seconds like we want to show the minutes

173
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,720
and the seconds we wanted to be nice and organized there.

174
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,390
So in order to do that we can do a little bit of math here and to find the minutes we can create a new

175
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,730
event called minutes and the math that we're going to do here is we're simply going to take I which

176
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,510
is the number of seconds we're going to go ahead and divide that by 60.

177
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,240
OK.

178
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,620
And what that does is when it converts it into an end because you know maybe you know some number divided

179
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,550
by six is not going to be a whole number there's going to be a remainder thereby by saying that this

180
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,380
is going to be an aunt.

181
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:52,450
It's going to round it down to the next number which is going to show us the appropriate amount of minutes.

182
00:11:52,450 --> 00:12:00,820
So then in order to find the seconds we can say OK enough seconds is equal to whatever it is that's

183
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,350
the total seconds minus this minutes time 60.

184
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,510
So we can say minutes times 60 just like that.

185
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,940
And so essentially right like if there was a hundred and 22 seconds there you know that would mean that

186
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,080
there would be two minutes.

187
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,790
And if we did two minutes time 60 that's 120 so 122 minus 120 means that there's two seconds left.

188
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,480
Now you could leave this like this.

189
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,180
Personally I like to put little parentheses around here to say I want to do this first then that.

190
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,330
I think because of order of operations that will happen automatically but I kind of like to put the

191
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,250
parentheses around.

192
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,100
It makes me remember OK we're doing minute's time 60 first and then we're doing this subtraction there.

193
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,920
OK.

194
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,450
The next thing that we want to do then is update the text view so we're going to go ahead and get our

195
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,070
timer text view.

196
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,940
We're going to say time or text view that said text.

197
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,800
And this is where we want to put our information so we want to have the minutes and then the seconds

198
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:57,990
right.

199
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:04,900
So let's go ahead and convert the minutes we're going to say integer dot to a string.

200
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,490
There we go.

201
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,720
We're going to pass in minutes.

202
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,880
Excellent.

203
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:14,650
So that will give us a string so let's add to the string a colon to separate the minutes and the seconds

204
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,650
then we're going to add onto this the second.

205
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,380
So again we'll say integer

206
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,300
integers.

207
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:30,330
There we go to string and we're going to go ahead and pass in the seconds right there.

208
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,180
So that will go ahead and convert everything that we need.

209
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:40,070
So let's go ahead and get this on our app looks like I'm going to have to get my device up and running

210
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,250
and I haven't had it started for this project.

211
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:48,180
Wall that is loading up there there is something that I want to talk about and that's that when we do

212
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,390
this conversion of the minutes to the seconds we're going to run into an issue and the issue is is that

213
00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:01,680
for the seconds here like let's say for example you know we had 120 seconds on the countdown right so

214
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,840
120 divided by 60 that gives us two minutes and then you know 120 minus 120.

215
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,290
That means there's zero seconds.

216
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:15,450
Well when you do zero seconds and convert that to a string it's going to show like Two colon zero which

217
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:22,170
looks a little bit weird with time right like it's usually to call an 0 0 so there is a way around this

218
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,850
and it's by basically do an if statement to say hey you know we're working with you know zero seconds

219
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,230
we wanted to show double zeros.

220
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,580
So the way that we can fix this is by creating a new string.

221
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,530
For example we could call this the second string.

222
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,160
OK.

223
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:44,960
And with this we are going to go ahead and set this equal to do our proper integer conversion stuff.

224
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,620
Right so just like we've done before we're going to take this thing to string.

225
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,690
Go ahead and grab our seconds there.

226
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,280
Right.

227
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:59,190
But then this is where we want to do or if statements so we want to say if the go ahead get our parentheses

228
00:14:59,190 --> 00:14:59,750
in here.

229
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:06,890
If the second string is equal to the number 0 just the singular number is zero.

230
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,330
This is where we'd want to you know sort of update that.

231
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,560
So that was two zeroes there.

232
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,040
So this is where we want to say OK second string we're going to go ahead and say that you are now equal

233
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,370
to zero zero.

234
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:26,340
So if it is the case that for example you know there's one second two seconds three seconds whatever.

235
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,750
This if statement never gets called in we can just go ahead and use the second string.

236
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,190
But if not you know we kind of have this year here to sort of protect against that so we can go ahead

237
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,990
and take the second string.

238
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:43,310
And rather than doing this integer conversion we can go ahead and delete that and paste it there.

239
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,260
Now you may be wondering do we want to do the same thing for the minutes right like do we want to show

240
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,700
like 0 0 for the minutes.

241
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,230
Well that's up to you.

242
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,770
I mean it's kind of a personal preference thing.

243
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,840
You can decide.

244
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,280
I think it's probably better without.

245
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,530
I kind of like this the single zero example.

246
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,550
But again up to you with how you want to work that.

247
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,590
So let's go ahead and see what we've got here.

248
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,990
Go ahead and run on this one more time should see our app pop up.

249
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,400
Hey here it comes.

250
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,170
Excellent song.

251
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,460
Go ahead.

252
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,320
Move the slider and look at that.

253
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,500
We get those awesome numbers.

254
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,240
And as you can see I think this is the earlier code where you know we were saying you know if it was

255
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,330
equal to zero you know go ahead and do that double thing right.

256
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:39,840
So this is what we want to prevent so that it doesn't say you know 10 colon and then a singular zero

257
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,290
there.

258
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,250
So now with this new code let's go ahead and save and then run this

259
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,390
right we should see improvement here.

260
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,640
Now on our app so let's go ahead and move that to the edge.

261
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,870
You can for some reason that is not working.

262
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,970
Let me go ahead and take a look why.

263
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,890
So I figured out what the issue is I forgot that was strings rather than doing the two equal signs.

264
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,930
We want to go ahead and actually do a dot equals when you're comparing string.

265
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,930
This is the better way to handle it.

266
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:24,010
So if we go ahead and make that change with our IF statement we'll go ahead and open up our app and

267
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,610
you'll notice.

268
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,100
Now when we go ahead and move this there we go we get that double nice double zero.

269
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,510
And again I think the singular zero looks good.

270
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,240
That's up to you about you know whether or not you think that's a good idea.

271
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,710
You can totally choose.

272
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,540
So with that we should probably update on the visual side here rather than doing the double zero on

273
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,600
this should go ahead and change it.

274
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,980
We have a single zero.

275
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,890
Just to kind of keep things all uniform.

276
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,770
All right let's go ahead and keep moving forward so the next thing that we want to do is we want to

277
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,930
actually integrate a timer into this so that we can have some counting down and we can update the timer

278
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,700
as things are going on.

279
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,620
So the first thing that we got to do is we've got to go ahead with our button so the button is going

280
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,480
to kind of be the place that we kick off the timer.

281
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,390
And so with this we have to provide some name for its on click method here.

282
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:19,870
And so we're going to go ahead and just call this something like let's say button clicked.

283
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,550
So we got that name there.

284
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:27,610
Let's go ahead back and up here at the top inside of our class but not inside of the uncreate function

285
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,610
there we are going to go ahead and create a new function function method and we're going to save public

286
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:42,250
void and we're going to call this one button click to the same name that we had before inside of here

287
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,940
is going to get a parameter of a view.

288
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,800
OK.

289
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:52,260
We'll go ahead and do our little curly brackets there and let's make sure we get the proper code implemented

290
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,090
we want Android view of you.

291
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,110
So go ahead and hit enter there and just to confirm that at least things are working.

292
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,180
We're going to go ahead and just do a quick log here.

293
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:10,250
So we'll say Lagat thing and we'll say something like button pressed.

294
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,410
Nice exclamation point.

295
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,070
OK.

296
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,340
So we'll go ahead out or a little semi-colon there.

297
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,700
Let's go ahead and run this.

298
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:23,770
Make sure that our buttons working in order for that let's go ahead and get our log cat up and running.

299
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,510
And here we go showing up in the emulator now so go ahead and hit this button and look out.

300
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,910
We get the button pressed.

301
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,500
Nice.

302
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,810
Every time we click on that we get that showing up.

303
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,280
OK.

304
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,150
So that's good to know that we've got that showing up.

305
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,980
The next step for us is we want to go ahead and create a timer when the user hits that button.

306
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,850
So we're going to go ahead and create a new countdown timer.

307
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,740
Go ahead and hit enter on that.

308
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,950
And with this remember we want to go ahead and add you know how long we want it to run for.

309
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,490
And you know what the intervals are going to be so for now let's just go ahead and put in some big number.

310
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:11,520
That's one that's 10000 milliseconds so that'll be 10 seconds and we want this to go off like every

311
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,560
you know thousand milliseconds which is one second.

312
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,210
That's what we're looking for there or accidentally misplace this.

313
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,190
And in parentheses So we want to delete that.

314
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,830
Make sure that goes at the end here where we make a new count down timer and you know we've got our

315
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:32,100
nice curly brackets here and at the end of this we want to make sure we start it and put our semi-colon.

316
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,740
And then the last step for us is just to hover over here.

317
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,100
And then we can go ahead and implement our methods both the tick and the on finish.

318
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,380
So we'll go ahead and hit OK to that.

319
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:48,030
And now we can go ahead and actually write the code that's going to take in order for this all to happen.

320
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,580
So in regards to the on.

321
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:57,480
So every one second that goes by you know we want to know about what the current time is left and sort

322
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,120
of update that inside of the text view and if you think about it we already have all of that code down

323
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,280
here right where we take the time and we you know we turn this into minutes and then seconds that we

324
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,410
update this we do the special check to see for the double zero situation.

325
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,360
So let's go ahead and just sort of reuse this code.

326
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,780
We're going to make a new method here.

327
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:27,180
So outside let's go ahead and make a new method so we're going to see a public void and we want to go

328
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,580
ahead and call this one the update timer function.

329
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,430
Now we do have to go ahead and take in some sort of parameter here and so let's go ahead and take in

330
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,480
a function called seconds left.

331
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,430
OK.

332
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,190
And then we'll go ahead and do our curly brackets just like that.

333
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,590
So to start with let's remove the code from here put it inside of this new update timer function and

334
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,860
then call that here.

335
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,010
And then you know we'll sort of mix up or fix all the problems that we're going to get from that so

336
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:06,650
let's go ahead and cut that first paste it there then we're going to come down here and say update timer.

337
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,230
We're going to pass and I right which is the numbers of seconds that are left so this code now is fine.

338
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,560
There's no errors here but as you can notice we've got tons of issues left here.

339
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:22,310
So first let's take the seconds left and we're going to replace that with wherever we had seen previously.

340
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,470
So that's going to go in and fix those problems.

341
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,210
But then the timer text view that's another issue right because we had timer techs you being set up

342
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:30,530
here.

343
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:37,000
But we want to have access to it you know in other methods here so let's go ahead and delete this or

344
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,870
I'm going to copy this code here so that we can create the text view outside and then we'll just set

345
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,380
this as if it was already created in the will go to the top of the page here and say all right there's

346
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,640
going to be a new text view called timer.

347
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,170
And you'll notice I didn't bring along the final there.

348
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,230
That was code that Andrew to automatically added to me and when you have a final That means it can never

349
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,150
possibly change.

350
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,200
But when you have it as a property of your class you want it to be a little bit ambiguous and if you

351
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,730
do final you're going to get in there.

352
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,070
So that's why I got rid of that.

353
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,690
But you'll notice that gets rid of the air that we were having before.

354
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:19,070
And so now we have this really cool update timer function which here inside of her on tick method we

355
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,050
can go ahead and call update timer and then the only kind of math that we have to do here is we have

356
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:30,960
to take this L which is the number of milliseconds until the thing's all finished up and we've got to

357
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,540
divide that by a thousand so it turns into a second.

358
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:40,680
So we're going to take l and we're going to go ahead and divide that by 1000 and you'll see we get a

359
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,450
little bit of an air here and that's because we have a long and you know this function is looking for.

360
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,770
And so we have to pass this over and say hey go ahead and automatically convert this thing into an ant.

361
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,340
And when we do that we do get some working code here.

362
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,090
All right.

363
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:02,940
So before we go ahead and test this out I do want to go ahead and make sure that the finish code here

364
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,020
is working.

365
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:11,080
So let's go ahead and just log something here and we'll just say something like finished.

366
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,130
Time are all done.

367
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,140
OK.

368
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,780
And one more thing here is that before we had just put in some you know arbitrary amount of time when

369
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:28,250
in reality we actually want to go ahead use how much time as you know was a lot inside of the Sikh bar

370
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,030
because right now this would just do a 10 second countdown.

371
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,430
So rather than this we're going to go ahead and delete that.

372
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,320
And in order to get access to our time or seek part we're going to have to do a similar thing where

373
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,890
we're going to cut this code paste it up top so we can declare this as a.

374
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,170
So it can be accessed everywhere and will take this time or seek bar place that there.

375
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:57,020
And now we can go ahead and say OK time or seek bar get progress that's going to give us the number

376
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,060
of seconds that the user wanted to set.

377
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:04,770
And we just got to go ahead and multiply that by 1000 so then we're working with milliseconds.

378
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,270
OK.

379
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,200
So let's go ahead and run this.

380
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,300
See what it looks like in our app.

381
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,570
We'll go ahead and have log cat open here so we can see what's coming through for us so as we said before

382
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,330
we can kind of move this down just go ahead and see what it looks like when we do.

383
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,000
Nine seconds so look at that.

384
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,910
We get this cool countdown going here that's some awesome functionality.

385
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,040
Looking really really good.

386
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,390
But the one issue that we're going to have here is you'll see we got the timer all done.

387
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,410
But as we were going through on this timer let me go ahead and run this now.

388
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,660
Want to get to a shorter time you could see.

389
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,310
Well now that it's running we didn't see it but you could see like when there was six seconds left.

390
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,830
We'll see here in a second.

391
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,060
Right.

392
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,630
It doesn't look says 9:08 like would be good if it was 0 7 0 6 whatever.

393
00:25:53,630 --> 00:26:00,560
Right like we would like to have that option for our tests there so we can fix it here with our IF statement

394
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,170
rather than just seen if this string is equal to zero.

395
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,820
What we can do is just say hey if there's just a single digit meaning that if it's nine or less than

396
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,550
we want to just automatically go in the head and add a zero on to it.

397
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,350
So the if statement now that we're going to check with say OK we're going to take the number of seconds

398
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,610
which isn't it.

399
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:30,680
And when I say if the number of seconds is less than or equal to nine so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 we want

400
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,810
to place a zero in front of it.

401
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:39,260
So we're going to say the second string is now going to be equal to whatever the existing second string

402
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,530
was.

403
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,280
But just in front of that we are going to add a zero.

404
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,030
So go ahead and do that at our cool little plus button there.

405
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,090
And once that is in place let's go ahead and test our code.

406
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,720
Ok big moment here.

407
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,800
Here we go to the emulator.

408
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,310
So I'm going to bring this down and look at that we've got a nice timer so it's saying you know 0 3

409
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:13,230
0 6 and let's go ahead and hit go on this and we'll see log cat to see when that is finished and boom.

410
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:13,700
Look at that.

411
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,390
It says time are all done.

412
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,570
Now it's a little bit off if you've noticed this.

413
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:24,170
Let's go ahead and go back up to you know maybe something like nine seconds here.

414
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:30,750
I just want you to see once this hits zero that we don't exactly get the time or finished to show up

415
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,310
and we were hoping that it would.

416
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,620
Right so we hit zero.

417
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,780
And then it says time are all done.

418
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,690
And the reason for this happening is because with we when we get this timer I'm going to scroll to where

419
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,530
we've got this.

420
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,950
Let me get some space here.

421
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,770
OK.

422
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:53,250
So when we're setting the count countdown timers how long we want it to count for it right we say OK

423
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,720
if they want it to go for nine seconds nine seconds time a thousand that's nine thousand milliseconds.

424
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,520
And we're going to count down every one second.

425
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,620
Well the problem is is that by the time it takes to sort of run this code and come back instead of it

426
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,840
being 9000 milliseconds it's like eight thousand nine hundred fifty two or something like that.

427
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,790
And so it's just a little bit off.

428
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,620
So this is a tiny bit of a hack here but this is kind of the code that we need in order to make everything

429
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,890
work.

430
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,660
We're just going to add on a tenth of a second by saying hey take whatever time they wanted times a

431
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,180
thousand.

432
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:27,450
We're also going to add a hundred seconds there to sort of do this quick fix and make sure that everything's

433
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,600
all working there OK.

434
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,990
So let's go ahead and run our app one more time.

435
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,170
Can you see if this doesn't look a little bit better for us.

436
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:46,100
And once we've got this me moved down to some sort of time like six seconds cable go ahead and hit go

437
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,820
there.

438
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,390
Hard times coming down let me get Lague cat open.

439
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,370
I kind of missed our time in there.

440
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,100
Let's go ahead and try one more time.

441
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,450
So do like six seconds like this.

442
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:04,950
And it comes down and we hit zero and boom it says time are all done.

443
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:05,720
OK.

444
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,280
So we are in a pretty great spot.

445
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,030
Really all that's left for us is we've got to do a little bit more work with this button.

446
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,110
And we've also got to get that air horn in place.

447
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,460
We're also going to do some cool visual things.

448
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,020
But I mean we have the gist of a timer done so at least you know we've got that working for us.

449
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,130
All right so let's go ahead and write the code so that we can play the air horn noise when the timer

450
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,420
is all finished so rather than just doing the logging here we're going to go ahead and play a sound.

451
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:37,600
If you remember walking through this we need to create a new media player and was just go ahead and

452
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,500
call ours and player.

453
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:45,600
Now we're going to set this equal to a new media player and we want to do it to create.

454
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,600
We've got to pass this a couple of things so we need to pass a context and it can be tempting to do

455
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,410
this but that's going to refer to the timer that we're currently on.

456
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:59,590
So we actually do get application context and then needs to know what file it is that we're working

457
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,860
with.

458
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,420
So we're going to do our DOT RA.

459
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,360
Remember that's the name of our folder and then we're going to do dot air horn just like that.

460
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:13,690
So this creates the media player and it's amazing how simple Android is made this for us we just do

461
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,350
em player start and that is going to play our toys for us.

462
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:27,630
So let's go ahead and give this a run here the play button app opens up make sure I got a good amount

463
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,980
of sound here so you can see what's coming through.

464
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,120
So I'll bring this down slightly oh here comes the big countdown.

465
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,910
You're ready for this air horn.

466
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,170
Don't jump too much.

467
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,150
There it is.

468
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,660
OK.

469
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,940
So pretty cool.

470
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,290
All right.

471
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,160
We've got the sound functionality but the next thing for us is that while this timer is going so if

472
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,890
I go ahead and you know bring this up one is we want this button to then say stop and actually have

473
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,210
it stop the timer.

474
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,230
If that's what the user is looking for and we want to get rid of the CGC bar so that for example of

475
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,920
someone you know while this is counting down we don't want them to be able to move it it's going to

476
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,830
make all sorts of problems.

477
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,860
So let's go ahead and talk about how we can fix that.

478
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,160
So I think the first thing that we should fix is that if someone's going to hit the go button then we

479
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:20,220
should change the text of the button to say stop so that the user knows that they can go ahead and stop

480
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,510
that.

481
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:28,200
So what we're going to do is we're going to go to our code and downhere Excuse me up here when someone

482
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,100
has clicked this button there's a little bit of extra code that we want to run before we go ahead and

483
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,890
do all this countdown timer stuff.

484
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,330
So what we're going to do first is.

485
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,020
And there goes our horn.

486
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,050
Well that freaked me out.

487
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,740
I hit it twice so we have two horns.

488
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,400
That's why this code we're going to right now is going to make it so we can't have two horns go off

489
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,420
and we don't freak ourself out in the middle of stuff here.

490
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,380
But the first thing that we need to do is we need to make a boolean that you know tells us whether or

491
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,840
not the counter is active so we're going to go ahead and create a new boolean.

492
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,650
We're going to call this counter is active.

493
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,460
OK.

494
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:11,300
And we're just going to go ahead and set this initially equal to false.

495
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,030
Excellent.

496
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,170
And then what we're going to do here is when someone goes ahead and actually clicks the button we want

497
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,450
to do a few things so the first one is want to take this counter is active and set that equal to true

498
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,910
because we're saying OK you know someone is now starting up the timer.

499
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,800
We also want to go ahead and make it so that the Sikh bar can no longer be messed with so that the user

500
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,850
can't update that so we're going to say time or seek bar set enabled.

501
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,190
And we're going to set this equal to false.

502
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,250
So that can no longer be changed.

503
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,050
And then the last thing we're going to do is we're going to update the button which means then we have

504
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,100
to have access to the button.

505
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:57,970
So we're going to go ahead and create a new button and we'll just call this the go button and we'll

506
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:09,270
go ahead and set this up sort of create method say Go button is equal to fine view by ID if I remember

507
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,370
right we called it the go button.

508
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,640
Yep there we go.

509
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,090
Awesome.

510
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:19,530
Now that we have access to the skill button we can go ahead and change its text so will say Go button

511
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,610
that set text and we can go ahead and have that say Stop OK.

512
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,250
And I guess we use an exclamation point on the last one maybe we should do it here.

513
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,430
Both are very exciting things to make the timer go and stop.

514
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,270
All right.

515
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,770
So we've got all of that there.

516
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,110
Let's go ahead and just test it out see what it looks like.

517
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,390
And wait for our emulator here.

518
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,190
Pops up let me bring it down.

519
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,840
So I hit go here.

520
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,990
And now you can see it stop the you know seek bar here is disabled.

521
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,870
Awesome stuff.

522
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,560
But the issue is we can't stop anything.

523
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,560
In fact by just hitting a bunch of times and nine seconds we're going to get a jillion horns I'm going

524
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,720
to turn this down for a second because computers freaking out right now.

525
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,080
So that's kind of the next big thing for us to fix here.

526
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,700
So make it so that we can actually stop the countdown if that's going to be happening.

527
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:24,650
So the first thing that we want to do here is we want to do an if statement that says well checks whether

528
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,850
or not the counter is active.

529
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:32,390
So we're going to see if counter is active and we want to go ahead and say you know if this is true

530
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,510
we want to do something for God let's put our parentheses around that.

531
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,960
So if it is active This is where we you know would want to stop it and do all that stuff.

532
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,190
But the ELSE side of this is all the code that we already have for this.

533
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:50,120
I'm just going to go ahead and wrap that all in curly brackets nice Android studio tabbed everything

534
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,750
over for us.

535
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,730
That was great.

536
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:57,320
And now we need to sort of write all of the things that should be happening if someone wants to stop

537
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,650
the timer.

538
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,890
So the first thing that we want to do because someone's trying to stop this is we should probably update

539
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,990
our text view.

540
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,690
So let's take our time or text view and say that set text.

541
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,410
And let's just go ahead and get this back to the 0 30 position.

542
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,480
OK.

543
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:19,160
Along with that we should actually update the Sikh bar to get to that position so we're going to say

544
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,690
set progress and we'll go ahead and update that to be 30.

545
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,690
Excellent.

546
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:32,510
OK so we've kind of done the CGC bar in the text you I guess we should re-enable the seek bar so that

547
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:38,670
someone can actually work with that so we're going to say our timer seek bar that set enabled.

548
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,480
And now we want to go ahead and change that to be true.

549
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,820
Excellent.

550
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,990
The next thing that we do is we want to stop the counter that we have here.

551
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,730
So in order to do that we have to have access to this we're going to go ahead and cut this pace up above

552
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:59,270
and now take our countdown timer and say countdown timer is equal to this so then we can say all right

553
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:05,390
count down timer dot and then we're going to do cancel.

554
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,630
This will stop it from continuing any further.

555
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,750
We also want to update the button so that changes back to go.

556
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:18,980
So we'll go to our literally go to our go button and we're going to say set text and we're going to

557
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,450
change that to say go.

558
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,260
Exclamation point.

559
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,550
That looks good.

560
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:28,430
And with all of this they're really the last thing that we just need to do is we need to say OK.

561
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,350
Counter is active.

562
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:36,710
We want to go ahead and switch this now to actually be false so that we can sort of switch back and

563
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,430
forth between the two of them.

564
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,160
So hopefully we've got everything there.

565
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,570
Let's go ahead and test this out make sure that that's working for I mean there's a lot of stuff that

566
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,950
goes on for stopping a timer here but hopefully we got it all.

567
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,770
So let's go ahead and go down to a smaller time so here's 11 seconds.

568
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,500
Everything was disabled and I can go ahead and say stop.

569
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,980
And just like that this is now re-enabled you know the go buttons there again.

570
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,960
And I can actually you know go ahead and start this thing one more time.

571
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,910
Let's make sure that the horn is still going off.

572
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,890
I didn't hear it earlier.

573
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,150
I know I had the volume down but I successfully stopped it.

574
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,590
There we go we got the proper sound so really the last thing that we just got to fix is when the timer

575
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,410
runs out.

576
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:26,580
It's a little bit awkward now for the user to say oh OK now how do I start a new timers it's like stop

577
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,830
this one and then I'm back at 30.

578
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,870
And like you know like would be nice if we just sort of automatically reset it for the user once the

579
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,120
timer counted down.

580
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,470
So essentially what we want to do is we want to run all this code whenever the timer runs out.

581
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:47,040
So what we can do is just make yet again a another method here so public void and we'll just call this

582
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,830
reset timer.

583
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,620
OK.

584
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:56,520
And this method will just go ahead and copy all of this or cut rather and then will just go ahead and

585
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:04,980
simply call timer excuse me reset timer is the one that we want and we can call the same reset timer

586
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,850
whenever our timer actually finishes.

587
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:11,520
So you know we go ahead and we play the sound and then we also reset the timer.

588
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,260
So let's run this.

589
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,950
Make sure it's exactly what we were hoping for.

590
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:25,590
And here it comes let's go down to a smaller time so we can see that.

591
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:33,180
Here comes the egg done three to one.

592
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,110
We'll get that resets the timer for us you know we're back.

593
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,500
The user can move this around if they want to.

594
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,010
Excellent stuff.

595
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,920
So congrats on creating this egg timer app.

596
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,700
You know we kind of pulled an even more concepts that we've previous learned bunched them all together.

597
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,350
We're just going to keep doing that in this course so we're not completely done with timers yet you'll

598
00:38:54,350 --> 00:39:00,960
see it come along here in just a second but still got more info for you so let's keep moving forward.
