00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.610
So now we're going to move on from our animations and connect through games to see how we can embed

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.300
video in our apps.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.740
It's actually really easy to do.

4
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.310
So let's start with a new project with a cool video demo.

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.410
Set it up in the usual way.

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.190
And while that setting up you will need a video to use in your apps so maybe you've got an MP for file

7
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.870
to hand.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.280
But if not you can just go to Android of course dot com forward slash demo video or MP 4 and depending

9
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.250
on which browser you have it will start downloading or start playing if it plays then just control click

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.040
or right click and download video and that will then download the video to your computer so you can

11
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.100
use it in the app but any video that you can find will work.

12
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.560
OK.

13
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.530
Now we need to put the video into the app and to do that we need to create a new folder within the resources

14
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.540
folder.

15
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.270
So the easiest way to do that I think is to control click on the Mac or right click on PC and reveal

16
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:28.890
in Finder or Windows Explorer and then just in the normal way that you would create a folder had a new

17
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.970
folder called rawe and this is going to be where we put our video content.

18
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.260
So once you've added that new folder find the demo video that you've just downloaded and drag it in

19
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.260
there we get to the videos.

20
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.770
Now there we just need to refresh Oh sometimes it does it itself very helpfully.

21
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.320
If it doesn't then you just need to control click or right click and synchronize raise.

22
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.830
All right.

23
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.020
Now we've got our video.

24
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.450
We just need to add the facility to play it.

25
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:22.240
So let's add a video player in the main activity layout so will do a search and you can see we've got

26
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.400
something very helpfully called Video view.

27
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.860
That sounds pretty promising.

28
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.210
So we'll bring it in and we'll make it full screen

29
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:46.530
stretched to the edge and then we need to know is it id which is of course video view.

30
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.390
All right.

31
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.100
So now we just need to write a code to attach the video to the video view.

32
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.120
We'll do that in the on create method because we want this to be attached and play as soon as we open

33
00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.300
the app.

34
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:10.210
And as usual we'll create that element with the class that we want say video view cool video view and

35
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.790
we'll use find view by ID

36
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.000
or ID top video.

37
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.070
And we'll do the casting even though it's not strictly required above API 26.

38
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:40.910
The next we need to set the path of the video that we want to use with avideo Ivy say video of you don't

39
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.580
set video path and then we need to get this exactly right.

40
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:59.030
So as a string we start off with Android dot resource and then curl on double slash.

41
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.810
That's a bit like HTP the slash as you would use for an internet address but this says that we're going

42
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:14.240
to look inside the Android resources area and then we want to access our resource area for this particular

43
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.130
app.

44
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.020
So we add the package name

45
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.540
to how video path.

46
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:33.320
And then we just need to add a slash in there and then we had the file name which is stored in our top

47
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.650
row dot demo video.

48
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:48.230
So that's how you access resources that are stored in the file structure of your app and then very simply

49
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:58.970
we use video view start three lines of code and we've got a video up and running in our app.

50
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.320
Let's take a look and there it is.

51
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.340
You can see in the new Android Studio 3 it actually plays much smoother in the emulator than it did

52
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.610
invention to excellent.

53
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.320
So now we've got video up and running but you may have noticed that there were no controls on that video

54
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.090
so that might be what you want if you want to force your users to watch her particular video but normally

55
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.780
you're going to want to give them controls to pause and seek back and forth et cetera.

56
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.600
So to do that we bring in a media controller.

57
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:51.420
We call it media control and it's going to be a new media control the and we just have to define the

58
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.850
context of the media controller which as usual is this app which we use the key word this to refer to

59
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.510
and then we just need to link that up to our video.

60
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:14.560
So media control got set anchor view we want to anchor it to our video of you.

61
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.930
And then finally we want to allow that to control our video view.

62
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:29.080
So we use video of you don't set media controller and the media control what does it is the media control

63
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.180
we've just created.

64
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.070
All right let's take a look.

65
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.810
So we should now be able to say via video but also control it.

66
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.090
And there you go.

67
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.080
So we can now pause seek back and forth et cetera.

68
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.050
So super easy.

69
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.760
That's how you add video to your app.

70
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.730
In just five lines of code now we're going to jump straight on to see how we do the same thing with

71
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.520
audio.
