00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,590
All right welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,940
This is going to be a really quick one but before we move forward to our news reader app there's one

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,160
more skill that we've got to learn and that is web views that basically allows you to add Web sites

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,140
into your app full native web sites and it's just going to make it that much easier when someone finds

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,310
a news article that they like that they could look at with in your look at it in your app without having

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,500
to move over into their browser.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:30,700
So what we're going to do is just create a new Android studio project or simply call it web views.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,450
And we just want default for everything here.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:40,330
So again the idea is basically that you can create this little web view inside of your app you tell

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,620
it what Web so you want to go to or we could pass it our own custom each email.

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,150
Either way that you want to work it.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,800
This is going to allow us to display something from the web.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,190
So let's go ahead and move first to the visual side of things.

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:00,550
We just want to drag in a web view into crap and make sure that it sort of fills up the whole screen

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:00,920
here.

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,900
So we'll go ahead and give Android studio just a second here to get up and running.

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,690
So once that finally opened up let's go ahead and get rid of this text.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,240
Phew.

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,340
Go ahead and delete that.

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,670
And if we go down to our containers there you can see there's a web view.

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,130
We'll go ahead and drag this into the project and again looks like it's filled up most the space all

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,950
just stuff those constraints to make sure that's the case.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,800
And let's give it a proper ID like a lot of new web web view.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,120
There we go.

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,720
So we've gone ahead and we've done that.

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,320
Let's go ahead and move to our main activity and talk about how we can get this filled with the information

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,100
for a web site.

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,290
So before we move into that I guess we let's go ahead and do this because the Web is going to be accessing

29
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:44,800
the Internet.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,960
We've have to ask for that permission.

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,020
So open up your Android manifest file and like we've done before you want to do are uses permission

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,110
and we're looking for the Internet.

33
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,220
So we'll go ahead and put that in and that's all we need to do with that.

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,500
So go ahead x that out then back inside of our main activity first let's get access to our web view

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:17,470
or say capital web view and we'll just name it web view here is equal to find view by id our DOT ID

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,860
dot would view.

37
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,130
Excellent.

38
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:27,940
Once we have access to that particular web view then we want to put a little a few settings on there

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,880
so the first one is about whether javascript is enabled or not.

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,610
So Javascript is a separate language from Java that allows you to do more interactive things on the

41
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,170
Web sites.

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:44,470
Almost every Web site these days now uses Javascript so we need to say on our Web view Web site get

43
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:52,840
settings and then on those settings we're going to say that set javascript enabled and we want to go

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,810
ahead and pass True into here.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,190
Because if you put false inside of here a lot of Web sites are just going to flat out not work.

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,030
Now there are some situations you would want to do this would be more particularly if you want to have

47
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,160
more control of what the user can and can't do.

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,920
But in this case let's just have it equal to true next step for us is we need to say that we want this

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,460
to open on our app.

50
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,330
So I'll just show you this line of code and talk about it.

51
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:25,570
So when you dot set web view client and inside of here we're going to pass new capital web view client.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,120
So the basic idea here is if you do not provide this information a new web view client it'll just say

53
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,180
oh I'll go find the default default browser on the user's phone whether it's chrome opera or whatever

54
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,370
it is Firefox it'll go launch that up.

55
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,390
And so in this you're saying no no I want you to open things up here inside of this web view.

56
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,560
And that's what that web View client is all about.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,960
Then it simply let me go ahead and get the emulator up and running here so that I know that will take

58
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,140
a second there.

59
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,720
Then we want to go ahead and get our web view and we want to give it a you Arel that we want it to go

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,160
load.

61
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,180
So we're going to say load your l.

62
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,720
And here we just simply pass it a string.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:15,370
So with this make sure you give it the full HTP colon slash slash you Colon slash last WKOW dot and

64
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,590
then some website.

65
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,980
Let's go ahead and do like Google dot com.

66
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,580
OK.

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,160
We'll go ahead and put that in there.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,600
And now our Web view should display that Web site to us.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:35,510
So let's go ahead and run this on our emulator cable hit that run button and we'll give this a moment

70
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,630
to pop up here.

71
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,290
OK.

72
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,110
So here comes the app and look get that all of a sudden it shows up.

73
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,060
It's the fully functioning Google dot com.

74
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,070
So for example here you could go ahead and search for something like If I'm a big BYU fan so I want

75
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,970
to I want to say like you I you score to find out if they won or not.

76
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,620
And look it shows the recent football games in Bewley football stinks right now so maybe they actually

77
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,680
don't want to see these results.

78
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,460
But it's a fully functioning Web site and it doesn't have to be Gool you could go put your home page

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,450
in there in your favorite place that you like to go visit whatever.

80
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,840
One more thing I'd like to show you is you can actually load raw HDMI all into a web view.

81
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,740
So for example if we take a web view and we say Dot load data so let's select not load your all we want

82
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,770
to load data.

83
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,720
You can provide a string with some email like you would have for web site so for example let's do an

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,300
opening H.T. mail tag which then means we should have an ending age e-mail tag if you don't know how

85
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,590
to work with H.E. mail there's some tutorials we don't really have to get into it for this to work.

86
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,410
I'm just showing a quick example you can copy my text exactly if you'd like with this then we've got

87
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,720
to have a body opening tag.

88
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,760
And then which means we should have an ending body tag then inside of there.

89
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,760
We could go ahead and put like a one tag and say something like Hello world.

90
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,880
Exclamation point and then we'll do our ending.

91
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:17,150
Page one tag and maybe after this we could add a paragraph where we say something like this is a cool

92
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,640
word website summation point and then we'll do our ending tag there.

93
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,000
So you put in all that H.T. mail then you've got to provide a few more things so the next thing is you

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,610
got to say what type this is coming through.

95
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:37,170
So for H.M.S. you do text slash HVM L and then the last thing that you need to provide here is the encoding

96
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,680
that you want.

97
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,730
So we're going to use the standard UTF all caps the Dash 8 case if we've done all of this make sure

98
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,620
you got your semi-colon.

99
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,750
It's going to load this little T.M. string that we created into the browser as a web view.

100
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:59,700
And so let's go and get our emulator here opens up and boom look at hello world.

101
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:06,750
This is my cool web site so you will see this low data use for example some people create apps that

102
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,080
are completely just a web view of some HCM shellcode and they do this so that they can make their app

103
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,950
work on iOS and Android or Windows Phone whatever new thing comes out.

104
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,710
They can all just use the web browser inside of it to kind of.

105
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,550
So they don't have to repeat stuff.

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,660
But to me it's always a little bit cheesy because it's like you know early on here you know how to do

107
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,730
native code like roll with that go make a native app that people really enjoy.

108
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,990
But it is an option there.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,400
So I wanted to you know show you what that was all about.

110
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,050
OK.

111
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,240
Now that you have this skill in your tool will you are now ready to move forward and create the news

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,080
feed app let's go do it.
