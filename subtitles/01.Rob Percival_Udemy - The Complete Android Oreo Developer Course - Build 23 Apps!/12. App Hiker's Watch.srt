00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,500
Hello and welcome to the section we're we're going to be building an app called hiker's watch.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,560
So the basic idea this app is if you're someone who loves to hike explore you can open up this app and

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,160
without tapping any buttons this is the real magic of this you just open it up and it will tell you

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,620
what your latitude longitude is how accurate the GPS is at the current moment what your current altitude

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,290
is and what the address is for the place that you are in.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,660
So for example I put in a new location I'm going to try and get us back to New York.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,420
I go ahead and hit send here and boom.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,420
All sudden we're on 16th Street in New York and I've listed out the zip code the state the street address

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,600
just all sorts of awesome stuff there.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,110
So this is the app that I want you to build.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,820
One thing that you may notice is we are full screen here.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,350
We don't even have that little bar at the top and we've got an image filling up the whole things you're

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,600
going have to figure out how to do that.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,470
Awesome Web site to go get images on Splash dot com I've mentioned before but just wanted you to know.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,400
Great place to go get those.

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,470
And yeah you should have all the know how to do this right.

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,760
This is our geo location.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,640
This is working with location objects and stuff.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,450
So go ahead try and tackle this yourself.

20
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,490
I really believe that you can do this on without any of my help.

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,590
But if you need anything or you just want to see how I did it you can always move forward.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,060
OK.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,260
So go ahead and attack it now.

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,390
All right let's go ahead and get started here.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,790
We're going to start a new Android project and we're going to go ahead and call this hiker's watch.

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,670
Again I would avoid the apostrophe there because you don't want to come through with that messing up

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,240
anything.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,930
So let's go ahead and hit next on this one at least API 23 and we'll just do the empty activity because

29
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,160
we're not showing maps in this one.

30
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,910
And then we'll go ahead and hit finish here.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,590
So while this is going we want to have that nice full screen image for our app.

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,880
So let's go ahead and go here to splash.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,270
Lots of different pictures here that you could use for your app.

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,680
Just go ahead and kind of pick one that you think looks nice.

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,050
I like this one of sort of the stars out at night.

36
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,990
It's got that camping tent there you can decide whether or not you know this is the right picture for

37
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,950
you but I'm going to go ahead and download this one can.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,370
And go ahead and minimize that.

39
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:24,230
And look we've got this awesome picture so I'm probably going to crop this a little bit so oops I mean

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,540
to rotate like that.

41
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,060
So I want to see my tools here where are those.

42
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,570
Here we go.

43
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,240
So I just want to make this a little bit smaller I'm going to take like a nice chunk of the galaxy here

44
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,240
maybe I'll just have it even be all stars like that.

45
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:49,740
But get a nice swatch of that or crop it and then I'm going to go ahead and export this to my desktop

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,010
and I'm going to call this the sky and we'll go ahead and do that.

47
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,480
Save one more thing that we do want to add it here.

48
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,420
We want to adjust the size.

49
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,250
I'm going to bring this down to room.

50
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,170
Let's maybe do like 500 with you know we might want to do a little bit more than that.

51
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,380
I mean let's do like a seven hundred and we'll go ahead and say OK there and then we'll save file export

52
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,130
or this puppy on the desktop again.

53
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,390
But I just want to call it sky replace that other one.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,470
Great.

55
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,570
Now that we've got that let's go ahead and exit out of there and we'll come into.

56
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,810
So the first thing that I want to dive into is that if we want this to be a full screen app we've got

57
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,630
to go to our Android manifest here and rather than do this style app theme where we have the little

58
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:52,260
bar at the top and all that stuff we want to go ahead and change this to style slash theme at compact

59
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,010
dot and there's all sorts of different options here.

60
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,640
But we want to go ahead and choose the no action bar.

61
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,870
So we'll go ahead and pick that one.

62
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,810
And this is a basically allows our app to go full screen.

63
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,830
So that's kind of the first quick thing that we want to fix here.

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,690
Let's go ahead and work about the work on the visual side of our app so go ahead and make some space

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:18,990
for us to move around in and give Android studio a second here to launch up.

66
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,180
We do want to get rid of this text view.

67
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,360
So I'll go ahead and delete that.

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,750
Next we're looking for image view that's going to fill the entire screen so go ahead pull out an image

69
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,640
and it's going to ask you which image that you want and be nice to just pass this.

70
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,500
So let's go ahead and before we do that we'll open up our file system and inside of a bowl.

71
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:51,250
All right click this and say reveal and finder J once we have that open up drawable and open up in a

72
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,780
new tab our desktop folders do command to to get that.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,280
And here we've got our sky.

74
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:02,910
I can copy this and then paste this here into drawable And let's see if we can get that show up.

75
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,580
There it goes.

76
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,260
Just to confirm here I'm going to do synchronize selected files.

77
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,200
Looks good.

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,250
So now that we have that in place if I want to bring out an image view it's going to ask me hey what

79
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,670
do you want.

80
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,200
And I'm going to choose this guy.

81
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,740
So there we go that's looking pretty good.

82
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:27,490
Now one thing that we want to do first is just make sure this goes edged edge so we'll add in these

83
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:27,990
constraints.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,350
But just make sure you've got zero for each of them.

85
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,160
So there is zero there there is zero and there's zero.

86
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,820
So we can see from this right side that it's touching all the edges but it's not exactly filling the

87
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,900
whole screen.

88
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,360
So what we want to do here is we want to go change the scale type.

89
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,250
And again lots of different options here.

90
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,180
My favorite tends to be centered crop.

91
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,450
So let's go ahead and pick that one.

92
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,250
OK.

93
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:00,670
I want to make sure that this actually fills up the entire screen so we'll go ahead and fire up our

94
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,610
emulator here while we're doing a little bit more.

95
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,660
The next step for us while we're waiting for that to load is we want to have a nice title here that

96
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,400
shows that this is the hikers watch and then we want to start listing out some information here like

97
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,860
the latitude and longitude.

98
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,620
So what we need to do first is go ahead and grab a text for you.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,340
We'll bring that down right in the middle.

100
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:31,600
In fact let's right click this and say you should be centered horizontally and we'll have you be a certain

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
distance from the top there.

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,710
And we have lost our image of you here.

103
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:45,280
Let's go ahead and do a control Z with that looks like maybe our better solution here is we're going

104
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,090
to select this text for you and we're just going to do a controlled drug.

105
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,520
We want the next few here.

106
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,370
There we go and I just want to button up top and I'm going to drag it to the edge there.

107
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,820
That gives me that nice distance.

108
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,460
Now I think eight is too close.

109
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,500
Maybe see something like 20.

110
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,170
If that gives us a little more space on that seam seems better.

111
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,130
We'll talk more if there is something that we can change looks like that emulator opened up.

112
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,590
Ooh look at that.

113
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,240
It's looking really cool.

114
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,430
I love how that looks.

115
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:25,050
So because this is a dark background we want to make sure that our text here is a light color so go

116
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:33,870
ahead and switch to the advanced attributes roll down to where we can change the text color and let's

117
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,840
make sure we have the text few selected here come down and select text color.

118
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,460
Here we go.

119
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,790
So change changes to be background light or something white.

120
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,470
Right so we can see this.

121
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,770
We also want to change the text size Let's see what 40 looks like.

122
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,140
Yeah I think this could be pretty good.

123
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:58,340
And let's go ahead and change this to say hiker's watch can.

124
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,370
So we've got that in place now we need to go ahead and create some text labels that are text views that

125
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,310
are going to show the latitude and longitude.

126
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,150
So we'll go ahead and grab some more text use here.

127
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,450
And we'll bring out this one first.

128
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:26,430
So again we want to go put some attributes here so text size maybe see what 20 looks like.

129
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,710
The big one here this text color we've got to make sure this is nice and light so we can even read the

130
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:40,190
text and then we'll go ahead and give this something so might say latitude and put like something 40

131
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,250
point blah blah blah.

132
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,390
Who knows.

133
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,450
Right.

134
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,760
Let's go ahead and have this be a certain distance from hiker's watch here.

135
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,490
It's going to go ahead and put that.

136
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,940
We wanted to be a certain distance from the left.

137
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,880
Looks like we're going to do this visually so we'll go ahead and grab that.

138
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:04,290
And it gets too close the idea of going to see what 20 looks like for spacing seem seems pretty good.

139
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,310
I'm also going to bump up the space in as well let's see what.

140
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,960
Something like 30 looks like that should give us a good distance.

141
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,870
OK.

142
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:17,640
So once we have that in place we can actually go ahead and copy this text view and paste it because

143
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,810
we want one a similar size and text color right.

144
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,190
So with text views three selected Let's go ahead and drag that down.

145
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:31,350
We'll bring in a little bit below and we want to get rid of the top constraint there instead grab this

146
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,030
and bring it to our friend there.

147
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:42,970
We want to bump up the size to be 20 and we want the spacing on the left side to be 20 as well.

148
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,120
OK so that looks pretty good.

149
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,740
And so this one being latitude we want it to be longit Tud.

150
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,260
Excellent.

151
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,690
And now we've got that in place.

152
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,560
OK so this is a fairly solid start of where we're trying to get to.

153
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,380
We're going to have to go through and connected these to our code but we'll come back to that in just

154
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,510
a second.

155
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,720
One thing that we want to do before we forget and that's that we need to make sure we get the correct

156
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,230
use permission here so instead use permission we want to get the fine location and we'll just go ahead

157
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,830
and handle that to make sure we don't forget it.

158
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,010
Something just popped in my head and I thought you know what we should do that before we run into any

159
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,830
issues inside the set.

160
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,000
All right so let's get back to our main activity and start writing all our location code.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,200
And you should be an absolute pro by now by this and if you want to you feel free to copy and paste

162
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,280
from a different project.

163
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,760
But what we're going to do here is we're going to create our location manager like we've done before

164
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,120
and we're going to create a lake location listener that we'll call location Lester.

165
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,660
So we'll go ahead and set those two up.

166
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:57,570
And then inside of our on Create this is where we want to get these all set up so we'll say we first

167
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:08,980
want to set up our location manager say this is equal to this dot get system service and the service

168
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:17,190
that we're looking for is context that location service great.

169
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,560
So remember we've always got to cast this.

170
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:26,360
So I'll go ahead and say that this is going to be a location manager once we have that in place.

171
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,400
The next step for us is we want to set up the location listener and again you should be like Come on

172
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,890
Nick I already know this stuff and feel free if you can go faster than me.

173
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,140
Go ahead.

174
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,010
Set this out.

175
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,040
You're going to do great.

176
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
We just need to go ahead and get this stuff set up.

177
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,850
So for simple version right now let's just go ahead The only thing that we want to do is on location

178
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,060
changed.

179
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:57,490
We want to log some information so let's say a log that high and we want to say location and then we're

180
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,280
going to go ahead and pass in that location object right there and make sure we do two strings so we

181
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,780
can read the info from it.

182
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,320
OK.

183
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,550
So once we've got that all finished we then got to go do our classic opener.

184
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,310
Forget the semi-colon there.

185
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:20,800
Where we go ahead and try and get access and see you know hey are they able to you know has the user

186
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,700
given us permission.

187
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,150
If not we need to go request.

188
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,460
Right that's sort of the big thing that we're looking for here.

189
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,580
So we're going to set up an if statement.

190
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,100
Nice old curly brackets.

191
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,360
And so the first big thing is we got to check if we have permission.

192
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:43,600
So going to say context compact compact dot check self permission and the permission that we're looking

193
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:57,760
for is we're going to say this comma manifest dot permission thought access fine location excellent.

194
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:05,850
So we're going to make sure that this does not equal and we go want to go ahead and check package manager

195
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,370
permission granted.

196
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,000
So if the permission is not granted that's when we're worried and we're going to do something about

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,160
it.

198
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,870
OK.

199
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,650
And so if that is not the case then we need to go ask for that permission.

200
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:28,890
So we're going to say activity compact compact dot request permissions and inside of here we're going

201
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,730
to say this now we're going to do a new String Array.

202
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,970
And with this inside of some curly brackets Curly.

203
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,220
There we go.

204
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:49,870
We are going to say capital manifest permission got access fine location.

205
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,660
There we go.

206
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,250
So that's going to go ahead and ask for that information.

207
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,980
OK.

208
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,370
Then after that oh we're missing one here.

209
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,210
That's why it's yelling at us we have to put a proper tag in there request code excuse me.

210
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,480
So once we've done that this is you know if we didn't get permission if we do have permission that's

211
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,260
the ELTs part of this equation.

212
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,970
Then we just want to go ahead and move forward with what we got going.

213
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:22,250
So for example the location manager want to access this and say OK let's go request location updates

214
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:31,040
and to get this role and will first pass in the location manager dot CPS provider and then we'll just

215
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,110
do zero and zero.

216
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,650
So we want all the info and then we're going to pass in a location.

217
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,740
Lester are we though.

218
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,370
OK.

219
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,490
There we go.

220
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,900
Finally did that then the next step for us is we want to get the last known location.

221
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,140
Right so this is in case the app opens for the first time they've already given us permission.

222
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,810
We've got to figure out what the last location wants so we'll say last known location

223
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,440
location.

224
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,080
There we go.

225
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:11,960
Is equal to location manager dot get last known location and inside of here again we're going to do

226
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,230
our location manager dot GPS provider to get that good stuff.

227
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,520
So once we've got this in place and let's see why we are upset here.

228
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:31,700
Require location manager film location.

229
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,220
That's because we should not be setting up a location manager We're setting up a location that was my

230
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,050
mistake there.

231
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,570
All right so now with that in place we can go ahead and we want to go ahead and see if location is known

232
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,540
or not.

233
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:56,180
So I say if curly brackets all check and see if location last known location that is is not equal to.

234
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,190
No.

235
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,120
Then we want to go ahead and you know update some information but rather than just go ahead and type

236
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,050
this here we're going to go ahead and make our own function that says update location information.

237
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,270
So let's go up to the top here.

238
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,280
I guess not above the street.

239
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,640
I'm going to try and start keeping concrete up at the top I feel like that's a good practice.

240
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:28,060
So I'm going to make a new public void function that I'm going to call update location

241
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:39,080
info and with this we need to be able to pass in a location that will just call location and then we'll

242
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,770
go ahead and have our curly brackets there.

243
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:47,060
So then inside of this function this is where we're going to call update location info.

244
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,640
We're going to pass in the last known location.

245
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:56,000
So then it's up to this function to then go ahead and write log out some information or do whatever

246
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,230
it is that we think is best.

247
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,700
And in this case I think we should just log out the information for the time being sort of say log.

248
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:11,930
I will say location and we'll go ahead and pass this location dot to street so that we can have a sense

249
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,180
of what's going on there.

250
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,490
So of course this is the first part of the equation which also got to respond for what happens when

251
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,980
someone actually is able to say yes or no to the permissions.

252
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:32,120
So we'll go ahead and put that above here and this is going to be on request permission result.

253
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,960
Remember when this gets called Whenever someone says yes or no to one of the permissions that we've

254
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,200
asked for so we're going to do a cool little statement here where we just say All right first thing

255
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:50,360
that we want to check and see is if we were able to successfully get the grant results and check that

256
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,090
and see if the length is greater than zero.

257
00:17:53,420 --> 00:18:03,260
And we also want to check and see if Grant results the first object inside of there is equal to the

258
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,100
package manager got permission granted.

259
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,510
So if we get this this means that we've we've got that info right and then we'd want to go about you

260
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,910
know basically the same code that we had of the.

261
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,890
Right here where we go requesting for information.

262
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,580
Now what we have to do is you know do this check because remember if we just go ahead and copy this

263
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,110
line of code it's totally fine.

264
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,180
Let's get to the end of this.

265
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:39,400
So we have this line of code copy that say OK if we got permission we'll go ahead and do this.

266
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,410
The problem is this needs that one more if statement there.

267
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,580
And this is kind of code that's going to happen over and over again.

268
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:53,510
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this line of code I'm going to copy it this way it seems

269
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,000
to move faster here.

270
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,300
So I'm going to copy this and go ahead and paste that there.

271
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,100
And we've got to make sure we put an ending curly bracket on it.

272
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,670
Good.

273
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,510
And we've got to make sure that we change this to equals because we're saying OK if we were able to

274
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,960
get permission then go ahead and do this request thing.

275
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,310
We're going to go ahead and just put this inside of its own function.

276
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:31,330
So we'll just go ahead here and say public void and we're going to call this start listening it won't

277
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,740
take in any parameters but it's simply just going to do this code right here.

278
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,010
Right.

279
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,710
We check make sure that we have permission and if we do we're going to start requesting that information.

280
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:49,120
And so we'll just put start listening right here and that will solve the problem for us rather than

281
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,270
have to always type that every single time that we want to know about the information.

282
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:01,200
OK so now that we've got this in place what we're going to do is go ahead and give this a test.

283
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,750
See if we can get some of this information showing up for us.

284
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,250
So we'll wait for the emulator here.

285
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:23,080
And look at that finished up and see this popping up in a moment there we go ooh I love color so I'll

286
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,710
go ahead and say allow.

287
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:30,240
And that was the first time I was able to hit allow and actually just start into the app and mean to

288
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,170
do that for a while.

289
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,980
OK.

290
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,490
So what we're going to do down here is now that we've got Lague had open we're going to go back to the

291
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,250
emulator and we'll go ahead and hit the send button here.

292
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,660
So when we go back to log cat look at that it's showing latitude longitude but there's also some other

293
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,460
cool information here showing the accuracy it's showing the altitude.

294
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,390
Now this altitude is just one that we can manually send through the emulator.

295
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,930
So it's not like it goes and looks up the location gets the altitude and sends it back.

296
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:07,180
So if I put in 64 here and I send this we come back and we can look oh look the altitudes 64 and I found

297
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,740
this out because I kept changing my location all around the world and I was like how was there not altitude.

298
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,950
Like I put it on Everest.

299
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,910
I put in the exact locations for Everest and I was still getting zero and I just thought This is insane

300
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:24,690
and then I realized oh you can manually enter the altitude that's how you do this let's you know if

301
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,310
we don't do 645.

302
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,580
Oh that's totally possible right there.

303
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,570
So those are the next two pieces of information that we want to add.

304
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:37,390
Is the accuracy and the altitude we want to add those things and then we're going to move into the reverse

305
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:44,700
geotagging where we actually go through and add right like what the address is for this specific place.

306
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:51,550
So let's go back to the design view here or X-amount This is where we're going to finish off all of

307
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,520
our visual things.

308
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,160
So let's go ahead and grab text you three.

309
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,650
We're going to copy and paste that.

310
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,380
Now we should have a text view for let's bring that down.

311
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,310
So a couple of fixes you're going to get rid of the top one and move it.

312
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,710
So it's just connecting those two and we're going to change that to 20.

313
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:18,910
And also it's left constraint 220 and a set of longitude.

314
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:26,490
This is going to tell us if I can go and change the text here let's see text 4 right.

315
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,330
Yes.

316
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,590
So instead of longitude we are going to put in accuracy.

317
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,750
OK.

318
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,820
I mean that's not going to have a big decimal behind it.

319
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,350
And then let's go ahead and copy text you sure should give us a text for you 5.

320
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,690
There we go.

321
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:51,100
We want to move this guy down as well except with this one let's get rid of its top and connect it like

322
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,940
this and change its constraints to say 20 and 20 here.

323
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,450
And this one rather than accuracy.

324
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,890
This is going to tell us about the altitude.

325
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,280
All right.

326
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,560
And then the very last thing that we want to add here is we want to go ahead and add a place for the

327
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,500
address again.

328
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:22,850
Let's just copy one of these text fuse paste about drag one down get rid of its top and connect the

329
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,400
two there.

330
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:30,360
And let's be consistent we'll say 20 and 20.

331
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,090
Now with this one we've got to be a little bit careful because we want to say something like address

332
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,730
and then we want to go ahead and do a new line.

333
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,270
And then it's on that New Line where we're going to start sharing some information.

334
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,020
So we just got to make sure that this can handle it.

335
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:54,550
So let's go ahead and say you know we had an address like 40 street Boulevard and then we do a new line

336
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:02,660
and then we say somewhere Kansas like that.

337
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,320
OK.

338
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,810
So if we go ahead and do that.

339
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,420
Oh look.

340
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,190
That's a that's a beautiful address.

341
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,170
OK.

342
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,380
So that came through.

343
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,850
That's looking awesome.

344
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:16,640
We want to go ahead and add some proper text view ID's here so that we can access these things.

345
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,300
So to kind of make this a little bit quick I'm going to cop type out capital Tech's view and I'm going

346
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,910
to copy this.

347
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,110
So then I can just put names really quickly in front of your so I'm just going to say Latt text you

348
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,220
for this one.

349
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,110
And yes go ahead and update this.

350
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,940
I call this number three.

351
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,990
And I call this long the longitude text view.

352
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,070
Go ahead and enter that I say just say yes to all these.

353
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,430
OK so for this one this is our accuracy Tech's view.

354
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:56,020
Go ahead and put that in or else to do alt text you.

355
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,160
Excellent.

356
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,850
And then this one will be our address view excellent.

357
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,360
So now we can have the proper codes so that we can go ahead and actually get access to those different

358
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,850
pieces of information.

359
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:15,290
So let's go back to our code here and talk about where we need to move next.

360
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:21,650
So whenever we are going to get some information about the user's location it's going to be called here

361
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,080
in this update location info.

362
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,370
Right.

363
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:31,670
Because we're going to come here in fact on this location change you want to change this to update location

364
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,270
info.

365
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,060
OK.

366
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,450
We're going to pass at that location.

367
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,730
So this is sort of our real moneymaker.

368
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,350
This is where we want to make sure we just go through and update everything here.

369
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,800
So we need to get access to all those text views.

370
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,830
So what we're going to do is just type them all out right here so we're going to say capital Tech's

371
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,960
view and I'm going to call this one.

372
00:25:53,060 --> 00:26:03,300
Start first with the lat text view I will say this is equal to fine view by the Capitol our ID lat text

373
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:11,190
you beautiful and we just want to copy this and paste for the next five that we need here.

374
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,020
OK.

375
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:19,340
So for this one this is going to be the long text view like that so we'll change this to say a long

376
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,390
text view.

377
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:31,990
This one is going to be the accuracy text us soldiers change to a CC.

378
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,340
This should be Allt.

379
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,840
I'll change that to be on that last one.

380
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,790
Is it going to be our address text for you.

381
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,380
So then we can change this to address textfield.

382
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,540
All right so now that we have access to each of those we just have to go about the business of sort

383
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,580
of updating all of these with the appropriate text and it's actually quite straightforward here.

384
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:05,080
I'm impressed with how is handled this so for example let's start with the last text view.

385
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,350
We're going to set the text there.

386
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,380
OK.

387
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,990
So with this we want to have one string that's going to say you know we want to set the latitude and

388
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,380
do our little call with a space and then we want to add on a string of whatever the latitude is.

389
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:29,960
So use this location object or one parameter here and we do dot get latitude just that easy and all

390
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:41,650
say Dot to a string it to string let's see is that I mean if get latitude is a string then we'll be

391
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,120
OK.

392
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,130
No it gives us a double.

393
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,450
So we're going to have to do some conversion there.

394
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:57,790
So go ahead and say double that to string and we can pass in this double.

395
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,190
All right.

396
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:08,200
And I forgot I deleted the location so we got to do location get latitude and that'll go ahead and convert

397
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,000
it into a string and then we can go ahead and put that there.

398
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,810
So looks like we're missing and in parentheses.

399
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:16,940
Great.

400
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,920
So let's go ahead and first test this.

401
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,380
Just one make sure that we're getting to the correct place here.

402
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:28,060
Right so we'll have our app fired up here and I just want to see that this works and if it does then

403
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,000
we can go rapid fire on the next pieces of information here.

404
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:37,660
Then we're going to go into reverse geocoding the address but that's going to come soon enough.

405
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,070
So let's just confirm that this part is working right now.

406
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:48,370
So let's go ahead and send some information and we sent a latitude of forty point seven so let's try

407
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,400
like 40 points 6 6.

408
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,820
Go ahead and do that and look at that.

409
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,730
It came through there.

410
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,850
So that's great.

411
00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:01,390
You can see it's slightly off like I did 40 points 6 6 and it had 40 points 6 5 9 9 9 8 whatever right.

412
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,270
So kind of interesting the different details that you get there.

413
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,710
But then we're going to go ahead and just rapid fire this for the next three.

414
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,130
So of course these are going to be a little bit different.

415
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,100
So this is going to be our longitude Tech's view.

416
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,370
This is going to be our accuracy.

417
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,450
You and I'm realizing that shouldn't be a C A C It's a c c.

418
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,470
Like go ahead and update that.

419
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,050
And this last one here.

420
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,940
This is the altitude text you.

421
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:36,250
So for this one very simple we just got to get longitude no issues there and you'd be surprised.

422
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,760
It's about the same for all.

423
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,400
So we're just going to say get accuracy like we get that.

424
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,690
And for our last one here we'll do get altitude and we'll go ahead and get that information.

425
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,200
So let's go ahead and give that a run make sure this is working.

426
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,950
And then if we do that really the only thing standing in our way is being able to update the address.

427
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,780
So you should have an emulator now.

428
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,820
Let's go ahead and update some information and change this altitude to be like five or something like

429
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,030
that and boom look at updates that if you're wondering why it shows up the first time.

430
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,160
That's because we have the code to automatically update that.

431
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:20,520
Right but if I change this to be one point six six bam it can automatically change all that.

432
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,710
So we're looking really good really just the last thing that we need to do is work on this address and

433
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,940
accidently put some breakpoints there if you ever put those you just click on it click again it's going

434
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,220
to go away.

435
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,660
So it's time to now work with the address so remember this is where we kind of have to do some reverse

436
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,170
engineering here.

437
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:44,530
So first thing is we're going to make a string that I'm simply just going to call the address.

438
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,070
All right.

439
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:54,910
And this is initially just going to be equal to some sort of warning like could not find address frowny

440
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,330
face.

441
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,810
This is kind of our warning message in case things don't go right.

442
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,950
We want to have access to that there.

443
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,270
But then the next thing that we're going to do is over time compile an address and then update our text

444
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,400
view with that.

445
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:15,010
So first thing that we need to do is get information from a geocoder which then means we need to create

446
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,450
a geocoder.

447
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:25,750
So we're going to say geocoder I think quite naturally we'll call that geocoder is equal to a new geocoder

448
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,320
just like that.

449
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:33,310
And we have to pass it a context so we're going to go ahead and say this the locale are going to go

450
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:39,990
ahead and say OK now not get the fault.

451
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,460
So then I'll give us that next thing that we need to do here is with this geocoder we need to go get

452
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,050
some address this or we're going to say first we're going to pass this into a list.

453
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,930
So let's just go ahead and get that set up now.

454
00:31:51,970 --> 00:32:01,900
Is going to be a list of addresses so a list of addresses that we'll call we'll call this list addresses

455
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:15,520
and we'll go ahead and set this equal to geocoder dot and we want to get the from location and location

456
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:23,090
that we're going to pass as the location at top and we're going to get the latitude and then location

457
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,630
get longitude.

458
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,870
I kind of wish we could almost just pass at a single location and it could do the rest for us.

459
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:38,450
But whatever result we want to go ahead and keep that at one then what we're going to do is a nice statement

460
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:38,690
here.

461
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,880
Now this is code that's got to be surrounded with a try catch So let's go ahead and do that or go down

462
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,880
here to try and end that curly bracket then do a catch.

463
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:59,180
We weren't going to take any exception that we might call the K and then we'll do our DOT print stack

464
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,800
trace in case we get to there.

465
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:07,130
But in case things are working here then what we want to do is a little if statement so we're going

466
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:16,790
to say if we get our curly brackets all right if list addresses is not equal to no.

467
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:27,200
And we actually got something there and do our two Ampere's stamps list addresses get we want to go

468
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:37,550
ahead and get to that position 0 and then we want to check on the size of this so we don't want to get

469
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,110
quite yet.

470
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:45,320
Excuse me we want to do the list addresses that size got ahead of myself and make sure that this is

471
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,760
grade up to zero because then that would tell us there is at least one in there.

472
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:55,070
So if this is the case then what we're going to do is if we have an actual address then we know that

473
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,740
we can get rid of this could not find address stuff.

474
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,660
So we'll go ahead and say address here.

475
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:12,300
You should be equal to a string that says capital address and has a colon and then a new line break.

476
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,870
OK.

477
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,570
So that sort of says all right.

478
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,380
We believe that we're going to get an address now.

479
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,240
Then the next thing that we need to do is we need to go through that process of pulling out all the

480
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,220
individual pieces of an address.

481
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,960
So we had done this before.

482
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,110
Remember we have to do if statements to make sure we're getting what we think we're getting.

483
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,690
So we're going to check first.

484
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,040
We're going to say list addresses that get.

485
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,930
And this is where we want to get the zero object.

486
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,350
And once we have that we're going to you know we have the opportunity to get the different pieces of

487
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,100
information.

488
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:52,370
So if I remember correctly the get thoroughfare gives us the street address so go ahead and grab that

489
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,270
and check if this is not equal to no.

490
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:03,230
So if that is the case then we'll go ahead and add this to our address so we'll say you know address.

491
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,440
That's not our address address plus equals.

492
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:13,340
And this is where we're going to add this right here so this will add the beginning part of the address

493
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:19,760
and once we have this in place we definitely want to add a new line here so we'll just go ahead and

494
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:29,420
put a new line lower case there and then it's just a matter of setting up the other pieces of this address

495
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:36,910
so you know we're going to want to go get stuff like the city name so let's do.

496
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:43,090
In fact I'm just going to copy all of this paste it down below but rather than get thoroughfare we're

497
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:51,740
going to get locality update this one to get locality and we don't want a new line after this one we

498
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:58,430
do want a space though so just make that a space or copy this one more time and we'll paste it out so

499
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:04,160
that we have the state or actually let's do the zip code so we're going to say get.

500
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,150
And I believe that's postal code.

501
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:11,660
There we go get the postal code.

502
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:19,010
Then the last thing that we want to do is get the states all go and put that down and say get I believe

503
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:24,560
that's referenced and get admin there admin area and depending on how you like your addresses you're

504
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,450
going to change up this to fit your needs.

505
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,010
But once you have this all in place you know all set up.

506
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,680
Then it's time for us to take this address and update the address text for you.

507
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:42,410
So we want to make sure that this happens outside of this big IF statement here right because if for

508
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:48,460
some reason we weren't able to get the address right we want to do it outside of all of them.

509
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:56,420
So we're going to go ahead and say address text view that set text and we're going to simply set it

510
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,630
equal to her address.

511
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,390
OK.

512
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,130
So once you've gone ahead and gotten that in place let's go ahead and give us a roll.

513
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,850
This is sort of our big moment of truth here we might have some missing pieces we'll have to come back

514
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,260
and fix.

515
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:13,190
But this should be pretty solid for what we're looking for.

516
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,800
Let's open up the emulator here and look at that.

517
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,760
So we are somewhere random law.

518
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,270
Mark Garrincha some big postal code there.

519
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,380
Let's go ahead and make this something like 50.

520
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,000
See where we are now.

521
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,960
Oh we're in Quebec.

522
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,430
Maybe if we go down we can get to the U.S. and look at that.

523
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,570
We're back in New York.

524
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,600
I mean that's what things that we had before.

525
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,140
So I guess that makes sense.

526
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,090
What happens if we move.

527
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,140
I think that makes us more west.

528
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:42,990
Yeah.

529
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,550
Somewhere in Ohio look at this.

530
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,080
Now we're in Iowa.

531
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,690
Oh my goodness this is so much fun.

532
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,700
Colorado we could probably go one more.

533
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,780
Look at that we're in Utah.

534
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,460
That's where I'm from.

535
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,070
So just keep going.

536
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,710
And there we are in California.

537
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,800
I bet one more this puts us off in the ocean.

538
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,170
Could not find address so that's kind of cool.

539
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,520
We saw one of the examples where we couldn't get an address for something.

540
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,650
So anyways there we have it.

541
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,770
We made it.

542
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,440
We successfully have this really cool hikers watch.

543
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,490
Sort of gives us nice detailed information.

544
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,250
Now there are some improvements that you can make with this right.

545
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:24,590
I think a big one is you could trim down these numbers sort of round them down so it's not some big

546
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:30,500
massive number and the other thing is probably if you're hiking you don't need to know your latitude

547
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:39,650
longitude and oh my goodness I just caught an the accuracy and the altitude at those right now are listed

548
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:44,930
as latitude but these things probably don't need to be updated every second and every time you move.

549
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:49,990
So if you change how often these are updated you could probably really save the user some battery worth

550
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,200
or hiking for a long time that could be very very important to them.

551
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,700
So let's go ahead make that last change.

552
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:59,150
I just want to make sure that this is exactly what we wanted.

553
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:06,030
So we do want this one to say accuracy and that one when we have the updated information.

554
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,510
I don't know why.

555
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:14,080
Because in our code to change this I thought that's really strange.

556
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,730
OK.

557
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,850
Longitude right there.

558
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,170
We're going to change this one to accuracy and

559
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:31,180
and the last one that we're going to change here is we're going to what is the altitude.

560
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,140
OK.

561
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,930
So I thought that is really strange how that's doing that well because programmatically set that wrong.

562
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,460
So this should look a lot better that's some of the if when you copy and paste you've got to be make

563
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,610
sure you're sort of on your game that you're fixing the different pieces that you need.

564
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,760
So there you go.

565
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,600
That looks much better if I change this to.

566
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,870
Let's make this something like 20 125.

567
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,870
That put us off the ocean and see if we're still in there.

568
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,400
See the opposite direction if I go here.

569
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,030
Douglas City California.

570
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,720
OK.

571
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,460
Interesting how that all works.

572
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:12,140
And you'll probably see now how it was very important that we were checking for Noal in different situations

573
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,810
right.

574
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,450
Because some of these don't have a thoroughfare the street address and so it's simply just saying the

575
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:22,880
city and the state so that you know in those situations it didn't crash or anything right.

576
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,400
It was still able to go.

577
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,280
OK.

578
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,890
So still more to learn in the section we're going to be making a very big app.

579
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,530
Let's talk about it in the next lecture.
