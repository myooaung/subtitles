1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,950
So there's a little bit of an issue with Android where apps and that's that.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,420
If you ever wanted to get some text some input from the user it be extremely hard to have that user

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,320
try and type it out on the wrist.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,150
However with awesome advancements with voice recognition we can actually use the user's voice and figure

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,250
out what they're trying to say and get that turned into a string.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,040
And so what we're going to do is we're going to start a new project to show you how you can access that.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,560
Now it's a little bit unfortunate because with the current set up you have to have an actual Android

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,090
Wear device in order to test that.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,440
So unfortunately we won't be able to do that right now but I'm going to show you all the code that you

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,660
would need and you'll see in the emulator at least getting fairly far with this one example.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:49,560
So let's go ahead and create a new project I'm just going to call this one voice demo and once we have

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,600
that we'll go ahead and hit next.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,040
Make sure that we are doing a ware project not a phone or a tablet thing.

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,260
And we'll go ahead and create our project.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,750
So with this we're not even going to mess with anything on lay out.

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,050
This is going to be an all coding activity here.

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,500
And so we're going to move over to our main activity and what we're going to do inside of here is you

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,090
may have been able to guess this but any time you want to sort of jump to something new we need to use

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,470
an intent and that's what we're going to use in this case so if you were to build an app you might have

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,450
some situation where when the user hits a button then you would initiate this intent but I just want

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,760
to show you what this content would look like now.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:38,270
So with this intent we're going to make a new intent which we can just call I and let me do the auto

23
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,330
complete on that.

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:48,660
So I will say intent is equal to a new intent and what we want to pass in there is you know what we're

25
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,340
trying to get to and that is something called a recognizer

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,570
cogging Nizer intent.

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,450
There we go.

28
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,990
And on this we are going to do in all caps action recognize speech.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,190
So that's our second option right there and this is saying hey we want to go get some speech from the

30
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,100
user.

31
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,240
Now with this there's a little bit of extra information that we have to add.

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:26,140
So if you do I put extra We are going to say recognizer intent dot extra language model.

33
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,110
And on this we are going to say there's a couple of different types of speech that you can grab.

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,930
We want the free form kind so again we're going to do this recognizer intent and on this we're going

35
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,010
to do language.

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,490
All caps here.

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,690
Language model.

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,930
And we want free form so you can see there's other ones like a web search and whatnot but we want free

39
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,390
form here.

40
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,550
OK so once you have that in place you just simply want to start an activity which will pass in the eye.

41
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,670
And we also want to be able to pass and then to say you know hey this is the one that we.

42
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,050
Excuse me it's not start activity.

43
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,630
That's if we're trying to move from activity to activity.

44
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,270
But we want start activity for results.

45
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,060
There we go.

46
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,820
That allows us to pass on the intent and in and like the numbers zero which is our request code so we

47
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,330
can know which one we're getting information back from.

48
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:28,290
So with all of this in place let's go ahead and you know if the user should instantly prompt them to

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,100
you know have a little screen where they can talk.

50
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,440
And then once we get back the text how do we handle that information.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:42,960
Well we make a new method called on activity result and inside of here we're going to do some code after

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,150
that super call and we're going to do an if statement first to make sure that we're getting back the

53
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,110
correct information.

54
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,910
So the first one is to make sure that we have the same request code.

55
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,050
So I'm going to say if request code is equal to zero and the next thing that we want to check is that

56
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,470
the result code.

57
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,180
So not the request code but the result code.

58
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:12,610
If this is equal to all caps result OK because that means you know we got back something successful.

59
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:19,410
Now if this is the case we can go ahead and get back a list of strings from the user about what it is

60
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,390
that they said.

61
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:29,940
So we're going to have a list here of string objects and let's go ahead and get the auto complete on

62
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,260
that.

63
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,170
There we go.

64
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:38,700
And I'm going to just call this results and we're going to say results you are equal to the data dot

65
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,020
get string array list extra.

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:53,700
And inside of here we're going to pass our recognizer intent and we're going to dot extra results do

67
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,640
extra.

68
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,140
Let's scroll down so we can find results.

69
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,300
There we go.

70
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,610
All right.

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,020
So that gives us this list of strings and then you know we want to be able to go out and use these and

72
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,050
so this is where I would go ahead and do a for loop where you would probably go through each of these

73
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,380
typically there's only going to have one come back.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,390
But you want to be up the list through.

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,650
It will give you multiple strings if it thinks it heard different things.

76
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:28,090
And so I would maybe do something where you say string result.

77
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,570
Notice this is singular not plural and I'll do my colon for results x and then you could go through

78
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,030
and you know use this particular string.

79
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:44,030
And so you could you know maybe in this case we'd want to go log it out so we could say log.

80
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,380
I will say something like.

81
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,580
Result.

82
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:56,620
And the go ahead and print out that result so we can go ahead and test this somewhat.

83
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,420
I mean you'll see the screen pop up but we can actually try saying something to the device so we'll

84
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,080
go ahead and give this a second to load up on the emulator here.

85
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,960
But if you do have an Android Wear device of course you can test this and see what it looks like.

86
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,850
And there we have it.

87
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,200
Here's our screen where it says tap to speak.

88
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,100
And I mean we can try hitting this button to say hello my name is Nick but you can see as soon as I

89
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,360
tap that we get errors and all sorts of problems there.

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,700
So anyways hopefully you enjoyed learning about this.

91
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,840
We still got more to learn.
