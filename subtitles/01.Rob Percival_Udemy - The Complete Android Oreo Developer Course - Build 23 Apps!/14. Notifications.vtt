00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.540
In this lecture we're going to learn about notifications and so notifications on Android Wear are excellent.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.500
Pretty easy to use.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.690
I'm going to walk you through all of it right here.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.860
So let's go ahead and do a new studio project.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.190
I'm going to call this where notification demo will go ahead and hit next.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.330
Let's go ahead and do a web app here are going to do API 26 and use the latest and greatest.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.270
There are some changes to notifications so I would stick with me on the same notifications here.

8
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.290
Let's do main activity and it hit finish.

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.870
OK so this is going to be another app where we don't have to visually work with any of the layouts but

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.300
we are going to have to do a lot of program and so we're not going to worry about that layout code but

11
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.440
also like you for us we'll be able to test this on the emulator.

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.120
So there's this code that works with the text view that's already there.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.680
I assume just go ahead and leave that it's not going to bother us now.

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.370
Essentially what we want to do is we want to make a notification and notify ourselves about it.

15
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.030
But there's a couple of things that kind of have to go in place first so the first big thing that we've

16
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480
got to get is a notification manager.

17
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.000
So I'm going to type out notification manager and I'll call it manager and this is going to be equal

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.630
to and we want to get system service and we're going to pass inside of here capital context.

19
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.960
The all the complete on that dot and we want notification service.

20
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.760
So make sure you get entered in there.

21
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.810
You're going to have to cast this to say that this is going to come back as a notification manager.

22
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.280
But once you do that all should be OK.

23
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.030
Then once you have this manager you need to create a notification channel.

24
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.180
So this is a new thing with Android.

25
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.930
Oh.

26
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.600
So let's go ahead and make that a notification channel or just call that notification channel is equal

27
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.720
to a new Capitol notification channel and inside of here there's a couple of things that we've got to

28
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.330
ads for the first one is the idea.

29
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.740
And we're going to have this by default.

30
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.070
The next is we're going to have to have a name and we're just going to call this a test because we're

31
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.060
just kind of making a little test case here.

32
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.320
And then for the Importance This is where we're going to want to say capital notification manager dot

33
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.280
and there's all these importances But let's just go ahead and do important default.

34
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.010
OK.

35
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.780
So they will go ahead and get it set up default test and importance default.

36
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.580
All right so that creates a channel for us.

37
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.140
The next thing that we need to do is actually although we've created this channel it's not quote unquote

38
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.860
been created in the manager.

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.760
So we're going to have to get access to this manager and say Dot create notification channel and we

40
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.500
just pass in our notification channel and that will work.

41
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.020
All right.

42
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.520
So with that in place the next thing that we need to do is build a notification.

43
00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.100
So we're just going to type out the capital notification dot builder to make a new notification builder

44
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.460
make sure you get the capital on that.

45
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.140
And I'll just go ahead and call that builder and say this is equal to a new capital notification Oh

46
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.070
really botched New their new notification builder.

47
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.240
And then inside of here this is new in Android.

48
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.770
Oh we want to pass this in the context but also we need to pass the channel ID which in this case is

49
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.230
going to be default.

50
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.940
So we'll go ahead and put default in there.

51
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.070
Now there some other things we want to add to this.

52
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.520
One is we want to set a title so we're going to do set content and we want title.

53
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.850
So maybe for our title we're going to say Hello there.

54
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.600
Excellent point.

55
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.760
Also we want to set some text Serbin and do set content text and inside of there we might say How are

56
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.920
you doing.

57
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.880
Question mark.

58
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.160
Other things that we want to add is an icon.

59
00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.780
So are you going to say Dot set small icon and there's lots of different icons that you can get access

60
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.260
to.

61
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.360
Let's do in lower case Android capital are draw a.

62
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.390
And there's all sorts of different options here but I'm going to do erro up float.

63
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.460
OK.

64
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.650
So once you have that in there there's one more thing I want to set and that's that we should have a

65
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.480
notification that when someone taps on it it will bring them back to the app and to do that we would

66
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.680
want to do a set content intent.

67
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.520
But in order to do that we have to have an intent to pass in there.

68
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.310
So we're going to make a new intent that we'll just call intent and let's say new intent and we want

69
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.890
this to have this further context.

70
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.290
But then also for where it's going it should come to this main activity because we only have one activity

71
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.390
for it to go to.

72
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.000
So just do me an activity class then we have to turn this into a pending intent.

73
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.740
So we're going to do pending intent.

74
00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:02.950
We'll just call it pending intent is equal to a capital pending intent and we want you dot get activity

75
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.420
and we're going to pass in this context next it needs a request code.

76
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.660
And again this is number that we can choose I'm going to use zero on this case than it needs of the

77
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.890
intent which we just created and then we're going to pass it no flags will do as you are there and our

78
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.910
semi-colon.

79
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.200
So now we have this pending intent which is a little different from this intent because it will allow

80
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.030
us to work with this notification and we're going to pass in that pending intent.

81
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.970
And with that in place we can finally place our semi-colon and say OK this notifications already to

82
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.970
rock n roll.

83
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.130
And now we have to just with one line of code get access to our manager and say Dot notify.

84
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.330
And now this wants to know two things the first one is the I.D. which we're going to pass through as

85
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.420
default.

86
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.260
Remember that's our notification channel and then it also wants to know what notification I'm trying

87
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.680
to pass.

88
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:05.500
So in this case I'm going to give it the builder that we just created and that will say Dot build and

89
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.450
that will create a notification for us so.

90
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.450
Oh and I forgot this is not default.

91
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.770
This is supposed to be zero.

92
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.430
This is supposed to match with the number we have given inside of our pending intent.

93
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.980
OK.

94
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.430
So with that in place let's go ahead and run this.

95
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.740
I'm going to run it on the round device and we'll see what this looks like.

96
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.520
All right so the app opened up right before I could finish the start the recording the little notification

97
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.420
for it disappeared.

98
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.580
So if that happened to you go ahead and hit this power button and if you swipe up from the bottom it's

99
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.960
going to show our notification.

100
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.400
Look at that.

101
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.130
Hello there.

102
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.880
How're you doing.

103
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.650
And if we click on this it's going to bring us back and look we can see that notification again because

104
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:53.410
it's running the same code and again you want to see it hit that power button swipe up and we can check

105
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.710
out our notification.

106
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.890
That brings us back.

107
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.670
OK.

108
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.260
One more topic that I would like to cover and then we will be done with this Android where many course.
