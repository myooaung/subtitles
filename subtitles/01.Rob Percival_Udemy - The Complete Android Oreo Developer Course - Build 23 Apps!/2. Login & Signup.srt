1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,000
For the final app we're going to create in this course.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,020
I've chosen the hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,540
As always we're going to be replicating the core functionality which is the direct messaging system

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,310
unlike Instagram and Twitter that we've cloned so far.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,870
What's app allows you to message individual users directly.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,890
And of course see a stream of your conversation with each individual user.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,230
So that's the plan.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,050
And as this is the final app we're going to build I'm not even going to show you the app in advance

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,510
so I would encourage you to just sit down and aim to replicate that functionality completely on your

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:36,750
own.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,870
So start with the A.W. what our server set up create your luggage use a list and then set up the chat

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,790
functionality.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,130
At this stage in the course it's something that you should be able to do really in a couple of hours.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,500
As always though if you want to follow along and watch how I do it you're very welcome.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,010
So give me a moment to pause the video now before I get started.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,810
All right.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:13,930
Well I'm of course going to begin at AWOS dot Amazon Dot Com to create my path server instance so I'll

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:26,590
lock myself in at the same time I'll jump over to Android dev of course dot com slash pass project dot

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,030
zip

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,800
to download the past projects.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,010
Ok I'm going to be using AZT

22
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,250
with the elastic Computing Cloud and I'm going to launch a new instance

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,810
from the AWOS marketplace

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,790
searching for pass

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,230
selects choose the you micro instance

26
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,330
and launch and then launch.

27
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,390
And as usual I'm going to create a new key path

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,400
which I'll call whatsapp keypad.

29
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,370
And then launch instance.

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,900
Okay.

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:38,840
And then we'll open up that instance page while the instance is setting itself up will jump over to

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,130
find way to find the pacifist art project which has now been downloaded and expanded for us.

33
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:54,640
So I'm just going to rename that to what's app and then open it up in Android studio in Android studio.

34
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,010
So file open.

35
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,810
And then is the desktop.

36
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,550
We can see what's app.

37
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,470
Excellent.

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,940
So now that's opening up with great efficiency we can now come back and see our AWOS instance click

39
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:25,060
connect use our Java S-sh client from within the browser and then for me the key path is slash uses

40
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,220
slash.

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,970
Rob Percival slash desktop slash whatsapp keypad.

42
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,080
PM

43
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,220
And I want to store that in the browser cache.

44
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,330
So I did have to type it in next time your key path of course will be the location wherever you've saved

45
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,380
that file that you downloaded.

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,160
And here we go.

47
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,830
So now we logged into the server.

48
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,080
So let's change directory to apps slash POS slash HP Dokes

49
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:16,430
and then open with vim VI the text editor the file server.

50
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:27,140
J.S. and that should then open up a file and allow us to access the app ID master key and server you

51
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,060
RL.

52
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,640
OK so let's check back either in Android studio.

53
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:48,740
I open up what's app project and open up our whatsapp project and we're going to start off in Stata

54
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,880
application to put in our app settings.

55
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,530
Jump back over to our S-sh session.

56
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,000
Start with the app ID.

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:11,710
So copy that paste it in then the masticate copy that paste that in.

58
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,750
Now interestingly I've got a different format for the server you are at this time.

59
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:24,320
Before I paste that in I'm just going to check it over in Firefox.

60
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,590
And see if it works.

61
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,450
It could be just a different way that the AWOS instance was set up.

62
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:47,280
But that doesn't seem to be collecting so I'm going to go back to my 82 instance and get the u r l from

63
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
here.

64
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:59,070
And try that out.

65
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,330
There we go.

66
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,170
So I'm not sure why it didn't give me that for you.

67
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:12,910
Well in the S-sh session I'm going to use the Amazon one that we're more used to that we go.

68
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,720
And from here it should be pos.

69
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,090
Let's now run the app and make sure everything is connected as we would like.

70
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,160
And there we go.

71
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,160
Can See that's been successful so we're looking good.

72
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:36,450
Let's just jump back over it see the past dashboard make sure that that's appearing correctly then and

73
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,990
there we go with our example object.

74
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,430
So everything's connected up right.

75
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,220
Okay.

76
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:53,800
Time to build out log in page let's get rid of example object code and also comment out enable automatic

77
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,930
user.

78
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,510
And now it should be pretty familiar.

79
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:07,150
I'm going to get back to the original logon and sign up system using the same form but a different mode

80
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,890
for log in and sign up.

81
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,360
So let's start with our text fields

82
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,420
just track that in in the usual way.

83
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:32,090
So this will be our user name and it text and the hint will be

84
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,730
your user name

85
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,430
and we don't want any different text them

86
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:45,820
and then

87
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,880
we'll have a password underneath

88
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:04,880
which will be a password edit text with a hint of your

89
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,430
password and then a button

90
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,200
which will initially be signed up which will send to

91
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,980
changed the text that you sign up and the lake will be.

92
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,400
Sign up looking

93
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,930
and then finally will add a text free

94
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
which up it underneath the button.

95
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:56,520
So you get a little bit and the text that will initially be all logging

96
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,960
and the so-called toggle logging mode

97
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,340
textfield when I should add the text sign up to the Boston

98
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,630
we get.

99
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,650
So let's get sign up working.

100
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:31,770
First of all we'll go over to the main activity doc Java and then write our public

101
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:49,350
Foyt sign up logging method.

102
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,890
So first we'll get the username and password fields to edit text

103
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,520
will have our user name edit text.

104
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,520
She's going to be an edit text.

105
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,460
We're going to find it by its ID

106
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,470
order Heidi.

107
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,420
Don't use a name at it.

108
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,840
Text same password

109
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,560
password edit text

110
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,280
and view by ID or an ID dot password.

111
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,040
Added text then we get to create our past user

112
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,290
which will be a new pass

113
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:54,550
use up and then we're going to and then we're going to add the user name.

114
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:06,190
So that's going to be username added text doc get text and we're going to convert that to a string.

115
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:16,750
Similarly with the password we use password edit text doc get text dot to stream

116
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:27,900
and then we'll take our user and we'll sign them up in the background with a new sign up Colback

117
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,210
which checks for an error

118
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,920
and if there's no error

119
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,880
find out we'll just load that user signed up

120
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,840
and if that is we'll display that to the user.

121
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,590
And we do that with we don't get message OK.

122
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,250
So let's give that a try.

123
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:16,560
We should now be able to put in a username and password and sign up a user when the button is tapped.

124
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,720
And here we go.

125
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,110
We're looking it except of course

126
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,090
I've forgotten to make those fill with

127
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:41,660
the lists just change those to match parent.

128
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,270
And now let's do first a test without a username password.

129
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,240
Excellent.

130
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,550
So we've got that error.

131
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,700
We need to get rid of that first bit again but that's no problem.

132
00:12:52,910 --> 00:13:00,570
And then let's create a rope with one two three four sign up.

133
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,700
So with any luck that one was successful I have a quick look at the Lokes.

134
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,350
Yep.

135
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,480
A signed up.

136
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,170
And then if we are tempted again

137
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,210
we should get an error message account already exists for this username.

138
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:17,980
Super

139
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:29,930
electricity a quick fix to get rid of that first part of the error message.

140
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,020
As you remember we do this with substring.

141
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:42,190
And then we want to start the first space so that we don't get message to an index of.

142
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,890
And then space and there we go.

143
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,740
So now let's allow the in mode.

144
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,130
So what creates a boolean

145
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,910
called

146
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,100
logging made active which will initially be votes

147
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:22,740
and then we'll check to see if logging made is active and if it is the user in and if not we'll sign

148
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,370
the user up

149
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,470
that will need the added text either way.

150
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,990
So just add them.

151
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:45,060
Now we just need to make it so that they all log in text is clickable and we're going to do this a different

152
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,480
way to how we did it before.

153
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:53,730
So rather than using an on click listener we're going to view all the properties of the text field and

154
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,230
we're going to look for clickable

155
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
which is downhere

156
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,550
and we're going to select that to make it true.

157
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,060
And then we're going to set an on click method just like we do for about an

158
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,670
down of a quick

159
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,250
several toggle logon mode.

160
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,460
All right so now we'll create

161
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,950
our toggle log in

162
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,620
mode method.

163
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,010
Using public voyde called by the text field.

164
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,010
And just to make sure our new method works.

165
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,700
That's just a quick log.

166
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,670
I call it mode called.

167
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:13,300
So just a quick check to make sure that when we tap on that button something happens and here we go.

168
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,010
So now let's tap all log in and you can see we get mode toggled.

169
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:28,070
So that other method for making text views clickable works fine.

170
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,660
So let's get rid of the log and check.

171
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,890
First off to see if logging mode is active

172
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,000
and we'll consider ourselves in sign up mode.

173
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,980
First off.

174
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,580
So if we're in sign up mode then logging mode active will be false.

175
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:56,680
So we need to change log in mode active to true so now we're going to be in loggin mode.

176
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,910
We want to change the bottom text to logon.

177
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,990
I'm not certain I gave the button an ID.

178
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,820
Let's have a look at patentee

179
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,030
let's give it a better idea.

180
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,660
And that's

181
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,540
Logan.

182
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:29,930
Sign up button.

183
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,680
So we're going to need our button either way.

184
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,610
So let's create a new button.

185
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,230
Log in sign up button.

186
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:52,280
Which is going to be a button using find view by id and then just remind myself what I call that button.

187
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,870
The idea doesn't seem to have saved let's get back to your properties

188
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,130
and logon sign up button.

189
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:16,620
And then here we can now bring that in that will also need the text view

190
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,080
which I called

191
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:33,780
Tabo lot in log in my text be very sensible to go log in my text FYI.

192
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:46,150
And this is going to be a text view V by ID or ID dot toggle logging mode text.

193
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,420
OK.

194
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:55,110
So if we're switching to logging mode then we need to change the button text

195
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,530
to logon

196
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:10,420
and we need to set the toggle logging mode text.

197
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:21,220
Tea or comma sign up.

198
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:29,580
And if we're going the other way we then need to change log in mode active to false because we're moving

199
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:41,820
to sign up mode which means we want to change the log in sign up button text to sign up and we want

200
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:54,870
to change the logon mode text view to say or log in.

201
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,990
All right so that should now work fine.

202
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:11,030
We just need to add the code to actually lock the user in so we can do this sort of with past user.

203
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,860
So we're going to log in in background

204
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:23,040
and then we need to pass a username and password and a callback so the user name is going to be username

205
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:37,120
added text or get text to string and the password is going to be password added text dot get text dot

206
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:48,350
to a string and then the callback is going to be a new logon callback.

207
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,940
And again as before.

208
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,050
We'll just check to see if he is no.

209
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,960
And if it is we'll log

210
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,450
have a user is logged in

211
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,420
and if it's not shared the user error message

212
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,350
and I'll just copy the toast command from down there.

213
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,630
All right so let's give it a try.

214
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:30,590
We should have now a completely working log in and sign up form and here we go.

215
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:36,990
So tap or log in and we can see that that's changing nicely.

216
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,140
So let's be in logging mode

217
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,530
and attempt to log in as me

218
00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:03,170
and with any luck we should see on the logs that were successful we use a logged in.

219
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:12,390
And of course if we try to log in with the wrong password we should get a nice error message.

220
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,530
Aha.

221
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:21,460
Now something interesting that we just got username password and that was because in this case we didn't

222
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:29,140
get the Java Lang parts at the beginning of the message so we should add a quick check to see if that

223
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,650
Java part is included.

224
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,510
And only then get the substring.

225
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,800
So let's write a quick bit of code to do that

226
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,410
will create a string called message

227
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,160
which will initially be equal to a dot

228
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:57,880
get message

229
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,990
and then we'll check to see if

230
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:16,210
message will convert our message to lowercase.

231
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,380
So we don't have to worry about whether the J in the Java is capitalized and we'll check to see if this

232
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,280
contains

233
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,230
what Java

234
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:49,810
and if it does then we'll update message with the substring Vashon

235
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,720
and we'll do the same thing.

236
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,920
Down here.

237
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,410
Great.

238
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,860
So let's just quickly test that in action and then we can move on.

239
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,000
To our use a list here we go.

240
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:25,930
Let's try signing up with a user name that already exists and you can see if we get that proper error

241
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,470
message.

242
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:33,320
And similarly with the logon again we get invalidly username and password this time.

243
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,130
Great.

244
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,340
So just one tiny thing we've got Paul start a project up there which I want.

245
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,910
So let's set the title

246
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,550
to whatsapp logging.

247
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,800
OK.

248
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,050
And that takes us to the end of this first video in the second video.

249
00:24:53,050 --> 00:25:00,420
We'll see how to add the user list and get ready to send and view messages.
