1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,560
So we're at a point or app where we can successfully log and we put in a password.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,460
If we do the sign up or Lagann we can get a message that tells us hey we have successfully logged in.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,320
So the next step for us is to show a list of all the users that the person is either following or not

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,930
following and have appropriate check marks next to their name which means we need a new activity.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,420
So let's go ahead and go file new.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,650
We want to bring in a new activity so let's grab one from the gallery here.

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,360
Empty seems great and let's go ahead and call this user's activity.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,750
So we'll go ahead and create that and with this it's just going to be a big list view so let's go ahead

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,490
and get the lay out for this opened up.

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,220
Go ahead and give ourselves some space to work with.

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,570
And again we just want to fill it up with a list view and then we'll go through the process of getting

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,620
you know all the users inside of there.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,730
And it looks like it's taking a second to load up here so I'm going to go back to our users activity

14
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,650
java file and I can start getting things set up.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,930
So we're going to have to have an array of users so let's go ahead and make an array list.

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:20,130
So we're going to make a new array list and I'm going to have this be an array of string objects.

17
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,260
So go ahead and do that.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,440
I'm going to call this user's experience.

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:34,000
Going to be a bunch of user names I will say this is a new array list can so get that all set up.

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,420
We're also going to need an array adapter at some point here and a second and we'll want to be able

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,080
to update that at various points so let's make a new array adapter that we'll just call adapter.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,650
And for the moment being we'll just define that.

23
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,290
Then inside of the create method this is where we want to fill up that user's arrays so we'll take our

24
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,430
users and let's add a few people inside of there so let's maybe do we'll put Nick inside.

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,970
And let's also add Sarah inside of there.

26
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,690
So go ahead and add Sarah.

27
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,780
Excellent.

28
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,730
So we've got a couple of users there.

29
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,690
Then it's time to create the list view which hopefully now our activities lay out is open and ready

30
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,410
to rock and roll.

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,890
So let's go ahead and go to arge containers.

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,280
We're going to bring in a list few and look at that.

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,500
It is filled up the space let's give it a proper ID.

34
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,980
I think I should just be the list view.

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,850
There we go.

36
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,110
And now we can come back to our users activity and we can get access to that list.

37
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:46,440
So I'm going to say List View with the name of list view is equal to a new or this is where we want

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,340
to find view by id our DOT ID list view of the Capitol there.

39
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,290
And again it's barking at me but I know that's going to come around here in a second because that was

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,200
the name we had just given there.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,270
The next thing that we want to do is we want to be able to say that this list view should be able to

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,520
let users add a checkmark next to it so this is kind of a new thing that we haven't done before but

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,400
we're going to say List view not set choice mode.

44
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,690
And we're going to set this equal to a B-S list view.

45
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,160
OK.

46
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,480
And then we're going to do it in all caps choice mode.

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,360
Multiple.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,150
OK.

49
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,030
So go ahead and get that set.

50
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,010
You're going to love what this looks like now.

51
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,170
So with that list fuel in place we are going to create an array or set up the adapter we had already

52
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,540
defined it before up at the top here and we had just called the adapter.

53
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,280
There we go.

54
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,320
So adapter is going to be equal to a new array adapter.

55
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,460
And inside of here we're going to pass this for the context that we're going to do our classic Android

56
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,910
dog our dog lay out.

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,400
And this is where we're going to get a little bit different.

58
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,030
Instead of choosing simple list item one we're going to choose a simple list item checked.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,480
So let's go ahead and move down until we find that simple list item checked.

60
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,390
There we go.

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,260
So we're going to add that in.

62
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,140
And then lastly of course we have to add our users.

63
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,260
So go ahead and type that there.

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,170
So that's our new array dafter and it's using this new layout for the items checked.

65
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,820
And we had said that you know this is going to be a choice mode list view here.

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,700
The next thing that we want to do is we want to be able to set an on click listener so that when someone

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,680
clicks one of these people they can actually check to say yes this person is you know I'm following

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,620
them not following them whatever.

69
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:48,030
So we're going to take our list view and we're going to set on item click listener and we want a new

70
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,550
adapter view on item click listener inside of there.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,020
OK.

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,260
So basically what we're going to try and do here is see whether this is checked or not and we want to

73
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,670
be able to let the user know about that or at least get a log in.

74
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,510
We want our selves to know about that.

75
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,420
So what we're going to do is we're going to take this view that comes through and turn it into a checked

76
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,550
text view because that's what's coming through in this new light out here.

77
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,530
So we're going to say checked text view and let's just give this a namecheck text view in case.

78
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,010
We're going to say that this is equal to our view that's coming through here but we're going to go ahead

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,170
and cast it as a checked text view just like that.

80
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,350
With that in place then we're going to do an if statement where we can actually use this checked text

81
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,240
view to see if it's checked or not.

82
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,930
So we're going to say OK check text view dot and we all just want to do is checked.

83
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,920
And if it is checked then we should go ahead and log out that information.

84
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,780
So we'll go ahead and say log that.

85
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:03,660
And we'll say info and then the second part that we'll pass through is all say checked exclamation point.

86
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,250
All right.

87
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,850
And then the else of the situation is that things are not checked and so would want to copy this log.

88
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,960
Paste it down below.

89
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,180
But instead of saying checked we will say it not checked.

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,260
Let's do that in big bold letters so we know the difference between the two.

91
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,150
OK.

92
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,750
So with that there we're going to need a way to get to this activity because as of right now it's just

93
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,160
going to be on this log in screen we have no way to get there.

94
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:36,360
So let's move back to our main activity and we are going to create a new method here so public void

95
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:44,250
and we basically want a method that's going to redirect it to the user list so redirect really direct

96
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,640
users what I'm going to call this.

97
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,640
And we don't need to have to pass in a view or anything like this because it's not connected to a button.

98
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,420
But the basic idea here is we check and see if the users logged in and we can do that with an if statement

99
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,890
where we say all right.

100
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,660
Capital parse user dot get current user.

101
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:09,210
And we're going to see if this is not equal to null so if it's not equal to know that we know we have

102
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,440
a user which then means we can successfully log them in.

103
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,930
So we're going to make an intent that we'll just call intent and say that this is equal to a new intent

104
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:35,570
and we want to the yet application context and then we want to move over to our user activity thot class.

105
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,650
OK.

106
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,880
So with that in place then we just want to simply start that activity and we'll pass in that intent.

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,270
All right.

108
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,040
Now with this redirect user we want to call this in a couple of places so I'm going to copy this.

109
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,040
The first one is when we log in if we're able are that when the user tries to log in if they're successfully

110
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,360
able to log in we should redirect the user.

111
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,090
OK that's one situation.

112
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,030
The next one is if they're able to sign up successfully we should redirect that user.

113
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,050
And then the last one is if they just open the app for the first time they've already logged on before.

114
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,970
Well then we should go ahead and redirect that user.

115
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,820
Those are sort of the three use cases there.

116
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,640
All right.

117
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,750
And there's one last little point of touch that I want to add here and that's that inside of our user

118
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,010
list view we should set a title there just to make everything nice and pretty looking.

119
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,650
And we're going to call this the user list King.

120
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,340
So with all of this in place let's go ahead and test out our project here.

121
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:47,040
Hit Ron and hopefully this will finally get rid of this error for list view Android studio being all

122
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,130
weird about that.

123
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:54,060
Again will go ahead and give that a second.

124
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,770
Well the app finally opened up here but it dawned on me something was wrong.

125
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,720
There's no list items inside of this list view and it's because I never set the adapter to the list.

126
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:11,690
So we've got to say list view set adapter and we'll go ahead and pass in the adapter.

127
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,000
So with that in place we'll go ahead and run the Senate finally did recognize my list view which I was

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,950
happy to see because I know I was right that just Android studio didn't have my back which was the first

129
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,160
time in a while.

130
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,960
This has been pretty consistent here for us which is great.

131
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,400
But there's me rambling against a computer program arguing with it but here it comes.

132
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,320
Opening up.

133
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,360
And look at that.

134
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,560
We see our users Nick and Sarah.

135
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:42,800
And even more importantly we've got these cute little check boxes so if I check on Nick look it turns

136
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,100
green.

137
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,250
And let's check out Lague cat here.

138
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,800
It should tell us checked and I'm going to open this up again.

139
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,930
Let's say I checked Sarah look that says check.

140
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,060
Now if I go check that it says not checked I checked Nick says not checked so I can go back and forth

141
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,640
back and forth just all the time with these to see what that looks like.

142
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,450
OK.

143
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:07,640
So this is a great starting point for us but the next thing that we need to be able to work with here

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,060
is we want to be able to see a list of the actual users not just these two that I randomly created here.

145
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,270
So in order to do this we need to have a couple of users to work with because right now if we go over

146
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:27,500
to our parts dashboard inside of users we only have one user which is Nick and so let's go back to our

147
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,870
app and if we hit the back button here this will actually take us to the log in sign up screen and let's

148
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,130
just make some new users so I might do Cerra password one two three four.

149
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,900
That will create a sign up and then take us here.

150
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm also going to do it a new name like John will do a sign up slash log in and let's even do one more

151
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,650
here we'll do Fido.

152
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,900
Fido the dog is now going to have a Twitter account so we'll go ahead and sign up for Fido.

153
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,670
So if we do this and we reload the user's page here look we've got all these new users.

154
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,940
Pretty cool that we have an app that can quickly make users like that.

155
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,630
And now let's go about the business of trying to get all these user objects.

156
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,610
So let's go back to our app here and in Android studio.

157
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,430
We're going to go ahead and get rid of these two lines where we're adding names arbitrarily to that

158
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,960
users list and we'll go ahead and clear that out and after we've set the on item click listener down

159
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,640
here is where we want to make a new query and this is going to be for Parsee users so we're going to

160
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:40,160
say parse queery and we want this to be a query of parce users.

161
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:48,790
So say parse user we go and let's just go ahead and call this a query.

162
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:55,840
Say this is equal to capital parse user dot net query.

163
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,010
OK.

164
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,970
With that in place then we want to say that this query should be for all the users.

165
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,080
Well except for us.

166
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:11,290
So we'll add that one detail there will say queery dot where not equal to.

167
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,560
And this is where we want to say anywhere that the user name is not equal to.

168
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,560
And then we're going to pass in the current user's username.

169
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,760
So do parse user get current user dot get username.

170
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,800
So that's an important distinction there to make sure we don't get ourselves back then with that in

171
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,230
place.

172
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,400
We're going to go ahead and do a query where we say that find in the background because we want to go

173
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,710
get all these new users in the background.

174
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,560
So we'll have to do a new fine background for all these parts users.

175
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,370
Now once we get this back we get this cool list of parts user objects.

176
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,300
So let's first check and make sure that there's no exceptions.

177
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,240
So say let's make sure it is equal to no.

178
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:03,520
And if that is the case forgot one equal sign there.

179
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,260
So if that is the case you want to make sure there's enough objects so we can actually just add onto

180
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:17,360
this honoraria say if is equal to nil and objects that size is greater than zero.

181
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,680
So that makes sure there is something in that list there.

182
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,250
If that's the case we can do this.

183
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,730
Awesome for loop where we can go ahead and move through each of the items in that list which are going

184
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,500
to be users so we're going to say parse user call them user.

185
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,870
This is going to loop through all the objects.

186
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:42,020
And then here this is where we would want to add their user names into the user list that we have up

187
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,920
top.

188
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,280
So we're going to go and say users which is that array list up there add.

189
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,810
And then we're going to add whoever the current user is not get username so it's going to get that current

190
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,980
user's user name and add it to that list up top.

191
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,920
Now once we've gone ahead and loop through all the different users we do want to take our array adapter

192
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,440
and we want to update that.

193
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:14,350
And it's not giving me access to the array adapter because I called it adapter.

194
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:14,810
All right.

195
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,200
So adapter dot and we want to notify data set change just say hey you know we've downloaded all these

196
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,780
new people you should know about it.

197
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:32,800
Let's go ahead and run this see what it gives us it'll be interesting to see whoever was last logged

198
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,450
in that person should still be logged in so they should see everyone but themself.

199
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,150
And I believe that was Feydeau We'll see if that's the case here.

200
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,680
So we come in and look there's Nick Sarah and John and no Feydeau.

201
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,150
And just to really test this.

202
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:53,020
Let's go ahead and try and sign in with Nick password 1 2 3 4 and Nick's not on the list but phyto is

203
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,230
this means that we now have access to everybody.

204
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,580
But the issue with this is you know let's say we are going to follow some people or not follow some

205
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,250
people.

206
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,850
Well we want to be able to tell parce about this and have it saved in the background so let's get back

207
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:16,300
to our parts dashboard here and under our user object we're going to be adding a new column.

208
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,580
So we don't want to add a new row here but we want to add new columns.

209
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:26,080
If you go all the way to the right you can click this add new column and what we're looking to add is

210
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,620
an array.

211
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,620
So if we scroll down here we have an option to add an array.

212
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,730
And this is going to tell us all the people that this particular user is following.

213
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,350
So if we keep an array of this if we wanted then see who that user is following and get those users

214
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:38,750
tweets.

215
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,990
We can handle that.

216
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,730
So we're going to go ahead and call this lower case is and then Capitol following make sure you have

217
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,720
no spaces there we want an array called is following.

218
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,620
All right.

219
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,880
So this should be added to all of our users here.

220
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,490
Then we want to go ahead and write the code in order to get this working.

221
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,780
So when someone checks a box or uncheck that box we should be making a note of that in parse server.

222
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,270
So let's get back to android studio.

223
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,040
So if somebody is going to check the box they want to add someone to their follower list.

224
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,870
So in order to do this we're going to say hey if they check the box this is a situation where they want

225
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,470
to add.

226
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,750
We're going to go get a Parsee user get current user dot add and we want to add for.

227
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,130
The key is following.

228
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,430
Right.

229
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,420
That's that new call that we made and what we're going to pass in that is the key.

230
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:38,640
And we're going to say whatever user it is which has users get at index because remember we're in the

231
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,950
side of this on click listeners so when they click on you know the item position of index to then you

232
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,920
know we can go grab that from the array we can pass that through and that's going to add them to that

233
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,140
array.

234
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,280
Now when we want to remove them from the array you would think would be just the opposite that we do

235
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,010
not remove.

236
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:03,240
But I don't know if it's a bug in parce code but it's become much more complicated than it was before.

237
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,240
So here's everything that we've got to do to make this work.

238
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:14,380
So the first thing is we've got to go get the list from the current user and we need to remove the user

239
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,820
that they are checking here.

240
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,030
Right.

241
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,780
This is in the unchecked situation they want to unfollowed.

242
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:26,590
So we're going to go get Parsee user get current user and we're going to get the list and we're going

243
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:30,130
to check out for is following.

244
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,950
All right.

245
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:38,720
And once we've done that we want to say hey let's go ahead and remove the users to get that position.

246
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:45,150
So it's kind of the same situation as last time but we're trying to now remove them from that list or

247
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,820
that array.

248
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,130
And so once we've done that what we're going to do is download that list here and so download I mean

249
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,080
we're going to move it into a new object and we're going to call this temp users and we're going to

250
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,170
say this is equal to capital parce users get current user dog get list.

251
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,750
And again we're going to pass and that key is following.

252
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,450
OK.

253
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,340
So this is going to take the list for the user that now has that one user removed put in this list called

254
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,380
tempt users then we need to wipe out the list completely from the current partial user.

255
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,130
This is where I was saying before this is kind of freaky that this is what we have to do now.

256
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,620
But we're going to get the current user and we're going to say remove it we want to remove with the

257
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,570
key is following.

258
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,910
OK.

259
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:36,910
Then once we have that in place the next thing that we want to do from here is we want to then put it

260
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,720
back into that particular space.

261
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:46,440
So we're going to open up the parse user one more time and we're going to say get current user.

262
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,220
And now we want to put that back in the same spot.

263
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,960
So the key is going to still be the same is following.

264
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,430
But now what we want to do is we want to add in that list that we created the temp users.

265
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,030
So we're going to go ahead and pass in Tempe users just like that.

266
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,390
So then regardless of whether we were adding a user or removing a user then we want to be able to save

267
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:17,830
this in the background so then we're going to say parse user Daut save in background or we've got to

268
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,780
go get the current user parse stock get current user dot save in background.

269
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,360
OK so go ahead and make that save.

270
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,270
Now with this it's important to note before we do anything we want to go to our parce dashboard here

271
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,930
we want to make sure for all of these is following that we have at least an initial array set up because

272
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:41,060
if it's no we're going to get all sort of errors so we've got to make sure we fill that up with an empty

273
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:41,870
array.

274
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:54,490
So with that in place let's go ahead and we will run this app gang and we will wait to see what do we

275
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,550
get in new user here.

276
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,580
Are we're going to log in as a user and then we're going to see if we can't make some changes here.

277
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:13,310
So wait for app to pop up for just a second here.

278
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,790
All right.

279
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:20,400
So here it comes in let's say I want to follow Fido so I'm going to hit that check when I go back refreshed

280
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,410
this page.

281
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,660
And for Nick here look at that.

282
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,090
Now he's following Fido.

283
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,310
It's in that list.

284
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,760
Let's say he also wants to add Sarah so he gets that.

285
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,060
Let's reload the page here.

286
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,340
And as we scroll over.

287
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,380
Oh my goodness.

288
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
Wouldn't you believe it.

289
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,810
There is Sarah.

290
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,020
So this is how we know that things are working.

291
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,540
So let's go ahead now and try and remove one of these users like let's say for example I don't want

292
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,530
to fall Fido anymore it's going to hit that checkbox.

293
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,940
And now if I reload this page.

294
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,600
Look that.

295
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,550
I'm only following Sarah.

296
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:58,790
So this is excellent This is telling us that hey we can now go in and determine who it is we want to

297
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,830
follow and not follow We're keeping track of that.

298
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:06,100
But the problem is if I were to reload this app it wouldn't detect that I'm following Sarah.

299
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,900
It would leave everything unchecked so we have to have a way to be able to account for that.

300
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:16,970
So we're going to go back to android studio here and we're going to scroll down to after we go and get

301
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,900
all the users and you know we add them into the users list and notify that the data set has changed.

302
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,190
Then this is where we want to loop through all the users and see hey is a current user following any

303
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,760
of these people.

304
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,610
If so let's go ahead and put a check by their name.

305
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,520
So we're going to set up this for loop.

306
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,300
Let's go ahead and get that there.

307
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,260
And the thing that we are looping through is the user's array.

308
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:47,180
So each time we go through there we're going to get a string which I'm going to call username and with

309
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:53,420
that once we have looped through we want to check and see if the person is following this individual.

310
00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:00,230
So in order to see that we're going to go get the current user and then we're going to get the list

311
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,940
from them of who they are following.

312
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,660
That's the.

313
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,580
Is following key there.

314
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,460
And then once we have that in place we're going to do a dot contains and this is where we're going to

315
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:16,460
check and say hey do you follow someone with this particular username and this will either give us a

316
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,630
true or a false to say yes I follow this person or no I do not.

317
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,910
So with this information if they do follow a person we're going to say OK.

318
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,030
Time to update the list.

319
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,630
Few will say few.

320
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,800
Set item checked and unset item check there's two things that we got to pass in.

321
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,160
So first is the index of where it is that we want to set the check.

322
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,100
So we're going to go tap into our users a rate list and we're going to say give us the index of the

323
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,080
following user name and we'll pass in user name just like that.

324
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,760
And then we are going to set that equal to true.

325
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,940
So you could see it equal that true or false about whether you want the check.

326
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,770
But in this case if they are following someone we want that to be true.

327
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,990
So let's go ahead and run this now shall we.

328
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,550
So we should see that Nick is following Sarah.

329
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,110
So when he logs in Sarah should have the check mark that will be our mark for success.

330
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,650
OK.

331
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,180
And we open up and boom.

332
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,730
Look at that.

333
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,890
Sarah is being followed.

334
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's really put it to the test.

335
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,800
We'll follow John and Fido and then unfollow Sarah.

336
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,200
OK will reload this page here to see if that's correct.

337
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,830
Now it's only John and Fido right.

338
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:31,510
John and Fido and will reload this one more time here from Android studio to see if this is the case

339
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,920
and opens up and look there is John and Fido.

340
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,960
So one more notch on this app we were able to successfully say that we want to follow her and follow

341
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,980
people and see that list.

342
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,560
We still got more to go but we're making great progress.
