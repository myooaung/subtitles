1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,300
In this lecture I want to help our little dude make it so that he can start falling down with gravity

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,970
and moving around on the screen.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,930
So this is where we're going to start introducing some physics into our game.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,370
I know that sounds a little bit complicated at least it was for me the first time I started doing game

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,570
programming but it's really not that bad.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,380
So the first thing that we want to set up is the gravity.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,120
And so this is how quickly our little dude is going to fall.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,280
So we're going to make a new float.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,210
We're going to call gravity and you decide what you want this to be equal to.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,200
I found something like zero point two is a good place.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,390
But again it's going to be different for everybody.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,830
There's also another float that we want to introduce here and this is the velocity.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,210
So go ahead and bring in velocity.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,680
You can set this equal to whatever you want.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,000
But I think a good starting point is at zero not the Letter 0 0.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,880
Now we go.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,070
So with these two pieces in place we can now write the code to make it so that our guy starts falling

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,160
down through the sky.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,100
And so first of all we're going to do is we are going to calculate our man's velocity.

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:21,140
So we're going to say velocity is equal to whatever velocity currently is plus gravity.

21
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:28,600
So kind of a simpler way to do this is we can just say hey plus equals gravity just like this.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,070
All right.

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:36,540
So we're going to go ahead and add that on there and then we're going to introduce a new variable here

24
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,750
and this is going to be the man's y position.

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,170
So we need a way to represent this guy's position when he's going to start the game and then as he starts

26
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,260
falling you know that's slowly going to update over time.

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,780
So we're going to come up to the top.

28
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,810
We're going to make an event that we're going to call man y again represents where he's going to be

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,320
on the screen.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,680
So with this man why initially when the game very first starts we want that to be equal to you know

31
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,660
half of the height divided by two.

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:17,550
So we're actually going to cut this and we'll go ahead and paste that right in there so we can just

33
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,210
do that off the get go and we'll go ahead and replace man.

34
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,260
Why.

35
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,840
They're excellent.

36
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,090
But then we're now going to have an opportunity to change what man y is going to be.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,720
So we've already calculated what the velocity is.

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,560
Now we have to apply this to man y and we're going to say Hey man why there's going to be equal to minus

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,500
equal whatever velocity is.

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,830
So you'll notice the first time we come through velocity is zero gravity 0.2.

41
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,490
We're going to subtract like 0.2 not much.

42
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,750
But then the next time velocity is going to be 0.4 of them point you know six eight whatever and slowly

43
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,500
we're going to see man y start falling down to the ground.

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,370
And so with this we should see him falling.

45
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,040
Let's let's give it the Old Testament confirm that's what we've got.

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,630
So we'll get our emulator here.

47
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,470
Ready to go and coin man has stopped.

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,310
I believe it's probably because I'm not allowed to set this up there.

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,500
So I want to go ahead and put zero there not before I copy that.

50
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:31,130
And we'll come and say all right you are on create maybe this is a good place for us to say you know

51
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,030
what.

52
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,340
Very first time we were on this.

53
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,670
Man why you should be equal to the center of the screen.

54
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,420
OK.

55
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,640
So let's try that one more time with Hopefully no airs there.

56
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:50,860
So here comes our app opens up and look at that or a little dude's falling but you fell off the screen

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,200
and you have even if we clicked there's no way to get them to come back up.

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,780
So there's one thing I want to do first to make sure that he you know if he lands down on the ground

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,570
he should be running on the ground unless we're making them jump.

60
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,540
And so we just need to check when we're doing all these calculations if you know man wise in the zero

61
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,130
or less than zero position we need to you know keep it at zero.

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:20,080
So we're going to do a little statement here when we say if we're going to say if man why is less than

63
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,510
or equal to zero meaning he's you know at the bottom of the screen or somehow deep below we want to

64
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:32,560
set his man y to be equal to zero so that he always kind of stays at the bottom.

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,390
So if we go ahead and run this now you'll see he'll fall down but he'll stop there at the bottom.

66
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,410
We still got to figure out the jump situation but at least this will get him to the bottom and looking

67
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,490
at all sudden he stops and he's now just running on the ground.

68
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,060
So the next step for us is to make it so that he can jump now in order to do that.

69
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,270
What we're going to do here is we are going to do a little if statement is you know decide if he should

70
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,050
be jumping or not.

71
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,610
So I'm going to go ahead and put this more at the top here and this is going to be an if statement that

72
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,040
will teach us how to work with touch.

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,850
So GDX has this awesome if we do GDX dot input dot just touched.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,550
This will be equal to true when someone just taps the screen in it you know recognizes that the next

75
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,430
time that loops run this will be true.

76
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,300
It will be equal to false after that.

77
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,470
So this is only true once.

78
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,550
And so this is our opportunity to you know have a negative number here.

79
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,320
So in this case we're going to say velocity is equal to negative 10.

80
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,420
So the idea with this is when we say velocity is equal to negative 10 as we come down here we're going

81
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:49,390
to say OK negative 10 plus equal gravity so now it's like you know negative nine point eight and then

82
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,380
we're going to do zero minus negative 9.8 which really adds 9.8.

83
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,060
So it makes him jump up and if he wasn't at zero would make him go even higher and higher.

84
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,470
So let's go ahead and run this.

85
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,150
I want you to see what this looks like for yourself.

86
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,870
And we'll will go ahead and wait a second here and look at that.

87
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,950
When I click here he jumps up how cool is that.

88
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,930
That is an excellent thing that we've got going here.

89
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,490
So we've got some beautiful beautiful movement.

90
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,630
All right.

91
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,370
So I know we didn't go too far in this one but I feel like Logically this is a good stopping point for

92
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,590
us in the next one.

93
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,360
We're going to tackle the big subject of how do make the coins in the bombs move across the screen so

94
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,580
we're going to get into all of that in the next lecture.
