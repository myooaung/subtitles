1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,040
All right.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,030
So now that you have a good grasp on Copland right we need at least know the basics that are going on

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,630
here.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,460
It's time to move over and talk about how do we take these skills that we learned in cotland and then

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,780
apply them to Android studio.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,060
So let's go ahead and open up Android studio now.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,410
We're you're first going to just create a new project in cotland we're going to talk about how we can

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,550
convert things with colleges just all sorts of bits and bobs here.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:37,760
So go ahead and get Android studio opened up and here we want to just create a new Android studio project.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,920
So this is going to be just kind of a test funded app for this let's just go ahead and call this cotland

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,280
fun maybe.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,160
And now the big thing is come down and make sure that you have include Cartland support check.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,890
That's the big thing that we're trying to do here.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,620
So I'm going to make sure I get this saved in the proper location.

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,530
There we go.

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,020
I want that slash Tolland.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,730
Fun.

18
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,370
Good with that then go ahead and select what you want here.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,940
I'm going to go with the latest and greatest API 26.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,950
And I want an empty activity and we'll just do the main activity there

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,560
soon known as this looks a whole lot like our old stomping grounds.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,950
Maybe just a little bit slightly different with the column but I'm going to walk you through all of

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,760
that here in just a second.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,150
So we'll wait for this to come through.

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,330
It Right you can do it.

26
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,860
Android studio we believe in you.

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,420
That's something I really like about a Tele.

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,960
It's a little bit more thinned out you know more specific on what it's folky not focused on.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,140
And it just goes a little bit quicker I think.

30
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,290
So here you can see a lot of things look pretty similar right.

31
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:18,010
Like when we have this on create function the same things are coming through but it's going to be just

32
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,480
a little bit different here whenever we're going to work with code.

33
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,580
So let's go ahead and go to our lay out file here and you know let's walk through the process of how

34
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,700
do we bring something from here into our code.

35
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:37,900
I think you'll find that to be kind of interesting so we'll give this a moment to load up there and

36
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,550
here we go.

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
We've got a text view.

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,330
So let's go ahead and make some changes to this text view song and give this the name of text for you

39
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,870
just like that.

40
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,080
That will come back to our main activity and we're going to say you know what we want to create a new

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,740
text for you and before you know we had always done something like say text view and then you know give

42
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,730
it the name text you.

43
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,370
But in this case you know we would want to create a variable so we would say something like var text

44
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,100
view and we're going to say this is going to be equal to.

45
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:17,370
And then we'll do our find view by id and we are looking for a text view.

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:25,010
So that's what we should anticipate coming back to us and we'll still do our classic our DOT I.D. dot

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,000
and this is where we would find our text view.

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,890
Excellent.

49
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,120
And boom all of a sudden we have a text field right.

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:40,100
Just like we had before and let's say you want to set something inside of this right text view.

51
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,720
Set text.

52
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,430
And we can do that and just put in a string like hello.

53
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,160
Fam we'll do something a little different than Hello World so we can just prove that this is working

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,610
and I'm so used to doing something Colon's look I'd put a semi-colon there when it didn't even need

55
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,170
to be.

56
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,160
So let's go ahead and just test this out.

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,720
I know this is a simple app but let's just confirm and see if this is working.

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,970
So go ahead and put this on one of our devices here.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,760
So we're finally finished building here.

60
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,520
And look at that.

61
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,500
It's a work of art.

62
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,690
Hello Pham.

63
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,830
Again very very simple app here.

64
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,990
But I want you to just to kind of get used to this whole feeling of looking at something in cotland.

65
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,900
And so to sort of get used to that I'm going to give you a little challenge here.

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,990
I want you to make a counter app so this is sort of similar to something that we're going to build later

67
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,070
when we're going to be talking about Android Wear.

68
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,300
But the basic idea is I want you to make an app where you can add a count button that's going to add

69
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,390
plus one to a counter and a reset button.

70
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,850
So maybe you're counting the number of people that come into the museum or you're counting the number

71
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,400
of birds fly by your window.

72
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,330
I don't know what it is but you won't have a text view in the middle of the screen.

73
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,350
A button that's going to add things and then a button that will reset the counter.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,940
So that's my challenge for you try and do that all in cotland.

75
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,130
Good luck.

76
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,720
OK so hopefully that went well for you.

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,120
Let's go ahead and work on the visual side of things first.

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,220
Again this shouldn't be too challenging for you.

79
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,450
At least you know Android wise we know how to do all this stuff is just making sure we can get it done

80
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,360
in cotland.

81
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,390
So we're going to put a button a little bit below the text few here.

82
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,140
Going to go ahead and connect it to that and I'm going to change its name to say plus one.

83
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,820
So that's where we're going to use to count up.

84
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,490
Also bring a button above our Hello world here.

85
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,840
Connect it down to that text for you and I'll make it 31 just like the other one so that we have some

86
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,770
consistency.

87
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,560
And this is going to be a reset button.

88
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,610
OK.

89
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:05,990
So the on click for the reset button here is going to be reset and the click for the plus one is going

90
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,310
to be plus one.

91
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,110
Yeah I know.

92
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,410
Who would have guessed these crazy function names.

93
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:17,050
But with that in place we're going to go ahead and create our new function.

94
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,210
So we're going to say function and we're going to call this reset.

95
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,800
We'll go ahead and do our parentheses and we need to take in something called a view with a capital

96
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,890
view here.

97
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,380
Go ahead hit enter on that for the import and then we'll go ahead and do our curly brackets.

98
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,510
So with this now in place that's the reset.

99
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:46,580
We also need to make a function for when we get the plus one we'll do plus one then we're going to take

100
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:54,080
in the view there go do our curly brackets and I like them with spacing you can do without kind of up

101
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,110
to you.

102
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,630
The real goal of this app is to be able to count something we've got to keep track of that count somewhere.

103
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,080
So I'm going to create a new variable as a property up at the top which I'm going to call count and

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,200
we're initially just going to set that equal to zero.

105
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,880
Then when someone wants to reset we'll take this count and again set that equal to zero.

106
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,180
But then we want to update the text view.

107
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,510
So we'll take a text view and say set text and inside of here we're going to take our count and this

108
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,250
is so cool with Cartland.

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,060
Look at this we do count two string.

110
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,110
It's that easy.

111
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,600
All of a sudden now we can display the count inside of the text view.

112
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,820
And what happens inside of the plus one.

113
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,010
Well let's say we want to do count plus plus then we want to update the text for you again.

114
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,320
We can just copy paste that right inside.

115
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,630
So let's go ahead and give this a roll.

116
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,580
I guess one thing that we should change here is we should have the starting text for hello world to

117
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,480
be zero.

118
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,940
Go ahead and fix that real quick.

119
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:08,560
And with that in place let's go ahead run this if it gives us a chance to we might just have to look

120
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,160
like how it is as soon as we hit reset.

121
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,680
It's going to go back to zero.

122
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,400
So just know the changes that we made will work and I'm going to show you a thing in a second here and

123
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,820
we forgot to center a button so that looks really tacky but we hit reset.

124
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,200
Look that goes to zero.

125
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,280
But now I can hit this button as many times I want and I can reset that goes back to zero.

126
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,250
So functional up pretty cool right.

127
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,070
Style wise few things that I do want to change this button.

128
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,220
I want to make sure that this is centered song and right click center horizontally again here and then

129
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:47,860
right click center horizontally and the next thing is I really want to beef up the size of this text

130
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,310
view.

131
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:56,340
And so we're going to go inside of the detailed attributes and let's scroll down to our friend here.

132
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:02,920
And for text size Let's go ahead and beef this up to something like 40 maybe even 60.

133
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,760
Let's go a little bit crazy here.

134
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,640
So that looks good to me.

135
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,410
Now something that I want to show you here that will hopefully blow your mind and just make cotland

136
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:18,850
that much cooler is we've been setting the text what I consider to be quote unquote the old school way.

137
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:25,270
It's kind of the retro way whereas you know count here this is shown sort of showing the new way that

138
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:34,330
we can do things in cotland So instead of saying here set text to hello fam we can do text view dot

139
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:42,580
text and simply just access text attribute and say this is equal to hello fam or something like that.

140
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,080
Right.

141
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,980
Like this is all it takes.

142
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:52,840
So again here when we're setting the text view to the count we can just say text few text is equal to

143
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,410
count two string.

144
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,630
It's that simple.

145
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,230
There's no need to keep putting things in parentheses like.

146
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,520
I don't know about you but I think this is so much more readable than this.

147
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,180
I mean even in cotland This makes it even more easy to check out in C but it's just one step further

148
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,040
and I just think wow this is you know so much cleaner so I'm going to go ahead and copy this pace that

149
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,970
there we actually don't want this to say hello fam when we start.

150
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,420
Let's have that beat zero and we'll go ahead and run this one more time just to prove that we can make

151
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,340
things work in this new way.

152
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,290
So we'll go ahead and run this

153
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:41,300
way for our app to pop up here and look at this so we can add up these numbers hit the reset button

154
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,910
goes back to zero.

155
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,950
We are in a great place hopefully starting to see not only was it fun learning about the principles

156
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,750
of cotland but we can do some awesome stuff with our Android programming and I still got more to show

157
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,120
you.
