1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:07,240
So were able to successfully now log into the app create a snap including uploading an image and a message

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,070
saying who we want to send it to and then then that person when they open up the app is going to see

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,260
all the messages that they have.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,150
So really the last step for us is we have to let the user be able to view the snaps that have been sent

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,890
to them and when they're done viewing to then go delete the image on the back and delete it from the

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,400
database.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,180
All that good information.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,090
So let's now write the code that we need to make it so that when someone taps on one of these then we

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,660
can go see what that particular snap looks like.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,940
So in order to do that we're gonna have to move on to a new activity so let's get back to android studio

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:48,490
and make our last activities are a new activity and we'll just go ahead and do our empty one just like

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:55,240
we've done before and I'm going to call this the view snap activity that kind of describes what's going

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,110
on.

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,010
So we'll get finished there.

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,790
Now with this view snap activity what is it that we're trying to display here.

16
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,670
What we'll try to display whatever the message is and then also the image the image is kind of the most

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,560
important thing here.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:18,730
But let's go ahead and put just with text a text you up at the top here that will display whatever it

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,670
is that the messages.

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:28,860
So we'll go ahead and add that one to make sure that we right click here and say this should be centered.

21
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,960
And we also want to it looks like we're going to have to wait for the grade all to finish up here to

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,380
do that.

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:44,030
So it's looks like it's done now going to Right-Click center that good to have it be connected up to

24
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,970
the top and looks like that's been connected now with a height of 16 that looks good.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,110
We wanted to go all the way to the edges in case it's really big.

26
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,320
And so I'm going to go ahead and put the 16 on the edges here and then we'll just go ahead and change

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,310
this so it actually fills all the way then that's going to make it so that we have to have our text

28
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,670
be centered because you can see it's kind of off to left.

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:19,460
I think it looks best if it's all sort of centered so for text alignment we'll go ahead and change this

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,530
too.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,890
Let's get that dropdown menu we want it to be Center.

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,470
There we go that looks looking good.

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,200
We got the text view there.

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,250
Now we need to add an image view.

35
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,980
So I'm going to bring out an image view by default.

36
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,190
We'll just have it you know fill some sort of color in just to keep things different.

37
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,620
We'll have this one maybe be a dark color.

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,330
Well let's keep it pink so that we can know that's kind of what we've used to tell the user that we're

39
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,690
waiting for an image to come through.

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,020
But with this you know we want to connect this up to the friend there who like that.

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,680
Let's go ahead and make this big enough that we can actually work with it.

42
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,170
And it's not going to let us do that.

43
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:12,500
OK so we want to connect this to the left to the right to the bottom save maybe say 16 for this 16 for

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,040
that and 16 for the bottom.

45
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:22,060
We also want to connect up to the top and that is not connecting to the text you like I like it.

46
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,990
So maybe you'll have to manually click drag.

47
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,140
There we go.

48
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,510
And we'll have that be 16 as well.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,700
I will go ahead and change these so they fill up the appropriate space.

50
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,180
Ooh.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,650
There we go.

52
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,180
Nice big image you.

53
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,350
It's great then with this text view.

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,360
I'm going to go ahead and call this the message text view.

55
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,240
All right.

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,260
And then we'll have to give a proper ID for the image of you.

57
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,280
Let's call this the snap image.

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,990
You all right now that we got that all in place we shouldn't need that design file anymore but we'll

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,190
have to go ahead and get some stuff connected here like that text view and the image view that we just

60
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,810
brought over.

61
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,340
So let's go ahead and start there.

62
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,660
We'll call this first.

63
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:28,250
The message text view and this will be a text view knowable which will initially be no notice and then

64
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:37,430
will also have the snap image view which should be a image you know a ball and that will also be able

65
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,800
to know initially.

66
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:47,240
OK so let's go ahead and set these up message text for you your equal to find view by id our DOT ID

67
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,830
message it.

68
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,590
Oh not a text message text view.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,550
There we go.

70
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:04,610
And then for a snap image view say you're equal to find view by ID card that Id snap the image view.

71
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,320
Excellent.

72
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:12,680
So we've got all of that in place but then we've got to make right the code so that we can move into

73
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,890
this view snap activity so let's go back to our Snap's activity and even I guess before then we need

74
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:23,870
to make it so that when someone selects an item from the list view that we go ahead and get them to

75
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,370
the correct place.

76
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:33,860
So we need to get our list view which is the Snap's list view and put a little question mark there and

77
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:43,940
we're going to set in an item click listener so that equal to adapter view dot on item click list or

78
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,860
the one with curly brackets.

79
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,620
So say yes for all those.

80
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,030
So now we can run some code when we get all this information.

81
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,430
And I guess the first thing that we want to do is we want to get the appropriate snap that someone has

82
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,480
selected right because there's going to be you know one from Joe one from Nick there could be a whole

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,110
lot more there.

84
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,470
Got to know which one it is that they picked.

85
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,770
So I hear tell us the proper index that was used but you know we have to use that appropriately.

86
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:21,710
And so right now we're not listing all the actual snapshots of these snaps and that's important because

87
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:28,130
the snapshots can stain contain information about you know what the image you are l is what the message

88
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,930
is.

89
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,030
And so we need to get all of that inside of a separate array list.

90
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,960
So we're going to make a new frailest here cold snaps.

91
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,300
And this is also going to be an array list but it's not going to be in a list of strings.

92
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:48,330
This is going to be an array list of the data snapshots of data snapshot.

93
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:55,200
I just set this equal to an empty array list and then here inside of this on child added We're going

94
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,440
to take our snaps array list and we are going to add on to it.

95
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,780
This data snapshot that we got so it's really just as simple as passing peer zero into there.

96
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,490
I mean we'll have to you know confirm that there's actually something in there so that are two exclamation

97
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,270
points but that's all we need to add that to there.

98
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,630
So now down below we can say.

99
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,530
All right.

100
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:26,250
On a new value that I'm going to be calling the snapshot in this is equal to Snap's dot get and then

101
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,930
we just simply pass and.

102
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,400
And now we have the snapshot that we can work with and pull out all the proper information.

103
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,390
So what things do we need we need to know the image name the image you are l the message the key that's

104
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,850
part of that snap and so there's all sorts of different things that we need here.

105
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,990
But first let's just make an intent that will get us to that new activity so we'll say intent is equal

106
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,640
to new capital intent and inside of here.

107
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,270
We're going to provide this.

108
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:02,110
And then where we're trying to move to is the viewer snap activity once you get the class for that.

109
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,370
Eventually we're going to want to start that intent.

110
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,230
So we'll go ahead and do our start activity but in between there's a lot of information that we want

111
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,590
to provide via extras.

112
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,610
So we're going to do our intent put extra.

113
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,080
So one of those things is going to be the image name.

114
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,450
All right and we're going to go ahead and copy and paste this for everything that we need so copy and

115
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,880
paste paste paste.

116
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:35,070
So once the image name one is going to be the image you are all one is going to be the message.

117
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,490
And then lastly we need to have the key for this snapshot so that we can go ahead and properly delete

118
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,120
it.

119
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,190
So we're also going to have to provide these when I'm going to call the snap key.

120
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,210
You'll see how this comes into play.

121
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:55,170
But first if we want to provide the image name well let's get into this snapshot that we have so snapshot

122
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:06,510
dot and let's get to the child child and we want to get to the one that's named image name and then

123
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,820
we want it's value which should come through as a string.

124
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,140
And that is properly set and we're essentially doing the same thing for the next two.

125
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,360
So I'm just going to copy and paste this below and then we'll have to change.

126
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,840
You know in this case we're trying to get the image you are ill and in this case we're trying to get

127
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,810
the message right.

128
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:34,260
So then the last piece for the snap key we just have to do snapshot snapshot dot and then it has this

129
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,950
key function here which will go get the key for that which this is going to be you know a little random

130
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,970
string of letters and numbers here.

131
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:50,040
So with all of that in place we then have all the proper information flowing over to this view snap

132
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,250
activity.

133
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,550
So with all of this now we can then go ahead and fill up everything that we need to.

134
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,380
So for example we can set that message text view we can download an image right.

135
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,590
All that good stuff.

136
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,500
And so first let's just go ahead and set the message text for you I think that's a good place to start.

137
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,190
So we're going to say message text viewed text is going to be equal to.

138
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,750
Let's go grab the intent dot get string extra.

139
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,980
And we should get whatever the messages and pass that through.

140
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,870
Let me do a question mark there because that's knowable but that's literally all it takes to show the

141
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,230
message.

142
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,830
Now to get the image.

143
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,290
Now that's a little bit more work because we have to go and download an image and I talked about this

144
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:44,910
earlier in the section but we've already done the code to properly go find and download an image and

145
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,540
so I'm just going to open that up from a previous project again.

146
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,820
I think that was Section 5 that we've done that.

147
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:57,090
So I'm going to go to my downloads here and this project called downloading images and I'm going to

148
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,800
open this up.

149
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,990
This should have all the code that we need in order to make this work.

150
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,730
So here it comes.

151
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,660
Yep and here inside of this mine activity remember the big thing was this image downloader that allows

152
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:20,790
us to go and grab an image so I'm going to copy this public class and just copyright like that we're

153
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,400
going to move this down below so we can sort of differentiate between the two.

154
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:32,750
And so I'm going to come back to my view snap activity and after outside of the function here I'm going

155
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,260
to paste in that class which is going to say hey do you want to convert this.

156
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,790
We'll say yes and yes please go get all those awesome imports.

157
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,300
All right so that'll go do all the proper importation that we need.

158
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,550
But then the next thing that we needed to do is we need to you know go fire off that function of you

159
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,440
know going and getting that image.

160
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,760
So when we go back to our other project here and this is where we want to then go copy all this code

161
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,070
where we create a new image downloader and you know we try catch all this stuff so I'm just going to

162
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,500
copy come back and paste this in.

163
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,140
And yes I'm going to ask it to do the import of this last time we work on this.

164
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,830
It was getting the image of Homer Simpson How great is that.

165
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,070
So rather than get your own We're not we're not looking for Homer Simpson here.

166
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,950
Instead we want to get whatever the image your L is and we have that via the intent so we're just going

167
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:36,820
to say intent get string extra not a Rackstraw get string extra.

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,680
And that will just be image you l.

169
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,310
And then once we've done that we're trying to set the image which in this case is not called image you

170
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,390
would snap image.

171
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,970
So we'll just change this to snap image view and remember to put a little question mark there to make

172
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,600
sure that everything works out.

173
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,870
And really that's all it should take in order to get this up and running.

174
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:07,680
So big moment for us here we should see now when we run this app that we have the ability to view these

175
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,770
snaps that people have sent us.

176
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,890
So let's go ahead and give this a moment and while this is loading I'm going to close out of these other

177
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,750
projects so it doesn't slow us down here.

178
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,340
Leave open this snap chat project.

179
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,200
But here we go.

180
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,970
Pops the app and I'm so excite Let's see what that one from Joe is that should be the one that says

181
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,630
like our first snapper or whatever sold click on that and boom look at that.

182
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,300
Our first snap and it shows the proper image there we can go back.

183
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,500
Let's look at Nick what did he send us from me.

184
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,010
Kind of the message but look at that.

185
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,040
We have a functional project now.

186
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,870
You could argue that we have left out maybe the most important part of this and that's that the whole

187
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,820
lure of Snapchat is that once you open something it's then deleted so that you know you can kind of

188
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,860
send stuff and not really care like oh maybe there's an ugly picture of me but you know it's going to

189
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,090
be deleted doesn't really matter.

190
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:11,150
So we've got to make it so that after a user views something and then hits the back button that that

191
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,090
image that snap is completely deleted.

192
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,540
Well how do we do that.

193
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,350
First we've got to run some code here inside of the snap activity when someone hits the back button.

194
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:27,150
So we're going to go ahead and type out one of those on back pressed again.

195
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:32,970
Keep in that super combat press but now inside of here this is where we want to run some code to go

196
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,470
delete information.

197
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,510
So there's kind of two things that we have to delete.

198
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:43,530
One is we have to delete the database reference so if we looked at this snap from Joe we want to delete

199
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,840
from this level right here.

200
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,540
That's one thing that we want to delete.

201
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,910
The next thing that we want to delete is in storage.

202
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,310
We have images right.

203
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,290
And we would want to delete the image file so that we don't know if we've promised the users that we

204
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,150
delete it we should delete it but even more than that if we don't delete these images they're just going

205
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,580
to get bigger and bigger and eventually you know it's going to we're going to pass on to a page here

206
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,990
of firebase And you know then we're going to start paying money for this thing and it's like now just

207
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,670
kind of sucks the fun out of your thing.

208
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,150
So remember you've got to delete the database and the storage.

209
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:25,350
So step one for us let's work on the database side of things so on this back pressed.

210
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:33,290
We're going to first work with the fire base database and we go get instance get reference you that

211
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:41,160
should just be clockwork at this point and we want to go to the child for users and we want to go to

212
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:50,820
our selves which then means we have to say Dot child and then we're going to do or we're going to have

213
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:58,350
to do the whole am off operation here so let's go back to snacks at Snap's activity because we've got

214
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:04,830
em off there we'll just copy and paste and then boom.

215
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,250
OK.

216
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,890
Also in Snap's activity we basically got all the way to where it is that we're trying to go so I'm actually

217
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:18,870
just going to copy all this code that gets us to the Snap's level for ourselves so when we come back

218
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,970
here and paste this in.

219
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,270
Right so we've got get to the database instance reference we go to users we get to the current users

220
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:33,630
you ID then we get to the Snap's and then we want to delete the particular snap here so then we're going

221
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:42,420
to say Dot and then this is where we want to do another child but we need to get the intent of from

222
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,980
the intent the snap key.

223
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,340
So we're going to say intent not get string extra.

224
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,010
And we want the one that we called SNAP key.

225
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,720
All right.

226
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,620
So once we've done that this part is really simple I love this.

227
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,990
We just say remove value and that's it.

228
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,280
It deletes it from the database.

229
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,750
That's really all we need.

230
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:09,150
I'll bring that back if you need a second here so after we go to the child where we you know figure

231
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,070
out what the snap key was we just simply say remove that and what it's going to do is it's going to

232
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,410
remove this whole thing right here.

233
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,330
So this whole snap with all of its information or if we deleted this one is going to delete the whole

234
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,300
thing.

235
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,490
So that's a database but what about the image side of things.

236
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,820
Well if we want to delete an image we're going to have to be working with firebase storage.

237
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:38,590
So when you file storage Dogget instance not get reference.

238
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,840
OK.

239
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,760
Then once we're there we want to get to the child of images right because everything is inside a folder

240
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,350
named images.

241
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,500
Then we want to get to the particular image.

242
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,510
So again we pass through the image name.

243
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:58,890
This is why we've included the image name as part of a snap so then we can say all right then go to

244
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,340
the child of intent get string extra.

245
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,540
We want the image name.

246
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,330
So this is that big long string of letters and numbers.

247
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,790
J bag so this will allow us to then go ahead and delete that.

248
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,470
So once we get to that whatever dot J pig will just simply say Dot delete.

249
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,010
I love the end of these two functions we have don't remove value delete.

250
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,580
This is just destruction going on here and it's excellent.

251
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,450
So this will go ahead and delete that information.

252
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,880
So let's go ahead and see what this looks like.

253
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,030
Spoiler alert there's still one more step for us to finish up here and if you can guess what it is.

254
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,470
Brownie points to you about why everything won't work perfectly but visually.

255
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,990
I mean on the back side of things you should see everything working so let's say let's view this now

256
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,300
from Joe.

257
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,830
So we'll click on it and oh we're looking at it it's great now I'm going to hit my back button.

258
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,870
Look at that.

259
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,660
It deletes it from the database.

260
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,900
And if we went and looked at it we would have seen the image delete this well let's do this again with

261
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,870
like the next one here.

262
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,540
So if I click on Nick right.

263
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,910
So I'm going to you should see this disappear.

264
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,960
But also the image this named six a D.

265
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,710
So just kind of remember that six a d f.

266
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:25,510
And in fact I guess if we wanted to really show this here let's open storage in a new tab we can see

267
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,520
both these things disappear.

268
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,460
So if we go into our images look there's that 6 ADF which is this image right here.

269
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,410
So once we hit the back button here that deletes from the database and if we go over here and reload

270
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,040
this page you will see downturn.

271
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,440
That image is gone.

272
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,060
So we've successfully cleaned up everything from the snap the image connected with it and then also

273
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,080
the database information.

274
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,480
Now you'll notice we have viewed these things they're deleted.

275
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:03,370
But when we come here they still show up and if we were to you know log out log back in it would show

276
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,150
empty just like we were hoping for.

277
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:11,740
But we need to add a little bit more code and that's if we go back to our Snap's activity here inside

278
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,280
of this on child remove.

279
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,540
So whenever something gets deleted this function gets called.

280
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:23,080
This is where we can appropriately say hey we've got to go remove a snap from the snaps array list and

281
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,760
we also got to remove something from the e-mails a re list came.

282
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,700
So what we're going to do is inside of here first we've got to detect and see if we're working with

283
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,920
the correct kind of snap.

284
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,340
So in order to do all of this we're going to create a for loop.

285
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:49,090
So we're going to say for let's get our curly brackets so for SNAP which is going to be of type data

286
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,870
a snapshot in Snap's.

287
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:59,170
Right because that's an array list here of data snapshot objects.

288
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:06,740
So for SNAP we want to go ahead and check and see if this particular snap that we're looking at in the

289
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,370
array list if it's key is equal to.

290
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:18,710
We want to see if it's equal to this p o here which is a data snapshot if it's equal to that key.

291
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:25,000
So if it's equal to zero dot key just like that we'll have to put a little question mark here.

292
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,690
But you might be wondering hey why is it that we can just say if a snap is equal to zero.

293
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:39,310
Well the problem with that is that they're not exactly the same object like they are in the Java world

294
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,390
they're a little bit different but the keys we can compare keys and if those are the same then we know

295
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,690
we can delete it.

296
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,860
So if that's the case if these are the same then we're going to want to go ahead and remove these from

297
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:57,640
the appropriate array list for both the e-mails and the Snap's right and our two array lists here.

298
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:06,700
So for the Snap's right we're going to say Snap's dot remove at and when we do this remove at we have

299
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,770
to know what index it is that we're at.

300
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:15,910
So we're going to kind of do a little cheat here where we're going to say var index is equal to zero.

301
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,940
We're going to make this little variable here.

302
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,990
And after the end of the state will say index plus plus.

303
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,790
So it might have been better to do a for loop where we you know said I's equal to zero blah blah blah.

304
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,590
But this is kind of a little fun way to do this index.

305
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,420
There we go.

306
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:38,500
But now we since we're keeping track the index of how we're looping through here we can say remove at

307
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,620
index pass that through.

308
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:47,380
Same thing goes for the e-mails we can see e-mails that remove at and pass in the index.

309
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,670
So this should be everything that we need.

310
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:56,940
Let's go ahead and run this big big moment here for us.

311
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:06,740
App is opening up and just for fun here just because let's go back in our database.

312
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,750
There's no Snap's.

313
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,030
I'm going to race everything out of because remember we had created a few images without you know connecting

314
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,590
them to a Snap's I'm going to select everything here.

315
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,810
Delete it all just so we're at a completely clean slate.

316
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,320
So you know let's do the full process here.

317
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,460
I'm going to log in and in fact I'll make a new user.

318
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:34,030
I'm going to make Laura at Zappy code dot com password.

319
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,310
BCT one two three four.

320
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,320
This will create a new user for us which if we go to the database look at that.

321
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,050
Oh we have somebody new.

322
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,480
We will then create a snap.

323
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,780
I'm going to choose an image.

324
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,350
Oh look this square looks nice.

325
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,140
I'll say a message.

326
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,920
We did it.

327
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,460
Exclamation point.

328
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,370
Super happy face x happy face then will hit next.

329
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,670
This will upload the image.

330
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,250
So to check this out go ahead reload here.

331
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,680
Should see an image now.

332
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,380
Yes that looks good.

333
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,750
Then we're going to say who should we send this to send it to ourselves so we can see this.

334
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,820
We'll go ahead and select that.

335
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,550
Boom.

336
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,220
There's something in the database and already it's showing for us here inside of our Snap's activity.

337
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,040
Look and it should have all of this information inside of it.

338
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,110
With that we did it in our funny faces so we'll select this.

339
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,430
Look at that shows the message shows the image.

340
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,300
Now watch as we hit the back button that gets deleted.

341
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,960
And oh it still shows here.

342
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,410
Also I built this all up.

343
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,050
It didn't even work well.

344
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,140
That's because we forgot to notify the list adapter that we needed to update things.

345
00:24:52,140 --> 00:25:00,590
So what we're going to do is after we've done this will then go ahead and say OK after you've done your

346
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:08,960
cool re loop for loop or whatever we need to get our adapter and say notify data set change.

347
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:14,540
It was going to be so cool to show you that we had all of that but just to prove that everything's gone

348
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:22,490
here over on the storage side of things there should be no images and no images.

349
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,890
So I won't go through the full process again I'll just very quickly create a snap here.

350
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,200
So we'll pick a cool image say boy.

351
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,240
This time not as graceful but it to Laura which sends it to ourselves.

352
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,750
Oh look.

353
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,230
There it is.

354
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,200
I select it.

355
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,320
A nice nap and moment of truth that the back button.

356
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,250
It's gone.

357
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,720
We deleted it.

358
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:48,830
OK.

359
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,590
Well congratulations.

360
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,740
You finished it.

361
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,070
We have a fully functional snap chat up.

362
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,400
This is probably one of the most difficult apps that we've built to date.

363
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,290
And we did it with the new technology of firebase and Cartland So pretty cool that you got to cover

364
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,780
a whole lot of different things with a really complex app.

365
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,290
You know should be one of the crown jewels that you keep inside of your folder of all your Android studio

366
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,220
projects but excited to see where you go from here.

367
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,430
Maybe you have your own social network that you're trying to create or an app that just requires a back

368
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,980
end.

369
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,720
I'm sure you can do great things with this so congratulations and thanks for coming along.
