1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,410
Excellence so you've now installed and or a studio and you're hopefully presented with the Welcome screen

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,860
here as you can see there are lots of options here.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,210
Most of which are reasonably self-explanatory but we're going to dive straight in and start a new Android

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,720
studio project.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,550
This takes us to the first of a few options screens.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,650
Let's start by filling in the application name and for now we'll just call it example app.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,600
The next option is to select your company Dumaine.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,250
Now at this point in your Android development career you probably don't have your own domain name but

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,960
don't worry you can really put anything you like here for now though when you start publishing apps

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,190
you will need to have a unique domain.

11
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,830
So if you like you can leave that as the example that you're given.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,550
Or you can change it to really whatever you like.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm going to change it to rob my app company dot com just to show you that you can use literally anything

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,460
you like here.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,970
Then you can choose where the project is saved on your harddrive.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,490
I'm just going to use the default location if you want to you can edit the package name just created

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,710
from your company domain and the name of your app.

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,830
But generally I would leave that as the default as it might cause confusion later if you do change it.

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,120
And down here you can choose to include C++ or Kollin support.

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,290
We'll be looking at Cartland later on in the course but we're not using it yet.

21
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,410
So you can leave both of those blank.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,710
All right click next and you can now choose the form factors and minimum SDK so form factors are reasonably

23
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,270
straightforward.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,370
If you're developing an app which is going to be used on phone and tablets which you probably are then

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:48,530
select the first option and the options down here we've got android where Android TV and 2.0 and Android

26
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,750
things if you're developing for those platforms you would select those a slightly trickier question

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,240
is which API version to use.

28
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,250
Now if you look at the drop down menu you can see that the various API versions correspond to the different

29
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,530
versions of Android that are out there.

30
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:11,120
So the later version you choose the more recent functions and features will be available to you but

31
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,490
the fewer devices your app will run on because a lot of devices are still running onsite lollipop.

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:26,780
So if we select Android 6 marshmallow you can see that we can use any API from 23 and later but your

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,090
app will only run on about 40 percent of devices.

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,710
So it's a choice that you'll need to make.

35
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,450
But most of the time and at least in the early stages of your app development career you probably won't

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,970
bump into too many features that you need but don't have.

37
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,420
So let's stick with API 15 for now.

38
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,620
Click next and were given the option to add a default activity now an activity on Android is essentially

39
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,800
a screen.

40
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,420
So as you build variety of different apps you'll be adding different types of activities to your apps.

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,130
You can see we've got some examples there.

42
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,850
So you might start your app with a basic activity and then when the user wants to do something on a

43
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,450
map will jump to a Google Maps activity you can see there's a full screen activity.

44
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,270
Various other types of activity that we'll see later on as we go through the course.

45
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:23,310
For now they will just choose an empty activity so a very simple one get started and click next.

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,180
And this is our final option screen where we're allowed to name our activity.

47
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,460
The default for your initial activity is main activity.

48
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,920
So we're going to leave that as it is and the layout you can see the name for that is just the name

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,630
but reversed.

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,690
So activity underscore main Those are the defaults.

51
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,480
So we leave them as they are and click next.

52
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,520
You might find that there's some new components that have been installed to allow you to create your

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,600
app for that particular version of Android.

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,440
So if you do then click Finish.

55
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:01,430
And finally Android studio itself should boot up and create your example App project.

56
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,250
And here we go.

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,910
Your first glimpse of Android studio now for me Android studio has opened two default files here.

58
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
But you might not be able to see those.

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,910
It doesn't always open up the same default files when you create a new project.

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,980
So I'm just going to close everything down.

61
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,340
Clicking the X is there.

62
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,400
And there.

63
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,860
And I'm going to click project just to get us back to a completely empty screen.

64
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,470
I'd recommend doing the same.

65
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,130
So we're all at the same starting point.

66
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,490
So you can see we've got lots of different options here.

67
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,070
But part of the skill of learning to code is working out what's important and what's not particularly

68
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,220
at the early stages of your journey.

69
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,370
So at the top here we've got the file structure of our app leading to that main activity file that I

70
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,450
showed you a moment ago.

71
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,370
And then over here on the right we've got a number of different options.

72
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,000
The most important and the most exciting is this playbook which we'll be using in a minute to actually

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,790
run our app feel free to hover over these other buttons if you like to get a bit more information about

74
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,040
what they are.

75
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:11,200
But don't worry too much at this point want to keep it simple and then round the edge.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,880
We've got some buttons.

77
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:20,500
All of which we'll be using at some point in the course but for the moment we're going to focus on the

78
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,110
project button which allows us to view our project.

79
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,410
Now we've got two key folders here.

80
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:35,050
We've got app and graded scripts cradle is an open source app building to Android studio uses to build

81
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,990
your app later on in the course.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,640
We're going to be customizing these great old build scripts to customize and add features to our apps

83
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,660
but for the moment we can just leave those as they are.

84
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,450
So let's have a look inside the app folder.

85
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,180
So I've got three folders here.

86
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,470
The first is manifests which has a single file in it called Android manifest Let's have a quick look

87
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,860
at that one.

88
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,760
This is what's known as an X M-L file and it contains information about your app so you can see we've

89
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,420
got the app name there.

90
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,430
We've got details about the icons the package name and various other bits and pieces.

91
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,130
We'll be editing this later on just like with the greatest scripts to add features.

92
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:21,170
But for now we can pop that back in its folder and leave it as is of more interest at this point is

93
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,280
the java folder which is where the code for our app resides.

94
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,780
There's three folders within that these are test folders which we won't be using again.

95
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,330
Right now the one we're really interested in is that top folder which has a single file in it.

96
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,510
The main activity file and as I mentioned earlier this is some Java code which creates and sets up the

97
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,330
main activity in our app.

98
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,460
We'll be looking at that in much more detail in the next couple of videos.

99
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:55,150
And finally we have Reade's short for resources fold up which is where we keep things like images and

100
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,820
music.

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,170
Most importantly to us right now is the layout subfolder within That's where we can see this activity

102
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,500
main direct XML file.

103
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,330
And if you DoubleClick that you can actually see a visual representation of your app and this is where

104
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,380
you get started editing the actual content of the app and the layout.

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,680
So we're going to spend a lot of time in activity main Torex M-L working with layout and in main activity

106
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,820
working with some Java to actually make your app do things.

107
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,160
So feel free to take a moment to play around here and maybe add some buttons to your app and see what

108
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,270
effect it has.

109
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,250
Have a look at the different widgets that are available.

110
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,660
Different type of text views.

111
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,990
There's a lot that you can add to your app from there.

112
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,820
You might also want to see how your app would look on different devices.

113
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:51,080
So we've got a nexus 4 by default there but we can try the pixel fine.

114
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:59,200
We can look at some bigger resolution devices like the Nexus 9 and we can even look at watches or TV

115
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,500
screens.

116
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,340
We'll leave it on nexus for now.

117
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,530
But feel free again to play around with that.

118
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:13,210
And also you can see where your app would look like in landscape mode and switch back and forth as well.

119
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,860
So there's a huge amount you can do here.

120
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,010
Most of which we're going to look at at various points during the course but for now let's just try

121
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:24,620
and run our example app on a phone within the emulator and Android studio.

122
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:31,310
So we click the green play button there and here we get the screen that allows us to select the device

123
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,510
that we want the app to run on.

124
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:39,050
I don't have any phones or devices connected so we need to use a virtual device because I've only just

125
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,270
installed Android studio only to create a new one.

126
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,620
So let's do that create new virtual device.

127
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,880
And so this is very exciting you can choose any phone you like and you'll have an emulator for it and

128
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:59,510
you can use it right there within your computer and you can create a TV emulator an Android where emulator

129
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,300
and it's happy I might as well so I'm going to use the options as much as possible so we'll stick with

130
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,280
Nexus 5 x.

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,410
But really you can choose whichever one you like here.

132
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,970
Click next.

133
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,840
And now we get an option to flex a system image.

134
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,850
So what kind of Android do we want our device to run.

135
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,280
I'm going to go for the latest version of the recording of this video but at this point you're welcome

136
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,220
to try out other versions of Android If you prefer.

137
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:34,000
You'll likely have to download the version unless it's already installed.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,290
So I click accept accept the terms and conditions and again it will take a few minutes to install and

139
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:40,600
there we go.

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,890
So that's installed.

141
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,750
Click finish.

142
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,680
And then you should be able to select the version that you've downloaded next.

143
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,570
It's just a summary of the options that you've selected.

144
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,580
A few advance settings we'll be using later on in the course.

145
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,460
But for now we'll leave those all that he felt and click Finish.

146
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,060
That will then set up our Android virtual device.

147
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,390
And we can select it and click OK.

148
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,790
And there it is.

149
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,660
So it'll pop up on our screen we can control it using the icons then we do have to then wait for our

150
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,970
app to build using cradle.

151
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,140
And we'll also have to wait for the emulator to start up.

152
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:33,700
Here we go so our app is built with zero errors and our phone is just beating up the.

153
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,670
And here we go.

154
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,930
So the app is up and running.

155
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,470
You can see we've got a message here is to me why isn't responding.

156
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:45,310
That's just because the startup process is still going on by clicking wait usually just makes the message

157
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,120
go away.

158
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,500
So congratulations you've built and run your first Android app.

159
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,250
Obviously it doesn't do a great deal yet but that will change as we learn how to customize and code

160
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,540
our apps in the next few years.
