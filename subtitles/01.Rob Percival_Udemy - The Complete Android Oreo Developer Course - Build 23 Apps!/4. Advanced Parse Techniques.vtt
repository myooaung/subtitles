00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.340
In this lecture we're going to dive a little bit deeper into parts and learn how we can work with different

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.300
pieces there.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.750
And let's go ahead by starting back inside of our Android studio project.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.680
We need to clear out a little bit of code so all the code from this parse object where we make the example

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.240
object down to where we're logging what information we're going to delete all of that because that was

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.760
just a simple test to see if we could get things up and running.

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.200
And with that let's go ahead and move over to our main activity where we're going to be writing some

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.110
code in hopefully you get a good grasp on how you can add things to the parse server pull things back

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.280
down edit them if you need to.

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.930
We're going to cover all of that.

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.740
So the first thing that we want to talk about is how do we make a new object and have it stored inside

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.240
of parts.

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.080
Well first you have to create a class so a class if we go back to the browser here so you can see there's

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.300
a couple of classes here there's role use or those are ones created by default by parse.

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.280
But then we made the example object that we're going to make a new one here in this example scenario.

16
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.790
Let's say we're creating a video game and we want someone to be able to save their scores.

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.380
So what we're going to do is we're going to make a new class called SCORE.

18
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.090
And just remember a class is kind of like in S.

19
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.490
Q Well whenever we create a table it's if we go back to the browser here for example example object

20
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.680
if we think of this as a table these are then individual rows inside of a table and so they can have

21
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.980
you know different properties like my string my number whatever are score objects is going to have like

22
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.770
you know a score with it maybe a user name.

23
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.990
And so let's go ahead and walk through that.

24
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.530
So the first thing that we want to do is we want to create a new parse object and you can decide what

25
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.190
you want to name that in this case are going to call it score because we're trying to represent the

26
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.770
score so we're going to say new capital parse object and then inside of the parentheses you need to

27
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.340
pass in a string of the name of the class.

28
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.850
Now all classes and parses and parse need to be uppercase so make sure you do that.

29
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.620
Next we're going to take this score object and we're going to add some properties onto it so we're going

30
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.390
to say score dot put.

31
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.750
And this is where you can add in some information.

32
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.100
So the first thing is you have to provide the field name that you're going to be putting there.

33
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.580
So in this case let's say we want to add a user name we would add that first thing comma we would specify

34
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.270
what the specific user name is so I might say Nick here.

35
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.560
Then with this score we have to you know say what the actual score is.

36
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.230
So let's go ahead and do that we're going to stay put and we're going to say score for the name and

37
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.300
then we need to add an actual score there so let's do something like 45.

38
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.760
That was my score in this hypothetical videogame.

39
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.450
Now once you have this in place we need to actually take this score object and save it to parse and

40
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.270
partials made this super simple.

41
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.340
All we have to do.

42
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.610
So we just have to take our score object and say score dot and then save.

43
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.280
And there's all these different options there straight up save save eventually save in background and

44
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.430
for both eventually in background you have these callbacks which are.

45
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.450
We'll tell you about when it happens so you don't want to do the save one because that will sort of

46
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.560
pause your app until the save happens.

47
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.370
I recommend the save in background and particularly the one that has a callback because then you can

48
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.160
know whether or not things were successful.

49
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.670
So let's do Savon background and we're going to say we're going to create a new and we want to create

50
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.250
a new save callback.

51
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.110
And if you just hit enter it's going to autocomplete for you there and then the code inside of here

52
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.920
it'll provide this parse exception.

53
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.220
If there was some sort of issue so we can say you know first check and see if there's anything to this

54
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.420
exception that they gave us are going to say if he is equal to no.

55
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.710
Which if that was the situation situation that means everything is OK.

56
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.640
Else that would be you know something's gone wrong here and we need to know about it.

57
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.940
And so we could just take this B and do a print stack trace with that.

58
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.830
Now if it is OK we want somehow to you know let ourselves know that it all worked out.

59
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.990
So let's go ahead and just do a log on this.

60
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:31.440
So we're going to say log I mean we're going to say success and maybe we'll just mention here that we

61
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.710
saved the score.

62
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.970
So there you have it.

63
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.850
This is kind of the basics of all it takes to make a new object and parts we have to say the class that

64
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:42.980
we want to make.

65
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.340
We have to put in some properties there and then we have to save it.

66
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.980
OK.

67
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.140
So let's go ahead and hit run here on the emulator.

68
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.080
And with that let's go ahead and get that popped up and we should see over here that we're going to

69
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.030
have a new class called Score pop up with one item inside of there.

70
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.850
OK.

71
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.430
So this opened up if we go to log cat.

72
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.850
Look at that we saved the score.

73
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.270
And if we go back to the browser and refresh the page here look at that we have a new score class and

74
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.080
if we click on that.

75
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.840
Here's that one score that we created with a score of 45 in the name Nick.

76
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:30.990
Now if we go back to android studio let's go ahead and create a new score for someone named Shaun.

77
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.440
Score beat me or Shaun beat me on a score.

78
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.100
He has a score of like 65 let's say and we'll go ahead and run this because I just want you to see how

79
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.440
you can add multiple more objects that you add the more it's going to stack up here.

80
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.230
So let me reload this page now and look at that.

81
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.150
There's now two people inside of the score class and again think of this I think it's best to think

82
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.330
of it as you know as you well table write like this is the name of the table is score.

83
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.070
And then these are rows inside of the table and so you know these are individual instances of particular

84
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.000
scores.

85
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.180
All right so now that you've got a good grasp on that let's go ahead and move forward and talk about

86
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:18.680
how we can grab things from par so we're going to come back to our code and let's go ahead and just

87
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.630
comment out what we've done so far.

88
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.650
And then below we're going to talk about how we can get things from our server.

89
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:36.470
So in this situation we need to make a query so we're going to say parse and we want to query Yes better

90
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.100
just type that out better than scrolling through the whole thing there.

91
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.320
So this is going to be a parse query where we're looking to get a parse object back so we'll put that

92
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.960
inside the angle brackets.

93
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.520
And let's just go ahead and call this a query.

94
00:06:50.930 --> 00:07:00.470
And this is going to be equal to a capital parse query dot and this is where we want to say get queery

95
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.710
4 and you have to pass a class name here so if we want to get the score objects we would pass in capital

96
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.790
score then with that.

97
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.690
Now that we have this query object we can say queery dot get.

98
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.920
And there's all these options for getting background or get first in background.

99
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.380
We want to do the get in background so let's go ahead and do that.

100
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:29.720
With this we have to first specify the ID of the object that we want to get and you're saying Well what's

101
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.790
an object ID.

102
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.920
Well just like we had a primary key with the SU l database.

103
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:42.920
If we go back to the browser here every item inside of parce has an object id that uniquely identifies

104
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.010
it.

105
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:50.090
So any new row that's added here it's going to have a new object id like the example object any of these

106
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.420
things are going to have an object ID.

107
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:59.570
So for example if we want to grab the score for Nick with the score 45 we want to copy this object id

108
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.490
come back to our code and put that inside of quotes.

109
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.110
And that is going to go get us the particular object that we're looking for.

110
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:15.480
Now once we do that we want to go get a callback whenever we are able to successfully get this object.

111
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:22.030
So we're going to say you get a callback for a particular parse object just like that.

112
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:28.790
Let's make sure that we put semi-colon at the end of that and you'll see this method that we have here

113
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.920
gives us a parse object the one that we were hoping for unless something didn't work out in that case

114
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.560
we'd want to you know look to this exception for some help but this is where we can move forward.

115
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.400
So let's do an if statement to make sure we actually got an object back.

116
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:56.120
So the check that we'll do is we're going to say you know if E is equal to no and not 2 percent or size

117
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.860
or any of the number stamped so it's easy to know that I mean there was no air and as long as object

118
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:08.750
is not equal to nil this will assure us that we actually have an object that we can move forward with.

119
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:15.920
So if this is the case on this particular object you can get to its particular properties by saying

120
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.780
dot get.

121
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:22.380
And you just have to provide a string like for example if we wanted to get to up here we had said user

122
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:29.090
name and score we could type in username here and that would give us back the particular object that

123
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.690
we're looking for.

124
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.410
Now this just general does get usually isn't the best you want to do something like get a string.

125
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.970
If you're looking for a string.

126
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.850
So for the user name that would be a good one you know but if we're working with for example the score

127
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.770
we'd want to you know go get it.

128
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.840
But this is a good starting point.

129
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.880
So let's go ahead and log out this information.

130
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.760
So we're going to say a log.

131
00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:01.450
I will say maybe you just use name comma and then let's go ahead and cut paste that in there.

132
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.490
So now it's going to log out the username.

133
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.020
And let's also log out the score we're going to have to change this a bit but we're going to say score

134
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.390
should be instead of get string.

135
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:20.890
We want to get it but we still have to provide the term score right inside of there and then we've got

136
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:27.160
to turn this into strings or do a a to string with this.

137
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.690
Go ahead and wrap that around.

138
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.450
OK.

139
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.350
And I've got to go get that object.

140
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.280
There we go.

141
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.470
All right.

142
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:44.410
So this code should have us log out the user name and score for Nick because we put in that particular

143
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:51.550
object ID if we change the object id we should you know see Sean for example if we had put in his.

144
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.410
But let's go ahead and check this out.

145
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.080
And if we come down boom look there's Nick for 45.

146
00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.990
So just for kicks let's go grab the other object id paysite in there and run shall we.

147
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.090
So we should now see the information for Sean.

148
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:15.320
So let's go ahead and run this and come on we believe in you like that Sean with a score of 65.

149
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.370
Pretty cool.

150
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.320
Now you may be wondering how can I update an object once already happened so let's say we want to update

151
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.430
Sean's score.

152
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.610
He put even more of a beat down on me.

153
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:29.150
I think he got a higher score than he had before.

154
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.550
Well what we can do is for example here we can take this particular object that we got back and we can

155
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:41.990
just update some of this information so we can say you know put and let's change the score to be something

156
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.160
like 85.

157
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.400
Now like he had a huge jump up.

158
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.180
So go ahead and take that object.

159
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.170
We're going to put that new information now in order for that to be official.

160
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.010
Want to do our object save in background.

161
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.380
In this case I'm not really concerned about the callback.

162
00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.870
I just want to see if this works.

163
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.800
Let's go ahead and run this.

164
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.760
So there should be two points here one is that when we log this we should see the score updated to 85.

165
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.090
And that's not because the save happened super fast and we're able to get the right information but

166
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.240
this object here is now locally here inside of this function.

167
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.960
And so it's not like it's going to get in it from the internet and bringing it back.

168
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.080
But when we go and log it out like it will just show what we changed it to.

169
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.870
The real test will be when we look on the browser to see if it's there.

170
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.020
So let's open up blog cat.

171
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.910
Unexpectedly it said Shaun 85.

172
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.720
But the real test is Shawn's currently 65 we should see that up to 85.

173
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.230
Boom.

174
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.140
OK.

175
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.860
At a good place.

176
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.910
So the next thing for us is I have a challenge for you.

177
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.100
I want you to do a little bit of work here with working with some tweets.

178
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.700
I'm going to comment out this code.

179
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.680
I'm just going to update where that goes.

180
00:12:53.940 --> 00:13:03.840
And my new challenge for you is I want you to first create a tweet class game then I want you to make

181
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.490
a with that class.

182
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.870
They should have a user name and they should be able to tweet with that.

183
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:17.630
I want you to save it to parse after you've done that query it.

184
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.860
And lastly I want you to update the tweet.

185
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:29.250
So basically make a tweet class make sure it has a user name and a tweet save it to parse and then query

186
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.210
it and update it.

187
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.490
Basically what we just did before with the score stuff but now do it on your own and hopefully doing

188
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.340
this exercise on your own is going to make it that much more stuck in your brain.

189
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.200
All right so hopefully that went well.

190
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:49.610
Step number one for us is we want to make a new parse object type that out.

191
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:59.710
Now I'm going to call this tweet and this is going to be equal to capital parse object and or excuse

192
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:09.370
me in New parse object and or and a new class name that we are going to call capital tweet.

193
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.340
Then with this tweet we are going to put some information there so we're going to stay put.

194
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.030
Are going to say this person has a user name.

195
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.110
I'll put my Twitter handle.

196
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:26.270
Nick shuk Walter I know it's a really long one.

197
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.110
And then with this I'm also going to put a particular tweet.

198
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:38.680
So this is going to have the name of tweet and we'll give it the value of.

199
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.950
I like cheese Yeah.

200
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.690
Let the world know.

201
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:49.160
So with this in place we've got to save this tweet so I'm going to do dot save in background.

202
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.830
And I would like a callback about this are going to do new save callback.

203
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.890
Let's check and see if there was an error.

204
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.040
So we're going to set up an if statement say if he is equal to.

205
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:02.890
No.

206
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:09.100
That means everything's good song and a go ahead and log out.

207
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.830
OK.

208
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.750
And we'll say save success.

209
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.480
But if there was an issue we'll go ahead and just say whatever that air is.

210
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.400
Let's do a print stack trace.

211
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.540
We need to know about it.

212
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.480
OK.

213
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.570
So let's go ahead and run this.

214
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.950
See what we get from our emulator here.

215
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:36.540
Hopefully good news and then when we come back to Safari here and reload we should see that pop up.

216
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.500
So look at that we have saved success let's reload this page.

217
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.210
At that we have a tweet.

218
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.300
I like cheese by user name Nick.

219
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.790
Chuck Walter.

220
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:53.410
So we have completely completed the part of creating a tweet class username and tweet have been added

221
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.460
to it we've saved it.

222
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.460
Next we need to do a query with it.

223
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.530
So let's go ahead.

224
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.310
I mean we can basically just copy and paste the code that we had here before and just change out some

225
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:09.610
information so I'll go ahead and paste this from before I want to go get the particular tweets I'm going

226
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:15.290
to copy its object id and update that.

227
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.140
This is good this is doing the proper check.

228
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:22.780
Now with this we don't want to do the update stuff just yet so I'm going to go ahead and comment that

229
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:29.200
I don't we still want to get the username but rather than getting the score we want to get the tweet

230
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.100
which is a string.

231
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:38.050
So I'm going to copy this line of code and paste the below and just change this to be tweaked.

232
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:44.950
Also change this to be tweaked so we don't run this it should be able to log out the tweet that we have

233
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:50.700
saved the one that said I like cheese and also said you know say who it was that posted it.

234
00:16:50.710 --> 00:17:04.980
So here comes the app and look at that save success and not seen that information so I'm not completely

235
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.750
sure oh this is the problem when you copy and paste.

236
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:15.290
You got to be really careful So this is looking for the score class I need this to be the tweet class.

237
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:23.750
So let's go ahead and run this one more time and we should hopefully now see the correct information.

238
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.170
So here it comes.

239
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.240
And boom look at that Nick.

240
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:27.990
Check Walter.

241
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.530
I like cheese.

242
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.840
So we know that that's OK and I guess every time that we've been running we've been making more and

243
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.230
more tweets.

244
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.590
So that's kind of funny.

245
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.720
They all say I like cheese so whatever.

246
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:46.050
Last step for us we need to update the tweet so we had code here to update the object.

247
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:51.660
This one is updating the score so rather than swar score we want to update the tweet to say something

248
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.010
like cheese is ok.

249
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:02.030
Maybe I posted that now because I'm suddenly lactose intolerant or something like that.

250
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:11.460
So go ahead and hit run here check to see if we get the new tweet message here and we should see you

251
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.160
know the tweet updated so that cheeses OK.

252
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.720
Now I want you to see this.

253
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.530
The idea of X capital ETF will come back.

254
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.410
So if I reload X ETF should show Cheese's OK.

255
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.690
And look at that x ETF now says geez.

256
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:29.250
OK.

257
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.670
So hopefully you got a good grasp on this.

258
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.920
I think you're ready to move forward and start making this Instagram app.
