00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.540
All right so I have a challenge for you in this lecture.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.740
So we want to take the things that we learned about the map and the things that we learned about finding

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.440
the user's location and merge them together.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
So I want you to make an app that will track the user's location so when they open the app for the very

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.010
first time it will show where they are on a map.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.140
Use one of those cool little red markers and then if they ever change the location update that marker

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.910
to be wherever it is that they are OK.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.100
So this is a challenge for you because I believe you have the tools that you need to get all this done

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.110
that might be a few things that you have to google but you can totally do this.

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.820
So as a challenge go ahead and hit pause now go do it on your own.

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.930
OK.

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.160
So hopefully that went well for you.

13
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.720
I'm going to walk you through just in case you ran into some issues or had questions just want to see

14
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.130
how I did it.

15
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.190
So we're going to start a new Android studio project and I'm going to go ahead and call this map and

16
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.400
location demo.

17
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.240
We want Android at least 23 there and then I will start with the Google Maps activity because I want

18
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.460
access all that ass awesome map setup right like it creates the fragment and it's all there it starts

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.500
to code about making an annotation.

20
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.200
Great stuff there.

21
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.280
So step number one for us is we've got to include our API so you can go back to our previous project

22
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.710
or for me.

23
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.330
Luckily I have this API key right here ready to go so I'm just going to go ahead and copy that.

24
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.130
OK.

25
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.980
And I'm going to come back to our project and remember that I'll just put this right here.

26
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.950
Now it's important to remember that if you're using your key here you've got to make sure that you've

27
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.770
either updated it with your new package that you're working with here.

28
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.150
Right like if you're to Android apps and you do all this stuff but I just recommend putting on one so

29
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.000
that you can use this API key for all your different Android apps.

30
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.120
Again when you push to the apple or to the Google Play store you want to restrict it to just your app

31
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.830
for the time being.

32
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.880
This is OK.

33
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.920
All right so once you've got that in place let's go ahead and move back to our project here.

34
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.270
Now the next thing that we're going to want to make sure that we have connected is the permission in

35
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.700
order to use the map.

36
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.760
But in fact are not a map a user's location.

37
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.590
But when we start with an android or a Google Maps activity it automatically asks this for us so puts

38
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.880
that inside the Android manifest so we don't even have to worry about that so that's pretty nice that

39
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.660
we can just close out of that and not have to worry about it anymore.

40
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.710
So the next thing that we want to do is set up our classic location manager and our location service.

41
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.180
So we're going to go up here or listener excuse me sort of first going to make a location manager that

42
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.450
will call location manager.

43
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.790
We're going to make a location listener will call location listener.

44
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.690
So now that we have access to those we want them to be all set up inside of our own create method here.

45
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:17.290
So in the uncreate first we'll set up the manager will say location manager is equal to this get system

46
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:27.850
service and inside of here want to do capital context dot location service and we need to make sure

47
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.340
that we cast this appropriately by saying this should be a location manager.

48
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.370
All right.

49
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.050
Next up for us we want to update or set up the location listener will say location listener is equal

50
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.750
to a new location listener and this adds all that code there for us.

51
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.220
So inside of here rather than doing a blog let's sort of mix things up a little bit.

52
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.070
Let's go ahead and use a toast instead.

53
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.640
So we'll just go ahead and type capital toast.

54
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.390
Make a text.

55
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.360
And first what we're going to provide is our maps.

56
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.650
Activity this so we make sure that you know it's going to the correct place there so that's a little

57
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.210
bit different that we've done with some toast.

58
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.530
Next thing that we're going to do is we're going to get our current location and we are going to take

59
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.570
that location turn it into a string that's what we want to show in the toast.

60
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.230
Lastly we can decide how long we want this toast to show for.

61
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.100
So I'm going to do.

62
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.010
Length short.

63
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.910
That's my favorite and I'm not going to forget this time.

64
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.460
I'm going to do a show on the end so that this toast actually shows up.

65
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.890
I swear every time I make one I think well didn't that work.

66
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.830
Well because I never showed it.

67
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.520
That's what the issue was.

68
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.900
So with that in place after we have the location manager and the listener all set up they will need

69
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.560
a semi-colon there.

70
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.600
Then it's time for us to see if you know the user has given us permission and if not we need to go request

71
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.990
it right.

72
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.340
All that good information.

73
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.660
So something that I do want to point out here is let's say a user is not using the you know at least

74
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.560
Android marshmallow which is what we've required here or at least is what we're building here.

75
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.650
What we can do is we can do a cool little if statement where we say if and the thing that we're going

76
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.540
to check here for is what version of Android they're running so we're going to say capital build not

77
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.020
capital.

78
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:34.030
And this is an all caps version dot and we want to get the SDK and sort of say if this thing is less

79
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.470
than 23 meaning that's the you know version we had chosen when we created this project they're saying

80
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.900
if it's less than that we don't have to go through the whole process of manually asking for the location.

81
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.260
We just have to say hey.

82
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.470
Location Manager.

83
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.150
You know go get updates and all that good stuff and it's going to automatically ask the user.

84
00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:01.130
So this is where we could say location manager that request location updates and we'll go ahead and

85
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:09.860
pass in our location manager dot GPS provider Khama will do zero and zero because we want all the updates

86
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.700
will pass and location listener.

87
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.740
OK so we've got all those pieces in there ready to rock and roll.

88
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.150
And let's see here call to check oh so we've got to make sure that we have the permission check.

89
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.330
So.

90
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.550
Well before we do all this we're going to do this in a separate step here so we're going to give him

91
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.720
the lead that just for a second here.

92
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.590
So we're going to do an else in this situation.

93
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.980
So we're going to say if we weren't able to go ahead and get this what we want to do is we want to check

94
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.330
and see if we've gotten permission.

95
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:53.390
So we're going to come down here and say if and this is where we'll do our check and say context compact

96
00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:02.660
check self permission and inside of here we're going to pass this and then we're going to give the manifest

97
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.290
not permission.

98
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.710
And this is where we want to access the fine location.

99
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:17.180
So we're going to see if this thing is not equal to the Permission granted so we're going to say package

100
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.950
manager permission granted and look at that it already has it sort of queued up for us.

101
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:31.490
So good we get that checked there make sure that everything's ready to rock and roll then if that is

102
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.850
the case that you know we didn't get permission we need to go and request it.

103
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:45.020
So we're going to say activity compact request permissions and we'll go ahead and provide this K and

104
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:53.510
then with that then ask for the manifest not permission.

105
00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:00.130
And this is where we want to get to the Access fine location.

106
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.620
Excellent.

107
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.730
And with that.

108
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.980
Excuse me we did this a little bit out of place so before we do this manifest stuff this is where we

109
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:16.210
want to say we need a new string array and we'll do our opening curly bracket there for that.

110
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.820
And the one there.

111
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.850
Then lastly we just need a number for this.

112
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.960
We're going to put in the number one.

113
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.870
OK.

114
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.200
So we've got that there.

115
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.830
And we're going to provide an ELSE situation.

116
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:33.440
So on this else it's basically saying hey if they've already given us permission then we just want to

117
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.380
go ahead and say you know what.

118
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:41.660
Go ahead and request location services all that good stuff so go ahead and paste that there.

119
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.600
All right so now with this in place let's go ahead and give our app a quick run.

120
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.420
All right so we have our request showing up here but I'm not going to say allow just yet.

121
00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:01.240
I'm going to come back to our code and I want to write the code for if someone is you know has provided

122
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.990
the yes or no answer to that question I'm hopefully not going to squash my opportunity here.

123
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.690
So we're going to type out on request permission.

124
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.360
Result.

125
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.830
OK.

126
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:17.260
So this brings in that huge method and what we're going to do inside of here is first we're going to

127
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.050
I'm going to show you how you can work with that request code if you'd like.

128
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:28.090
So right we had given this the request code of the number one right here so we can do a quick check

129
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:36.970
on that and just say OK if request code is equal to the number one that means that we can move forward

130
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.840
because we're working with the appropriate request because this could be asking for all different kinds

131
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.190
of permissions and you know these request codes is how we keep track of that.

132
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.810
Again we only have one but this is probably just a little safe thing to do.

133
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.210
Next thing that we want to do is see if they said yes to us.

134
00:09:52.360 --> 00:10:03.970
So we're going to say if let's get that all set up and we need Grant results length is greater than

135
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:04.900
zero.

136
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:14.890
And we also want to check and see if Grant results at the zero position me in that first object in the

137
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:21.270
array is equal to package manager not permission granted.

138
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:21.660
OK.

139
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.600
So this does our checks to see if they've gone ahead and given that to us.

140
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.140
We also need to do another check just like we have down below here so I'm going to go ahead and copy

141
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.700
that.

142
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.260
We go ahead and give us some space so we can actually see what we're doing.

143
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.230
Okay.

144
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.630
We're going to see if we can get this we need to change this to see if this is equal to.

145
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.610
Permission granted.

146
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:51.310
So if the permission has been granted then that we are now safe to say let's go ahead and check the

147
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.250
location.

148
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.340
So we're in a location manager request location updates.

149
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:06.300
And again we'll just say Location Manager dot GPX Yes provider 0 0 and we'll put in our location Lessner.

150
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.450
So that's got everything that we need inside of there.

151
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:17.680
Let's go ahead and then we are getting some errors here and wondering if I don't have enough ending

152
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.550
curly brackets.

153
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.210
There we go.

154
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.340
Looks like that fixed the situation.

155
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:28.780
So let's go ahead and run this and we'll see if we can get an update about this information via a toast.

156
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.780
So go ahead.

157
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.640
Wait for the app to open.

158
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.530
I'm going to wait until this shows up with the app in the background because I don't want to get all

159
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.780
Punkt out again.

160
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.020
And we're going to try loading this one more time yes restart the app

161
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.950
it when we don't even have to open up blog yet since we're doing this via toast OK.

162
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:59.540
So for whatever reason this just absolutely refuses to show me the app until I say allow for this.

163
00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.210
Well go ahead and do that.

164
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.960
And let's let's open up the app here.

165
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.490
So we've called this map and location.

166
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.940
Oh no it doesn't.

167
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.120
The names are too long there.

168
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.990
All right well we've written the code that it should work.

169
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.450
I always botch that.

170
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:21.330
I guess I should have just waited to run it until I was ready to try that all out.

171
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.140
And if you ever want to get that situation again you can always delete the app from your phone and that'll

172
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.780
do that.

173
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:34.430
But let's go ahead into our menu here and on the emulator here let's go ahead and send some latitude

174
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.840
and longitude and look at that.

175
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.300
It shows up right there inside of the toast just like we were hoping for.

176
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.440
Excellent stuff.

177
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.070
OK.

178
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.720
So that's showing up.

179
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.640
That's you know definitely a step in the right direction.

180
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:52.390
But what we want to do is wherever the user's location is we want to move this little marker to be in

181
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.560
that location.

182
00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:01.060
So what we're going to do is we're going to come down here and and I guess something that I should also

183
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:06.730
mention we don't want to run this code with the location manager and everything until we actually have

184
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.760
the map ready to rock and roll.

185
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.550
So let's go ahead and down here below where we have this code.

186
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:24.670
I'm going to copy all of this and or I guess cut it rather and I'm going to paste it down here because

187
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.560
you know we don't want to try and update the user's location right before the map is ready so it's just

188
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:36.930
kind of a nice thing to do there but instead of us when we have used it's location rather than doing

189
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.630
a toast.

190
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:43.060
Let's go ahead and do the code of you know making one of these markers so I'm going to cut this marker

191
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:49.000
code and we'll just go ahead and paste it right here.

192
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.600
Now we're not doing the Sydney thing so we're going to remove that comment from here.

193
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:59.620
But basically we still need to make latitude and longitude here lat Lang and I'm just going to call

194
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:07.180
this user location K and rather than it just being a static always negative 34 and 151.

195
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:17.080
What I'm going to do is I'm going to use the location object that we have a location get latitude and

196
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.010
location get longitude.

197
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.150
So this was something that I thought maybe you know if you were doing this as a challenge you probably

198
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.080
would have had to google this part to say hey you know how do I get the latitude and longitude from

199
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.560
location.

200
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.990
But it also may have just been into it enough to say oh maybe it's somewhere in this location object.

201
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:40.690
So let's go ahead and copy this use a location so that we update it here and it zooms into the correct

202
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.300
place.

203
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:48.190
Rather than seeing marker in Sydney it's probably more appropriate if we say something like your location

204
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.260
so that we can go ahead and see that.

205
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.230
So with that in place let's go ahead and hit run here.

206
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.560
And we'll wait for this to pop up

207
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:09.740
OK so here comes the app and let's send in a location like this and boom like that apparently we're

208
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.960
right at the top of it because Pakistan and Russia.

209
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.140
But you know let's put maybe if I change longitude to zero.

210
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.600
Boom.

211
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.170
All sudden.

212
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.360
Look at that we're in the UK.

213
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.320
Hello Rob.

214
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.460
Let's go to 0 0 see what that's like.

215
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.800
Oh we're over here somewhere in Africa.

216
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.960
Maybe provide something like 10 there.

217
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.300
Look at that.

218
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.540
Moves us up just a bit and we could do 20.

219
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.850
That's pretty cool.

220
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:39.890
So we have a little bit of an issue right now and that's that we're always having these new locations

221
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:45.890
show up time and time again which we don't want and so our way to fix that is we need to clear the map

222
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.470
before we add something.

223
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.520
So we're just going a little bit of code right here that we can access this map so we're going to say

224
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.800
map.

225
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.460
Clear.

226
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.430
And that basically just gets everything out of the map so we'll go ahead.

227
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.860
Test this out make sure it's all OK.

228
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.880
All right and we'll wait for this to open up

229
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.910
around.

230
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.020
So I'm going to send a location like that will move it down 10 and look at that.

231
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.120
Deleted the old one moved us to the new location.

232
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.480
And that's really good.

233
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.320
So that's all great but there's still one more issue and that's you might have noticed when we open

234
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.870
the up to the very first time it didn't show any location and that's because you know it's waiting for

235
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.160
one of those updates and stuff.

236
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.380
So what we can do is we can get the user's last known location right when the app opens up and we can

237
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.490
use that in order to say hey OK you know they've given us the information.

238
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.560
Let's go ahead and grab that.

239
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.230
So the code that we would write for that is here inside of the else statement.

240
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:44.660
Right.

241
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.600
Assuming that we have the permission and everything's ready to rock and roll.

242
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:53.490
This is where we would want to go get the user's location and do all this stuff.

243
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:59.380
So we're going to make a new location and we'll just call this location.

244
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.820
And this is going to be well I guess rather than location let's be specific.

245
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.670
This is the last known location.

246
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:17.370
And this is going to be equal to we're going to access our location manager dot and on this we want

247
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.710
to do yet.

248
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:26.160
Last known location and inside of here we've got to say that we want it through the GPS location manager

249
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.000
got GPS GPS provider.

250
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.060
So that gives us the last known location.

251
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:37.200
And then at that point it's really just the same code as you know clearing the map adding these things

252
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.220
are going to go ahead and copy this piece down below.

253
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:46.020
And instead of location we'll use last known location so we could have gotten away if we had said last

254
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.440
known location or named that location.

255
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.890
But I think it's probably good to be clear here about what it is.

256
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.160
We're working with.

257
00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.880
And let's go ahead and check this out.

258
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.660
So I'll run this on the app and this is important.

259
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.350
We want to see what it looks like when we open it up for the very first time and look at that.

260
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:10.320
It and used our last position but now you know we can go ahead and update things and I'm going to see

261
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.480
if I can't get us into the U.S. Let's see.

262
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.680
I'm going to try.

263
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.710
Negative 50 here you were practically there.

264
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.780
Let's do maybe like negative 80.

265
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:26.400
Let's get a little bit more west here so that will get us in the U.S. Now we just need to up our latitude

266
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.560
maybe to like 50 up to high and count it.

267
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.270
OK we'll come down and look at that.

268
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.960
We are in Illinois.

269
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.640
Let's do like negative 100.

270
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.340
Bam.

271
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.690
All of sudden we're in.

272
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.970
I don't know where we are.

273
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.470
Let's do 120 I want to see if I can get us in California.

274
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.190
Look at that.

275
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.040
I got this in California maybe on the border of negative 121 just to make sure.

276
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.960
Now we're probably at like Google headquarters or something like that in Northern California.

277
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.420
Anyway.

278
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:59.270
I really enjoy playing around with the stuff that I make if you haven't figured that out already.

279
00:18:59.370 --> 00:18:59.760
OK.

280
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.260
Well hopefully you enjoyed this.

281
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.650
I have one more location skill that I want to teach you.

282
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:09.330
And then we're going to go make this awesome hiking app that's going to tie it all together but one

283
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.620
more new skill for you to learn.

284
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.820
Coming in the next lecture.
