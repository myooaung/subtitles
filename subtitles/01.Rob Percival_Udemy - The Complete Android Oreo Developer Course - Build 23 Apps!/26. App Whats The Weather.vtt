00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.290
Hello and welcome to the section where we're going to build a app called What's the weather.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.100
And here's the app in a nutshell you should be able to type in any city in the world for example if

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.010
I want to know what's the weather like in.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.980
Hi I can go ahead and type the sentence going to say hey there's moderate rain there's some mist if

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.860
I want to do any or any other sort of city let's say I want to figure out what it's like in Tokyo.

6
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.010
I can type in Tokyo Oh there's broken clouds there.

7
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.870
OK.

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.400
So this is sort of our end result.

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.560
What we want you to use is the open weather map API that we had done before in fact don't kill yourself

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.070
by rewriting all that API code you can use a lot of the code from the last project for this one.

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.340
Also you can notice I have this really cool background image here.

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.170
I got that from an splash dot com they've got a bunch of awesome images that you're free to use and

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.400
don't require you know pain for them or attribution so you can learn all about that here and go get

14
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.030
the images that you want and go see them.

15
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.340
So anyways with that you should be able to get this app completed on your own.

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.050
Of course if you'd like to see how I did it you can watch with me through the rest of the lecture.

17
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.430
Best of luck.

18
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.690
All right.

19
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.440
Let's go ahead and get started here we're going to make a new androids to your project and we're going

20
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.980
to call this.

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.110
What's the weather.

22
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.540
And I didn't put out an apostrophe in here.

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.610
Any type of punctuation that you have with your Android project name it can really affect the packages

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.820
and can get nasty so spaces are OK but anything outside of that punctuation wise I'd really recommend

25
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.600
against.

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.950
So we'll go ahead and get this fired up here.

27
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.980
Now the big thing is as you saw we need to get some sort of background image here for when we're working

28
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.760
on the app.

29
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.710
I mean we don't have to.

30
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.130
But I think it just makes it look that much better so you kind of want to go find a nice picture that

31
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.550
you think somehow relates to weather.

32
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.490
So all sorts of different options here really you just got to go until you find the one you like.

33
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.400
This one looks cool to me.

34
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.220
I think it looks really awesome.

35
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.700
That's going to be totally up to you about which one you want to get.

36
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.480
But go ahead download whatever image you'd like.

37
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.890
We got that one coming down and here it is opening up.

38
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.040
So I'm going to go ahead and export this to my desktop and I'm just going to call it background like

39
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.080
that and we'll go ahead and save that.

40
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.640
And one thing I should note here that this is probably going to be a really really big image that we

41
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.080
have on the desktop.

42
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.270
In fact look at this one seven point nine megabytes That's more than we need.

43
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.340
So on a Mac if you want to change how this looks you can go ahead and go to.

44
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:56.640
Let's see here it is tools just size and you can say right now this is an inch as I want this to be

45
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.000
in pixels you know 5000 pixels something more like 500 is probably what we need.

46
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.870
I mean up to you about how you want to handle that but doing something like that.

47
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.440
And if we save that that's going to make things a lot better.

48
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.120
Let's see.

49
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.980
Oh yeah that's 97 kilobytes now can just be a little bit of overkill there.

50
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.500
So now that our project is open let's go to our marble directory here and we're going to Right-Click

51
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:31.780
say reveal in Finder and we want to be able to add in an image there so we're going to go to our desktop.

52
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.510
Copy this we'll go back and inside of drawable go ahead and paste that there.

53
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760
Excellent.

54
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.980
And make sure this gets into our project.

55
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.050
All right click.

56
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:53.520
It's a synchronized selected files and we should see all our background image coming through there.

57
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.790
Let's go ahead and open this up one more time and find her somehow.

58
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.260
And now that's B-24 here.

59
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.960
OK so I paste that into the wrong folder.

60
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.080
So now if you right click and say synchronize get up there goes the background and we can go check that

61
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.610
out.

62
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.430
Excellent.

63
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.010
OK.

64
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.290
So with this let's go ahead and get the style of the app right first.

65
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.890
So go over here to our SML file.

66
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.660
And essentially the first thing that we want to do is we want to have the image view that fills up the

67
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.800
entire screen.

68
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.980
So that's where we're going to operate first.

69
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.470
Let's go ahead and select this text for you and we'll just delete that.

70
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:44.210
And we want to go find ourself an image you bring that out here and we want this to be filled up with

71
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.390
background so it's awesome that it's an option here to get us started.

72
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.480
We'll just go ahead and select that.

73
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.110
Now with this image view we want to make sure that this is filling up the entire screen so we're just

74
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.480
going to add all the constraints here and just make sure that they are all zero.

75
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.660
So I'm going to add zero to that one.

76
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.690
And when we do that that fills up the whole screen.

77
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.770
Now we do want to kind of work here with the scale type there's different options that you can choose

78
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.730
like fit X Y for example there's also fit center.

79
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.420
There's just straight up Center which kind of zooms it in a little bit.

80
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.750
I believe that center crop is usually the best that kind of crops and it make sure that everything's

81
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.120
filled.

82
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.780
So to me this looks pretty good.

83
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.880
But you can totally decide how you want that to look.

84
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:38.330
So with that we want to go ahead and add now a text view on site of here so we can ask the user you

85
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.400
know what the weather is.

86
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.190
So we're going to go ahead and drag one out here and with this new text for you.

87
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.380
Let's go ahead and right click and say we want you to be centered horizontally.

88
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.000
And also we want you to be a certain space from the top will just kind of use what we have for now.

89
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.920
And we've completely lost the text here.

90
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.770
Let's see.

91
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.820
I think it's gone down.

92
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.860
We need we need this to go inside of the image you like or on top of it.

93
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.060
But we need it to reference the top of the screen there so we're going to go ahead and delete what we

94
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.940
had before and let's go ahead and say we want this for the time being just right now we're going to

95
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:27.350
say Center horizontally and also center vertically so you kind of get us at least in the conversation

96
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:34.880
then with this we want to go ahead and add something to the top here and we want this to be at the top

97
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.720
of the screen so there we go.

98
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.640
We've got that connected.

99
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.480
Let's go ahead and change that.

100
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.730
I don't know maybe something like 20 will change that.

101
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.030
Oh let's get rid of the bottom one I think that's going to help us.

102
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.030
There we go.

103
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.590
So now we're in the middle.

104
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.970
Now we have to go ahead and do some work with this.

105
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.850
So the first thing is we've got to fix the text color so that we can actually read it.

106
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:03.890
So here we select our options we want to do background light or something that's white ish and then

107
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.770
text size.

108
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:11.150
Really want to bump this up maybe something like 40 here and the message that we're trying to get across

109
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.320
is we want to say Enter Scott my cap locks on.

110
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.000
Enter a city.

111
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.320
So this is basically telling user hey you know go ahead and pick a city that you want to go see the

112
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.220
weather for.

113
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.260
So the next thing that we need to add here is an added text so here it's called plain text if we just

114
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.400
go ahead drag one of these out.

115
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.430
I'm going to make it a little bit below what we have here.

116
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.930
So with this let's go ahead and connect it up to the top and look at that it grabs next to the text

117
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.940
for you that's great.

118
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.760
Let's make sure that this thing is centered in its parent.

119
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.570
Awesome.

120
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.850
Now we want to go ahead and change the text color on this one so we can actually read what's going on

121
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.980
here so I'll say text color.

122
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.520
Switch it to that nice background light.

123
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.520
Excellent.

124
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.900
So with that we go ahead and switch back to this.

125
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.700
We can go ahead and get rid of that we don't want anything in there for right now.

126
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.980
Then we want to add a button below that so let's go ahead and grab a button.

127
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:24.440
We're going to bring that just right below when we want this guy right click here to be centered and

128
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:31.730
then we also want to have the top constraint there although I don't think that was what we were hoping

129
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.050
for.

130
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.560
You go ahead and do that.

131
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.190
Well let's put the button back.

132
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.190
And so this button the plus button there.

133
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.210
There we go.

134
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:47.930
And right click say center in the parent and then we're going to change this button to say what's the

135
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:48.380
weather.

136
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:56.980
So click here we'll ask what's whether I forget that it automatically capitalized for you there.

137
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.980
So that's good.

138
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.960
And the last thing that we just need is a text view that essentially is going to fill up the rest of

139
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.890
the screen and this is where we can list out the information so we'll go ahead and grab a text view

140
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.040
lay beneath here.

141
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.300
And again I want to have some connection to the top and look that connected right there.

142
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.130
We want one to the bottom.

143
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.710
That wasn't what we were hoping for.

144
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:27.790
Let's see if we can connect that down there to the bottom and we're going to say that you should go

145
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.160
all the way there.

146
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.120
Nice.

147
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:38.650
And then we'll do our left and our right here and we want to go ahead and just say eight on the left

148
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.700
and the right.

149
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.180
And again we want that to actually go to the edge of everything.

150
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:51.290
So if we do this I'm not quite sure why that's going to heads there.

151
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.830
Let's go ahead and try that one time.

152
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.180
No that wasn't what we were looking for.

153
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.970
Try stretching that to the edge.

154
00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.050
There we go.

155
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.140
Finally we've got that to take up the space.

156
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:09.460
So with this one we want to change a couple of things so the big one is we want the text color to be

157
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.390
that nice white color so we'll go ahead and select that.

158
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.830
The other thing that we want is we want it to be bigger.

159
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.830
So let's go and see what 20 looks like.

160
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.990
Now that might be big enough you want to be careful that you don't go too big because if you do do that

161
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:28.630
then you're going to make it so that you can't read what's going on there.

162
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.900
But we don't need any text in there for right now we'll fill that up with information later.

163
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.590
So just kind of empty that.

164
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:35.360
OK.

165
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.700
So here's a really nice starting place for our app.

166
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:44.020
We'll go ahead and get this run in on the simulator so we can just make sure that visually it looks

167
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.970
like what we want but then this gives us the opportunity to move on to our next step.

168
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.530
OK.

169
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.420
And we have got a couple of issues here it's worried about the background.

170
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.390
So the air that we were having has to do with the background image that we have.

171
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:07.180
So if we go to our project here and we right click this background image we just need to change the

172
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.180
name of this.

173
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:14.120
So if we go to refactor and then rename we can change this to background pic.

174
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.770
I recommend just doing all lower case letters something like background pic and then hit refactor.

175
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.490
So that should work probably automatically for you because I've done this before.

176
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.500
I have to go down and hit do Refractories kind of confirm that that's what I want.

177
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:36.790
But anyways that will get that for you so we'll close that out and open and run this app OK and we'll

178
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.720
make sure that the design and everything is looking great here.

179
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.820
So looks like that finish.

180
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.780
Let's see it here.

181
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.470
Boom.

182
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.680
Yeah that's looking really good if we type out some stuff.

183
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.970
Get that nice white text that's looking really good.

184
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.130
OK.

185
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.500
So the next step for us is we just got to make it so that when we hit that button we can actually go

186
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.000
get some information and you'll be happy to know that we're not going to rewrite all this code from

187
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.460
scratch we're actually just going to use our code from our last project because that would be a little

188
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.910
bit insane to go keep writing the same code over and over.

189
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:20.690
So let's open up our last project the sun demo here and well we'll just do this in a new window.

190
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.890
We just need to copy this bit and then we'll bring it back.

191
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.380
So we just want to go ahead and take all the code from here and basically bring it into our other project

192
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:35.650
right because this is all the code we needed to both connect with the API download that information

193
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.100
and then process through it.

194
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.140
Right we did all this Jaison on stuff to get there.

195
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.890
So we should just reuse the code that we already have.

196
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.410
So go ahead and just select the code that you need here.

197
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.330
And I come all the way down here we go.

198
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.500
Awesome.

199
00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.800
So copy that and then we need to bring it into our current project.

200
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:08.200
And I'm just going to put it below this on create and we get this nice import screen saying hey we're

201
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.510
going to import all this stuff and say OK now it's good.

202
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.310
Then we also need to go grab one more bit with this and that's you know when we create the download

203
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.990
task and we execute for that specific you're also let me go ahead and copy all this.

204
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:28.330
I can't get to the end of that long string there so I'm just going to copy all this.

205
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.420
I'll have to delete that curly bracket.

206
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:37.580
But once I have this come through for the time bein I'll just go ahead and paste this in the concreate

207
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.260
and then we should have all the code that we need in order to make this happen.

208
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:49.170
Now we want to make it so that when we hit this button that we can go get this code from the API so

209
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:57.110
let's set a name for the unclick maybe let's just go ahead and call this whether or no.

210
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.760
Let's go ahead let's call this get weather.

211
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.150
So we'll say get weather.

212
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.040
All right then with this we'll come back.

213
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.640
We'll have to write the appropriate function here.

214
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.550
Function method.

215
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:18.780
So public voyde get weather and we'll go ahead and do our curly brackets and we just want to take this

216
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.670
code from here and see if I can't scroll through and get all of this.

217
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:30.510
So we'll cut this or another I guess copy and paste so I have to delete this since I didn't cut and

218
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.500
there now it will go get that code.

219
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.980
When the button is pressed.

220
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.740
OK.

221
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.560
So we've got that in our Get whether things are looking pretty good.

222
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.770
We want to test and make sure that all this code is working right.

223
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:49.950
That it comes down and it's logging out some information here on this on post execute.

224
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:57.550
So with this let's go ahead and give this a run on the emulator and we'll see where it takes us.

225
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:06.440
See an app opens up we're hoping there we go.

226
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:14.270
OK so once we're here I'll go ahead and hit this button and oh that's not we we're expecting Let's go

227
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.740
see what we got.

228
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.570
Let's see.

229
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:19.840
OK.

230
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:27.080
So with our get weather function we forgot to pass in the view parameter.

231
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.000
So that's where it's safe and I can't find that things we need to say capital view hit enter on that

232
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.100
is our view parameter.

233
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.330
One other thing that we need to fix that.

234
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.910
It didn't show us but I know it is going to be an issue we didn't ask for Internet permission so let's

235
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.670
go on our Android manifest.

236
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:48.500
We're going to ask for users permission for the Internet and Android studio just knows that that's what

237
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:48.880
we want.

238
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.280
It's always at the top of the list there.

239
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.190
But we'll go ahead and hit run there.

240
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:59.720
So fixing both of those things we shouldn't run into any issues now.

241
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.400
But I guess we'll see what comes up now in the logs.

242
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:15.060
Thanks Joe it's like we're coming up here in the emulator let's hit the button and when we click that

243
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.690
look at that we get the drizzle light intensity drizzle good this mean our code is actually working

244
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.530
and we can go get the weather.

245
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:30.250
So the next step for us is that we want to make it so that we could enter some city like shaking high

246
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.810
for example.

247
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:37.270
And when we hit this button I'll actually go get the weather for Shanghai rather than just for London.

248
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:43.330
So the way to do this is first we have to get the information from this edit text so let's go back to

249
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:51.310
our visual side of stuff here and we'll select this text we've got to give it a proper name and we could

250
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:56.420
probably just leave it at that text because it's going to be the one and only in the project but we'll

251
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:02.080
go ahead and define it up here say edit texts has a name at it.

252
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:08.110
Text you know pretty straightforward and then or on Create this is where we'll say edit Texes equal

253
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:15.200
to find view by id capital our ID on that text.

254
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.290
Awesome.

255
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:23.080
So now that we have access to that that means that we can then go through and actually grab the piece

256
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.730
of information from there.

257
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:30.850
So here inside of our code before we do the download task and everything we're first going to get access

258
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:38.890
to that edit text all say edit text and then to get to it's information we're going to say Dot get text

259
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:45.040
and that gives us this thing called an editor editable and to get to the actual string we're gonna have

260
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.980
to say to string in order to grab that.

261
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:52.840
So basically what we want to do is take whatever string comes from the edit text and actually put it

262
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.610
right here on the your L instead of saying London UK.

263
00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.060
So we'll go ahead and cut this.

264
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.420
And then where it says London U.K. And you can see there's like an app or stamp after that we're going

265
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:04.810
to delete.

266
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:11.950
London UK will do a double quote double quote so we can separate the two here and then we'll say.

267
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:19.360
Plus we're going to put in that string and then plus and we'll put in that piece so basically we're

268
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.570
saying all right do this part of the you are ill.

269
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.050
We're going to add in whatever the user has entered and then we're going to keep this app I.D. thing.

270
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.010
This helps so that we don't have to go get an API.

271
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.970
I think this is just the sample one that they provide.

272
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:40.480
And speaking of samples we've got to get rid of the samples open weather map in order for this to work.

273
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.540
So it just should be open whether mapped out or and if you do run into any issues with this now coming

274
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.400
through you might just have to go get an API.

275
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:54.940
But I think whatever you had clicked on from the documentation that had some sort of idea might not

276
00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.160
be the exact same as this one is very likely it's different so I would get that from the web site but

277
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.920
this should work for us.

278
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.960
So let's go ahead and give this a try.

279
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.140
So hit run here

280
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:16.440
and yeah basically the idea is that we'll type in a city name and it should go get it for us and the

281
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.810
thing that's you know when we have all this try catch stuff.

282
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:26.530
This is really important is we're letting the user directly influence what's going to go inside of this

283
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:32.670
or else so if they just put all sorts of crazy stuff in here you know it would just crash everything.

284
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.520
So that's where the try catch is really important to handle that information.

285
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.280
So let's go ahead and try Shanghai.

286
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:48.960
Let's get our log cat friend up and run in here and say what's the weather and look at that.

287
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.670
It came through.

288
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:56.910
It's got all the information here and it's got a couple of things so it's got rain and it's got mist

289
00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.760
so I said all these things I guess it's really only got two and it's printing those things out.

290
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:06.120
But you know that was cool because it was different from remember when we did the London weather it

291
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.830
only showed one thing so that means we're definitely connecting with something else and if we wanted

292
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.340
to try just for fun here let's go ahead and put.

293
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.900
Just go ahead and type in London and we'll say what's the weather.

294
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.190
Let's scroll down here and look at that just clouds.

295
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.610
Overclass over cast clouds.

296
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.640
And this is great.

297
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.560
We're at a great point in our app.

298
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.360
So rather than just have our information show here inside of log cat.

299
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.030
We should actually have it show up in that text view that we had created.

300
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:42.100
So let's go back to our activity main and let's get the ID for you here and rather than text you to

301
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.340
let's give it a more proper name like result.

302
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.840
Textfield I think that's probably a good name for that.

303
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:56.640
So we'll go ahead and go back here we first have to define that so we're going to say text view result

304
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.530
text view case.

305
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.270
We'll go ahead and define that.

306
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.770
And then here on our create is where we want to finally set this up so.

307
00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:11.590
So I'll text you as we could to find view by ID or not ID.

308
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.600
The result

309
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.170
is not auto completing.

310
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.540
For me there.

311
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.310
Result.

312
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:24.590
Text view and yet you are not ID.

313
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:36.650
You don't should be result textfield Let's see what happens to you that go ahead and try and run the

314
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.010
app

315
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:45.220
maybe Android Stew's is freaking out on me although usually it's pretty good about it only you know

316
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.930
if it's showing red that something really is wrong.

317
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.370
Let's see now.

318
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:58.300
Looks like you just need a little push forward there in order to run it.

319
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:06.810
So with that let's go ahead and we are going to make sure that we can now fill in the proper information

320
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.420
when someone has you know click the button.

321
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.990
They want that information that will show the right thing.

322
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.520
So let me go ahead and move this down.

323
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:22.210
And so here inside of this on post execute remember we had talked about this would be inappropriate

324
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.550
place to actually update UI information here inside of the background.

325
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.450
Not really but here that we could do that.

326
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:34.830
So what we're going to do here is the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to make a new

327
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.230
string called message.

328
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.960
So when you make a string called message set that equal to an empty string.

329
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:49.410
And ultimately what we want to do with this message string is after this for loop here we first want

330
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:58.880
to check and see if the message is not equals to an empty string.

331
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.060
Well I guess we want to do the opposite of that so go ahead and put an exclamation in front of that

332
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.710
song say as long as it's not equal to an empty string.

333
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:12.700
Then we want to take our result text few and say set text.

334
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.660
And this is where we'll pass in the message.

335
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:15.910
OK.

336
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:21.660
So it's basically saying do that and then in this for loop this is where we want to fill in the message

337
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.310
string with you know the main in the description.

338
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:32.040
So the way that we can handle this is we can go about and create two new strings.

339
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.310
One of them's gonna have a string called Main.

340
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.990
And we're also going to have a string named description.

341
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:45.470
KING And it's just going to handle the two pieces that we had before so the first one for the main.

342
00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:52.380
Well just go ahead and copy this piece of code and say Main is equal to this and we'll have description

343
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:59.340
equal to this or basically saying go grab that Jaison information put it inside of these strings we'll

344
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.960
get rid of our logs we don't really want to log it we want to show it to the user.

345
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:09.810
And once we have these two we'll go ahead and do a if statement just make sure that we have information

346
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.240
inside of here.

347
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:18.960
So will say mean dot equals and we'll just make sure it's not equal to this we'll go ahead and do an

348
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:25.740
exclamation point there and we'll say that we also want to make sure that we have information so we'll

349
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.240
do our Ampere's stamp to confirm that this is the case as well.

350
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:39.290
I'll say exclamation point description dot equals and we'll go ahead and put an empty string and then

351
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:45.390
allow us then to say OK as long as these things are not empty then we can go and say all right message

352
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:54.800
you are plus equals whatever is inside of main plus a colon space.

353
00:24:54.870 --> 00:25:03.130
I got to put this in quotes Colon's space and then we're going to add the description.

354
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:09.890
OK so now that we got that in place moment of truth here let's go ahead and test this out on our app.

355
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.750
We still get this red squiggly.

356
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.380
I hope that's just Android studio being weird again.

357
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.320
You can see that up there.

358
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.400
And let's see.

359
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.960
This time I forgot a semi-colon so that was a real issue.

360
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:29.180
Hopefully that's the end of Android studio acting up for now.

361
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.530
So let's go ahead and test this woo.

362
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.180
I'm excited.

363
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.250
This should be cool to see if this works so let's try first London.

364
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.130
It was our first example.

365
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:39.920
What's the weather.

366
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.700
Light rain.

367
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.090
OK let's see what it's like in Paris.

368
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.250
Clear sky.

369
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.940
Let's see what it's like in Tokyo.

370
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.120
Broken clouds.

371
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.820
And let's see what it's like in the Shanghai.

372
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.090
We've got moderate rain.

373
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.780
And we also have missed.

374
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.540
Now you'll notice we had two things in this situation with Shanghai but they all showed on the same

375
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.090
thing and it just kind of made it hard to read.

376
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:14.770
So something that we do want to add here we also want to add a string at the end here that says backslash

377
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.320
are backslash and and that will create a new line for us.

378
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:25.290
So let's just go ahead run this one more time make sure that this is working exactly like we'd like.

379
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:33.490
So here comes our app Let's try that Shanghai again it seems to be the only city with two pieces of

380
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.360
information and look at that we've got rain and mist showing up.

381
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.440
Excellent.

382
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.220
Now there's one issue that I'd like to talk about and that's that we haven't really seen this when we're

383
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.930
typing out a city name.

384
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.500
We've just been using our keyboard.

385
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:51.910
But when someone's using this on an actual Android device they are going to be a virtual keyboard.

386
00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.450
So if you double click here in the edit text you'll see that pop up.

387
00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:00.970
And you know right now the way that our apps showing up our phone is big enough and there's not enough

388
00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:06.370
text here that this doesn't cover that but sometimes it's the case that does happen at this keyboard

389
00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.330
is covering.

390
00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:12.640
Now the Android users do have the option to just hit this button that's going to get rid of the keyboard

391
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.260
and that's fine.

392
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:18.730
But it's kind of a bad user experience for people when they're using the app if this is covering text

393
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.930
and maybe they don't know about it we should just make it so when someone hits the button that we can

394
00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:26.740
get rid of the keyboard and let me show you how we can do that.

395
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:31.410
So we're going to go to our Get weather function method here.

396
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:37.060
And this is where we're going to write some code to say hey you know what if someone has hit the button

397
00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.700
we're going to go get the weather but we're also going to move down the keyboard.

398
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:46.480
So what we'll do inside of here is we need to get something called an input method manager.

399
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:53.170
So when I say input method manager and we'll just hit enter on that.

400
00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:58.510
So we've got our input method manager that we'll just call manager and we're going to set this equal

401
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:13.820
to get system service and we want capital context dot and we'll do capital input method.

402
00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:20.040
Service can go ahead and semi-colon that.

403
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:28.210
And let's see we've got to go ahead and cast this to say that this is going to be of type input method

404
00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.850
manager.

405
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:30.280
All right.

406
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:36.460
Next thing that we need here is we need to take this manager and we're going to say OK go ahead and

407
00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:46.240
hide the soft input from window and we don't want the one that says method just had input from window

408
00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:53.680
and then we're going to do inside of here is we're going to get to our edit text and say Dot get window

409
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.910
token and we'll go ahead.

410
00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.390
We don't need any flags here so just provide zero there and we'll do a semi-colon.

411
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:09.070
So this should make it so that when we hit that you know find whether a button is automatically going

412
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:13.700
to hide the software keyboard there which is exactly what we're looking for.

413
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.950
OK.

414
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.840
So let's go ahead and try this.

415
00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.180
I'm going to open up software keyboard again.

416
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:27.220
It's not going to cover what we need but just in case and you know people have all different sides of

417
00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.000
Android phones.

418
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.240
But let's go ahead to hit this button and look at that it pops it down.

419
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.880
That's an awesome user experience.

420
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.600
Looks great.

421
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:35.540
OK.

422
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.600
So now that we've got that in place I want to talk about what happens if someone puts in some bad information.

423
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.250
So what if someone types out like your mom and tries to find the weather.

424
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.180
Well because we have all those try catches.

425
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.320
Nothing really happens.

426
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.080
We were able to handle that appropriately.

427
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.140
But the user has no way of knowing that something went wrong.

428
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.120
More than just you know typing in just random jibberish.

429
00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.520
Of course that's not going to do something.

430
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:05.980
But also if we say a city like San Francisco and we say what's the weather.

431
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:06.900
No.

432
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.290
Well it was able to do that.

433
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:13.090
I was going to say sometimes with spaces there's going to be issues with that.

434
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.650
Let's go ahead and try.

435
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.280
Salt Lake City.

436
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.390
What's the weather there.

437
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.070
So it is handling spaces fine.

438
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.820
I do want to show you what I consider to be some more safe code to make sure this happens.

439
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:32.440
But let's deal with the first thing where if someone just types out random gibberish and says What's

440
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:37.600
the weather we should probably alert the user to know that hey something's wrong here we couldn't get

441
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.600
the weather for you.

442
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:43.300
So let's go down to first here in our try catch.

443
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:51.730
For one we're just inside of the you know h l connection trying to get download the appropriate data.

444
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:55.870
All that stuff so what we're going to do inside of here is we're going to make a toast.

445
00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:04.660
So I want to say toast make text and inside of here when I do get application context comma or string

446
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:12.900
that will provide a say could not find whether frowny face.

447
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:19.240
And then after that or say how long I want there to be that I'll say toast.

448
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.130
Well it's too short.

449
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.470
I like to keep things short.

450
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.690
So this is just a little message that we want to show up and we want to show this in a couple of places.

451
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.620
So I'm actually going to copy this and just move down through the code right.

452
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:41.140
So if for example we had gotten an air here where we want to go ahead and do a toast if we were unable

453
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:47.920
to show a message here we'd want to add an else statement and say hey something went wrong go ahead

454
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.100
and pass there.

455
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:54.310
So now we have some code there that will sort of save us if something has gone wrong.

456
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.600
Right.

457
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.410
And we need to let the user know about it.

458
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:03.070
So the one other part that I wanted to show you here that I think just makes our code a little bit safer

459
00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:14.140
is and you can see this with this or else if we go back let's go grab this code for getting the weather

460
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.240
come on Android studio.

461
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.400
Let me kids at the end of this thing I'll copy that.

462
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.250
I'll paste this in and rather than the two string.

463
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:22.980
Right.

464
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.680
This is where I'm going to put something like

465
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:29.690
London

466
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.850
can so that's showing the appropriate information for London.

467
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:45.390
But you know let's say for example we did a two part name like San Francis and says go I hope I'm all

468
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.370
in that right.

469
00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:54.350
And Francisco Anyways if I go ahead and search that it looks like I've given the wrong name.

470
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.490
In fact let me just do a better named one that I can spell.

471
00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.430
Salt Lake City.

472
00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.460
There we go.

473
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:07.360
You can see we get the appropriate information but that's because Safari here is automatically said

474
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.790
hey wherever there's a space we're going to do a percent 20.

475
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:14.340
And in your l terms of percent 20 is the same thing as a space.

476
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:20.440
And so it seems like our code is automatically handling that because we put in Salt Lake City and we're

477
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.790
getting the appropriate information.

478
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:29.020
But just to be safe if you ever seen that that's not happening this is how you can turn spaces into

479
00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.660
like that percent 20 for example.

480
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:40.900
So what you can do is make a new string and we're going to call this uncoated city name and we're going

481
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:51.140
to set this equal to your cell encoder dot in code and we're going to go ahead and pass it first.

482
00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.110
This you know edit texts get text to string blah blah all that stuff.

483
00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:01.730
So go ahead and pass that there and then we're going to say how it is that we want this encoded so excite

484
00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.110
capital UTF Dash 8.

485
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:10.420
And this says you should encode this in the appropriate way so that we can go ahead and convert this

486
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.370
to how we need.

487
00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:17.680
So we are getting an error here because this is looking for a try catch to do all of this because it's

488
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.020
saying hey this could be risky by the way this encoded city name this is what we want to paste right

489
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:23.560
there.

490
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:30.420
So let's go ahead and do a try curly brackets and all doing anyone there.

491
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:38.530
Go ahead and catch all the exceptions and if there is an exception of course want to print that out.

492
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.960
But then also we want to do what we've been doing.

493
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.900
We want to print out a little toast here to say hey you know something went wrong we weren't able to

494
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:49.810
get the weather.

495
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:50.630
All right.

496
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.470
So let's go ahead now that we've got that information.

497
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:58.250
Let's run the sap and make sure it's exactly what we're hoping for.

498
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.560
So what's your theory.

499
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.780
I'm actually very impressed that it was able to handle this.

500
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:10.620
My guess is that this automatic encoding is probably happening right here when we say you know turn

501
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:15.240
this string your cell into an actual Yoro object.

502
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.450
But again this is maybe a little bit safer way to handle that.

503
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.740
So let's try again something like Salt Lake City.

504
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:25.500
Hit enter there and look at that.

505
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.580
That works.

506
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:34.970
Let's try entering random jibberish one time say what's the weather and we're not getting back

507
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.880
any text that says that we were not able to get the weather.

508
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.940
So let's go ahead and see what's going on there.

509
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.610
So I was looking at the logs and we were getting proper Jaison exceptions but the toasters weren't showing

510
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.480
up and I thought that's cause I didn't say Dot show at the end.

511
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.590
I always forget to do that with the toes.

512
00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:01.600
I'm going to go ahead and copy this little blurb for all of our toes messages.

513
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.210
Boom there's another one and I think we just have one last left.

514
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.120
Yes let's put that up there.

515
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:12.990
And now let's run the app and we will try passing it some good old jibberish because we want to see

516
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.440
that stink and TOSed message pop up.

517
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.630
So here this will be a fun one.

518
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.340
What if we don't put anything inside of here and say what's the weather like that.

519
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.630
Could not find whether I do jibberish.

520
00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:26.980
What's the weather can do it.

521
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.610
But I'd try something like Tokyo bam broken clouds and let's try and Francisco.

522
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.990
What's the weather for that.

523
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.500
Ooh we got three things from San Francisco that's pretty cool.

524
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.330
OK.

525
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.530
So hopefully you enjoyed creating this app at least visually.

526
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.540
I love the look of this on that cool image in the background and having the white text and stuff.

527
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.960
I thought that looked really nice.

528
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:59.390
And you know I just loved how simple this was yet because we're using someone else's API.

529
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:04.590
It's insane that we can get the weather for anywhere in the entire world and all we did was he showed

530
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:08.600
you know if there's going to be rain or sunshine drizzle whatever it is.

531
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.930
Right.

532
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.340
But we could have grabbed the temperature.

533
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.270
I'm sure there's other API that we can get forecast from on that open weather like.

534
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.780
All sorts of stuff.

535
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.350
So really fun lecture here I've got one more lecture just to sort of wrap everything up and then we

536
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.760
are done with this section.
