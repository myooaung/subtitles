00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.290
That let's just go ahead and dive into things the first thing that we're going to be talking about is

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.040
variables.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.460
So variables in college are very straightforward it's much much simpler than Java to create a variable

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.120
you just type var spacing give your variable a name.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
So I'm going to say age and you just said it equal to whatever you want whether that's going to be an

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.720
end to string.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.470
In this case I think it should be in it but that's it.

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.790
There's no semi-colon nothing else.

9
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.180
You got to do.

10
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.170
You don't have to say new or anything like that.

11
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.790
This is all you have to do to create a variable and if you want to update this over time say age is

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.060
now equal to 30.

13
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.280
That's totally fine as well.

14
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.840
So when you say var age this is a mutable variable if you want to make an immutable variable change

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.640
from var to vowel and then all of a sudden you'll see you again they're here because the saying Hey

16
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.730
Val cannot be reassigned meaning that once you said it the first time it is that for the rest of time.

17
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.840
All right.

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.680
So you've already seen with cotland if you're going to create a new variable or a vowel all you've got

19
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.180
to do is just set it equal to that type and then Tolland already knows.

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.060
OK.

21
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.020
Age for example is a int variable and if I try and you know set age equal to a string like this Hello

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.870
it's going to say no you can't do that.

23
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.530
And so something that's pretty special is that you know we don't have to explicitly say that age was

24
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.810
going to be an int variable column which just smart enough to infer saying hey if you passed an intern

25
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.070
there will is probably going to be an IT variable.

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.300
Now if you want to be explicit you can so after you say var aid you can do a colon and say capital int

27
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.440
to specify hey this thing should be in it.

28
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.900
So if I try and you know assign a string inside of here that's a no go.

29
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.540
But as long as an event you know it's going to work.

30
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.020
Now Same thing goes for strings if I want to say you know I'm going to make a variable called fav candy.

31
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.680
It's going to be equal to my favorite candy bar and I love Snickers.

32
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.230
All I've got to do is just set it like this so strings in Kollin is just the double quotes right like

33
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.340
this if you want to specify the type you can by saying capital string right there.

34
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.460
Also if you're wondering about whether this colon needs to be right next to the name or the space it

35
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.540
doesn't really matter.

36
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.000
I think typically you've seen more of this style that it's right after and then a space showing the

37
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.300
type.

38
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.810
But again probably not the biggest deal in the world.

39
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.860
So the last thing that I just want to cover here before we move on is with strings you can do some awesome

40
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.540
string interpellation in cotland that's so much easier than you could in Java.

41
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.530
So for example let's say I want to write a sentence about my age and my Candido I might say something

42
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:49.350
like I am 28 years old and I love Snicker's.

43
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.020
Right but you know rather than just always saying 28 in Snicker's I want to replace that with the value

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.000
that's inside of these variables Well string interpellation in cotland Catlin's very simple.

45
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.310
All you do is do a dollar sign and then you just provide the variable that you want there.

46
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.710
So in this case age just like that.

47
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.010
And if I want to get rid of Snicker's for example and do whatever inside is inside a fav candy I can

48
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.780
do my dollar sign and then just say fav candy and that's it.

49
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.620
So go ahead and make sure that this is what we were hoping for.

50
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.810
Let's go ahead and do a print line of this and we'll go ahead and run our code here.

51
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.090
So you should see I am 0 years old and I love snicker I guess I should have put an s on that but this

52
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.180
will prove that the code that we wrote here is totally valid.

53
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.980
OK.

54
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.040
So my first challenge to you which is a very very simple challenge and I guess maybe I should have covered

55
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.570
this to print stuff in cotland you just say print line you can also do just a straight up print like

56
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.660
this but obviously you don't get the return line with that so I'm a big fan of print line but my challenge

57
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.350
for you is very simple.

58
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.440
I want you to do is to create a new variable called name and set it equal to your name.

59
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.240
OK.

60
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.340
So like I said Pretty simple example but I just want to kind of get you in the flow of how I'm going

61
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.200
to be doing these challenges for you so go ahead.

62
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.090
Hit pause on the video now and go do that.

63
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.880
OK so hopefully that went well for you.

64
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.220
Like I said amazingly simple challenge that I had for you.

65
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.290
All you had to do is create a variable named a name instead of equal to your name.

66
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.100
And boom there it is.

67
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.200
I just finished that game.

68
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.010
So there it is we already completed what was two lectures before in the column for beginners.

69
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.470
We're going to keep moving on and talk about math and comments in the next one.
