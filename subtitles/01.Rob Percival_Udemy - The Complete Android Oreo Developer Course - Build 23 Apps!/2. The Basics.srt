00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,930
Hello and welcome to the section on Bluetooth we're going to go ahead and walk you through how to create

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,910
a Bluetooth app in Android.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,870
Now let me go ahead and give a little bit of background about Bluetooth what it is how you can use it

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:19,430
Bluetooth allows you to make a quick connection between two devices that it's typically thought to be

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,020
a short range communication.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,540
So sometimes Bluetooth communication can only go a couple of feet and sometimes it can go hundreds of

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,090
feet it really depends on what type of devices you're using and what version of Bluetooth it is that

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,820
you're working with.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,350
But we'll typically see Bluetooth used for things like audio for example.

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,400
So if you've been in a car that has Bluetooth technology and you can stream Bluetooth music via Bluetooth

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,790
from your phone to the car's audio system and then it you know will play there.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,820
We see that with bluetooth headphones and that definitely seems to be the way that things are moving

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,830
forward more and more as phone companies seem to be getting rid of that headphone jack because they

14
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,730
just say you know what.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,290
Maybe the whole thing should be wireless.

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,880
We don't have room for a headphone jack.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,230
And that's kind of the trend that we see there and also you see it in health products.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,570
So whether it's Android Wear the Apple Watch a pebble I'm trying to think of some of the other fitness

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,540
smart watches out there but things that can track your heart rate GPS GPS whatever it is.

20
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,830
Those are commonly communicated back to your phone through Bluetooth.

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,290
My favorite one in my house is I have a Bluetooth scale so I can weigh myself and automatically the

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:33,260
scale will talk with my phone and upload how much I've waited what points and times and I can log in

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,320
my phone and say Oh look I can see over the past year how my weight has gone up and down.

24
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,640
So kind of cool thing there but if you'd like to know more about Bluetooth just a wealth of knowledge.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,780
This is the Bluetooth dotcom Web site.

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,160
So I have a thing here about developing with Bluetooth.

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,010
Honestly this is the nitty gritty which I really don't recommend.

28
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,090
I think there is a lot better way to work with Bluetooth devices and they have so many specific instances.

29
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:07,090
But companies like Android Apple with their Iowas platform have made it easier for us to work with Bluetooth

30
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,100
so we need to go ahead and take advantage of that.

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,790
So with that large introduction let's go ahead and finally start a new Android studio project and I'm

32
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,260
going call this blue tooth finder.

33
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,110
And I would like to note at the beginning of this is that you're going to need a device a physical Android

34
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,870
device if you want to test Bluetooth functionality.

35
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,780
So for me personally I have a little Android device here that runs on API 22 Sun about this down to

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,020
22 and I'll go ahead and hit next so we can move forward with that.

37
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,350
All right.

38
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,830
So go ahead and start your new project

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,420
and we'll give this a second to load up here.

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,290
And if you don't know how to load an app onto your Android device I'm going to go ahead and walk you

41
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:58,680
through that.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,340
I found this really awesome screen sharing app that is just absolutely phenomenal so simple to get up

43
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,280
and running so I'm excited to share that with you.

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,490
So the basic idea with this app is that we wanted to go and try and find Bluetooth devices near us.

45
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,080
We're going to go ahead and show them inside of a list view.

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,980
And with that list view we're going to have a button below where you can hit that button to search again

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,330
and then it will start looking again and sort of update that list view.

48
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,450
So let's go ahead and work on the visual side of things first.

49
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,530
Go ahead and open up design give ourselves some space to work with.

50
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,680
So let's go ahead and delete that text view.

51
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,510
I'm actually going to start with what we have at the bottom and then add the list view to the top so

52
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,530
we want to have a bottom.

53
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,370
At the very bottom a button at the very bottom excuse me and we'll go ahead and anchor that to the bottom.

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,290
Let's go ahead and center this.

55
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,980
And we want this to be a button.

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,620
So if someone wants to you know go search for some Bluetooth devices so we're going to change the text

57
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,040
of this say search.

58
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,660
All right.

59
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:14,660
Now with this we want to have a text view right above that that says the current state of what's going

60
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,530
on so we're going to go ahead and add a text view and it doesn't need to be too big.

61
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,340
This is going to be kind of just a small indicator for the user about what's going on.

62
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,660
So we're going to connect that below.

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,330
And again right click.

64
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,890
Make sure that this gets centered correctly then with these two things in place.

65
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,080
Now I'm going to go to the list for you.

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,390
Drag that out and have this take up the whole space are going to go ahead and just add the constraints

67
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,380
all around there.

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,480
Now let's make sure everything has a proper ID.

69
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,610
I'm going to just call this list view and I'm going to go ahead and call this view text for you status

70
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:00,300
text view and go ahead and change this button to be the Search button.

71
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,410
OK.

72
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,190
So we've got all of those things in place in the starting text for this.

73
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,560
We actually just want it to be blank.

74
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,280
So I'm actually going to go ahead and just highlight that text and the way that we're going to fill

75
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,450
that up with information later.

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,190
So let's move now to our main activity and I should have done on click method for this button.

77
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,870
So let me go ahead and do that.

78
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:29,580
And for those on click I'll go ahead and just call this search clicked.

79
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:38,700
All right so I'll start there first I'm going to say public void search.

80
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:44,700
Click it or pass a view there make sure you enter to import.

81
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,450
So this is where we want to launch off the blue tooth searching.

82
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,950
And like I said we can't really test this on a Bluetooth device are not going to load that emulator

83
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,910
quite yet.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,800
But let's go ahead and talk about what it is that we need to do next so when someone wants to go search

85
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,850
we need to alert the user that we are doing the search and we probably want to disable that button.

86
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,880
Let's go ahead and make sure we can get access to everything that we need here.

87
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,910
We're going to get access to the list view which will just call list for you.

88
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:23,870
We're going to get access to the text view which we are going to call a status text view and we also

89
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,920
need access have to do the autocomplete there.

90
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,520
And the last thing that we need is the button.

91
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,130
So to make it a button called Search button.

92
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,420
All right so with those things in place we want to go ahead and set those up in the on create.

93
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,760
So I'll start first with a list view or equal define view by IDR.

94
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:57,240
Heidi list view and I'm just going to go ahead and copy and paste this twice down below.

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,110
So this will be for the status.

96
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,560
Spell it correctly status text if you want change this to status text view and then we want this one

97
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,860
to be the search button and we'll have the idea change to search button.

98
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,370
All right.

99
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,660
So all those things are in place and again the first thing that we want to do is when that search button

100
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,360
is clicked on we want to show that you know we are going out and searching.

101
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,040
So the first thing that we should do is we should take our text view which is the status text for you

102
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,850
which should say Dot set text instead of equal to something like searching dot dot dot.

103
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,980
So the user knows that something's going on.

104
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,640
And we also want to disable that button.

105
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:48,140
So we're going to go ahead and say search button is set enabled and we want to set that equal to false

106
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,770
so that the user can't hit the button again and start this whole launch process.

107
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,030
And we want to restrict that from the user for a second.

108
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,330
So with that in place let's go ahead and load this on my Android device.

109
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,570
So there's a couple a multi-step process here and to show you that process I'm going to go ahead and

110
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:14,540
load this new app that I have called vizor that allows you to me to show you my device what's going

111
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,140
on on the screen there.

112
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:22,120
And so I have my device plugged in with us B and it's ready to rock and roll.

113
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,620
Here let's go ahead and go to the home page and I'm now going to hit view so that you can see this if

114
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,480
you'd like to check this out visor.

115
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,100
Pretty neat little apps that you can see what's going on on my screen.

116
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:43,340
So with that there if you're going to be using visor or if you're just going to be using you know this

117
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,960
one to test something on your Android device the first thing that you have to do is you have to enable

118
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,610
your app to work with you have to put it in developer mode.

119
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,610
So what you need to do is go ahead and open your settings app.

120
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,370
And luckily I have mine here recently used.

121
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:07,740
And so we want to go to all the way to the bottom down to about phone if you scroll down to the bottom

122
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,050
where it says Build number.

123
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,310
If you actually go ahead and tap on that seven times it's going to pop up a thing that saying hey you

124
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,970
know do you want to enable developer version and all this stuff.

125
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,960
Because I've already done it.

126
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,650
You'll see I get the text message that says no need you're already a developer.

127
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,320
So with that in place loops and lay out stuff here.

128
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,570
That's so cool how quick it can respond all that but if I want to go ahead and test my app I'm going

129
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,730
to hit run here.

130
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,210
Rather than choosing one of the virtual devices I'm going to choose the connected device.

131
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:48,160
So technically we could have tried out this code with a emulator here because we're not doing any Bluetooth

132
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,150
stuff yet but I thought let's go ahead and just get you know in the flow of working with a physical

133
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,220
Android device.

134
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:05,640
So it's going to take a second here for this to pop up see we got the great will build coming or go

135
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,620
ahead and take this moment to talk to you about what it is that we need to do after this and that's

136
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,990
where that we're going to do something called a Bluetooth adapter and this is going to power everything

137
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:26,230
that we do in Bluetooth so what we want to add to the top here is something called a blue tooth adapter.

138
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,370
And I'm just going to go ahead and call this lower case Bluetooth.

139
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,570
Well let me spell it correctly.

140
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,070
Bluetooth adapter like that so we'll go ahead and talk about how we can get that set up and whatnot

141
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,690
in the next lecture.

142
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,390
But for now it looks like our app is finally opening up here.

143
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,800
So we go ahead and open up visors so you can see this.

144
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:57,420
And here's the phone that pops up and if I hit the search button that it disables the button and it

145
