00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.970
All right in this lecture we're going to dive into learning how to work with maps in our apps.

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.910
And we're going to start with just sort of the basic default want to get you introduced to everything

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.560
as we move forward here.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.850
So let's go ahead and start a new Android studio project.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.210
We're just going to go ahead and call this map fun go ahead and hit next.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.980
Now it's really important that you have at least API 23 set up here you can go higher if you'd like

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.490
to but we've got to at least have API 23.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.100
We'll go ahead and hit next now rather than just doing an empty activity we do want to select a Google

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.310
Maps activity so make sure you have that selected and will go ahead and hit finish.

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.550
So what this is going to do is it's going to set up a new project and get us a map inside of our app

11
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.980
so it's going to lay out for the map all set up it's also going to have a default location there sort

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.660
of pins so that when we open the map we can see what that looks like.

13
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.310
So it's going to kind of get us to a starting point if we wanted to use location stuff inside of our

14
00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.700
app.

15
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.460
Now as part of this we're going to have to go connect and make an API key with Google Maps.

16
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.260
And so you're going to have to have a Google account for that so if you don't have a Google account

17
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.930
you know for like example YouTube Gmail whatever it is you're going to want to go ahead and get one

18
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.730
of those because we're going to need it for app.

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.800
And so as a matter of fact that's the very first file that opens up here it says hey before you can

20
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.230
do this you have to have your Google Maps API key and we need to go ahead and put it here where it says

21
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.660
your key here.

22
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.830
So basically what we've got to do is we've got to copy this link right here.

23
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.300
And come on an android studio is really not great at copying text.

24
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.980
That goes out long.

25
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.710
Or maybe I just have a slow computer.

26
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:58.330
I'm not sure but OK so we'll go ahead and copy that and open up Safari here paste that in.

27
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.300
So like I said you need a Google account so if you don't already have one you need to go ahead and sign

28
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.530
in with that.

29
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.710
But assuming that you do we're going to go ahead and say yes we want to create a new project and I don't

30
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.270
need to know about features and stuff like that.

31
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.820
I do agree to the terms.

32
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.960
So go ahead and create that.

33
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:33.450
Right so this is just taking a second here get all set up and enabling API and I'm glad that we were

34
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.620
able to walk through a little bit before we got here so now you know a little bit more about how that

35
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.670
works.

36
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.600
OK so now we've got this we need to create an API key.

37
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.140
Great.

38
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.100
We'll go ahead and do that and it gives us our API.

39
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:58.080
So we'll go ahead and copy this key and we'll go back to android studio and we're going to paste that

40
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.420
right inside.

41
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.380
All right.

42
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.010
And with that in place let's go ahead and get this running on our emulator to see what that looks like.

43
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.650
Now while we're waiting for that to get all set up and run I would like to show you a little bit about

44
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.390
what you can find in here so for example here inside of our uncreate might give you some space to work

45
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.380
with.

46
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.060
So we have our uncreate here I don't know why that's not going away.

47
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.940
There we go.

48
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.130
So basically what we have up here is we have a property called map.

49
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.130
This is the Google map that we're going to be seen on the screen.

50
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.500
And basically it's these two lines of code here that get the map all set up it's basically saying hey

51
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.960
you know I'm going to go grab this map I want to get it all set up and I want to do an async which basically

52
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.530
means I'm in the background.

53
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.460
I'm going to get this map all centered up ready to go stuff like that.

54
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.520
But you also see some interesting code down here where a marker is added to the apps.

55
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.530
Have you ever seen on the maps on phones before like there's a little red pin or a red dot kind of showing

56
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.480
a point of interest.

57
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.300
Well that's what this is is making a point of interest over Sydney which apparently is at negative 30

58
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.760
for 151 those are latitude longitude coordinates there and it's put some sort of name there to say a

59
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.010
marker in Sydney so that when you scroll over that that's what we have here and so it basically adds

60
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.000
this marker to map right which is our Google map and it moves the camera and the camera and it moves

61
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.110
sort of the zoom of the map to that position there.

62
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.920
OK.

63
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.230
So let's go ahead and see oh this won't run unless you update play services.

64
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.660
Great.

65
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.170
OK.

66
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.320
So I'm going to go ahead and run through the update stuff here but I'll come back once this is all ready

67
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.160
to go.

68
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.540
All right.

69
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.020
So the app finally opened up after I got all that Google Play services stuff there's a little note about

70
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.350
it here in the code that they Google left for us.

71
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.460
But look at this.

72
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.680
I mean we have a fully functional map that we can move around and look there's this little marker in

73
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.520
Australia and that's where the map was centered and if we tap on that it says marker in Sydney.

74
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.810
So notice that this is the same thing that we have from what we had down below here.

75
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:20.520
So for example if I say like I like all see Frye's from out back.

76
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.070
Well go ahead and run this.

77
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.880
And we should see like that you know text now showing up inside of her app.

78
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.370
So let's go ahead and see what this looks like.

79
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.070
It's so up opens up if we tap on that logo that.

80
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.000
I like Aussie fries overall you can see the connection between those two and how it all works up.

81
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.930
So you can really move anywhere you want if you'd like to zoom in you can simulate that by hitting on

82
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.290
the Mac.

83
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.030
The command and the shift key are let's see where.

84
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.530
Yes.

85
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.630
Command and shift key.

86
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.700
If you're on a Windows computer I believe it's control and shift but this allows you to you know effectively

87
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.840
do like a pinch or a zoom on your map here.

88
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.860
So anyways yes this is how you get it.

89
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.710
Now the other thing that I'd like to show you is also how you can just what the layout of this looks

90
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.350
like right like how did we get to this point.

91
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.470
So let's open up our activity underscore maps.

92
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:25.970
SML so you can just see what it is that we're working with and you'll see get this thing called a fragment.

93
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.970
That's a map.

94
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:36.070
And this is you know it's got the idea of maps and when we come back here this is how this is all connected

95
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.450
right.

96
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.720
Our That map when we did that find fragment by ID.

97
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.320
Well we didn't Android studio got it all set up for us but that's kind of how it's all connected so

98
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.160
it can feel a little bit funky looking nose for the first time because it's like whoa all this stuff

99
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.290
just magically happened.

100
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:58.880
But just to recap we got that Google API key here we pasted it in and then we got this to work.

101
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.280
Now one thing to note is that by default that Google Maps API key if we go ahead and look into this

102
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.710
a little bit more.

103
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:13.670
Right now it's restricted to only Android apps and for Android apps that use this particular package

104
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.940
name.

105
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.910
So we actually want to get rid of this and we'll hit save here to update.

106
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.100
I mean if you're going to push something to the you know Google Play store you would definitely want

107
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.020
to lock down your API key so that was only for there but for us we're going to be making a bunch of

108
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.560
different apps.

109
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.080
We'd like to just use the same key for all those so you know we'll keep the restriction saying hey this

110
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.800
should only go for Android apps I guess if we do that then we're going to have to add them so maybe

111
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.720
we'll just say none.

112
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.320
But the point is you know you're going to want to fix that if you're going to go live to the Android

113
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.510
store.

114
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.230
So hopefully that went well for you.

115
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.430
We're going to keep moving forward with maps.
