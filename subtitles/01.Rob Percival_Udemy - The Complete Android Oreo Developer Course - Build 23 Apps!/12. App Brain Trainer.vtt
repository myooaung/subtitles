00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.310
Hello and welcome to the lecture where we're going to be creating the Brain Trainer app so this is going

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.800
to take a lot of the concepts that we've learned the timer and some other things.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.460
Bring them all together we're going even tap into some old stuff like working with the grid layout We're

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.890
also going to be talking about working with random numbers and stuff just lots of good things.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.580
But this is the app that you want to make.

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.050
So it's going to say Brain Trainer it's going to have this nice Go button as soon as you hit this boom

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.390
all sudden you're in this game where you've got a timer up at the top left.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.780
You've got this math problem what's two plus four.

9
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.530
I think that's six.

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.700
You hit that says oh you're correct and it's keeping track of your score.

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.000
If you answer a question wrong it will tell you that you're wrong and say you know you only got one

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.850
out of this and you know so you can just keep trying as many times as you can as long as you've got

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.990
time here.

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.520
And you know it's kind of you know how many questions can you get right in a certain amount of time

15
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.770
and you know if you want to you can keep track of the percentage that you know use or God or whatever.

16
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.260
So once it's finished we want to tell the user that you know game over and they can hit play again here

17
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.530
and then that means that they can start a fresh new game.

18
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.820
So of course this is a challenge for you do as much of this as you can on your own.

19
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.250
A quick tip for you is that when you're working with these buttons it's nice to use something called

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.990
tags so you can go ahead and Google to learn a little bit more about that.

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.960
Or you can say you know what I'm doing this my own way I'm not going to worry about this tag's stuff

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.280
whatever you'd like.

23
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.950
So go ahead create this then come back watch how I do it if you ever need some help.

24
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.120
I'm there for you.

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.910
But let's go ahead and start building this thing.

26
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.660
Hit pause now.

27
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.930
All right let's go ahead and start our new project here.

28
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.450
We're going to go ahead and just call it Brain Trainer.

29
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.980
Excellent.

30
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.860
And we just want the standard for everything here.

31
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.910
So just go ahead and go through that process.

32
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.020
So at the very first place that we want to start with this is that big start button right so someone

33
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.670
can hit go there.

34
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.780
That's going to go ahead and launch everything that you can then start with them.

35
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.580
You know a big part of that is we've got to make that button disappear.

36
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.480
So then we can show the actual math problems and sort of this quiz question stuff that we saw earlier.

37
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.670
So I think visually Let's go ahead and get that side up first and then we'll go ahead and work on the

38
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.110
code in order to make that go away.

39
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.650
So go ahead and go to our activity main SML wait for this to come up Android studio screaming I was

40
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.580
like hey come on.

41
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.090
I just created this thing give me a second to get you know everything up and running here.

42
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.620
OK.

43
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.690
Android studio will give you a second but nothing much more.

44
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.950
All right Android studio finally finished here.

45
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.040
And so first thing I want to do.

46
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.650
Let's get rid of the tech's view that we have and there we go that's gone now we want to bring out a

47
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.110
button and we just want this thing to be in the center of the screen so I'm going to right click and

48
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.710
say you should be cental horizontally and parent also center vertically imperent.

49
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.460
Good.

50
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.950
Now the actual text that should go here I like go with the exclamation point.

51
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.160
That looks good to me.

52
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.880
I want to do a little bit of styling with this.

53
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.250
So there's a couple of things that I want to change and I guess before we get into that right here in

54
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.160
this enclave we should give this a name.

55
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.110
So I'm just going to call this start game.

56
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.000
Once we got that in place then I want to go you know fix some of these text issues here.

57
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.890
So the first one is I want to go fix the font size so let's go ahead and see text size here.

58
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.790
Let's go ahead and bump up.

59
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.070
0 looks like a little bit bigger.

60
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.470
Really want to show that.

61
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.990
You know we're going to get this thing off to a bang.

62
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.280
Excellent.

63
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.420
There we go.

64
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.210
The next thing that we want to do is we want to add some padding to this so you know we want to make

65
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.730
sure that there's just kind of some extra space around here so maybe let's see what it looks like with

66
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.540
20 DP grew out quite a bit.

67
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.810
I mean we could maybe go a little more let's see 40.

68
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.530
Yeah that's that's looking much better.

69
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.720
OK.

70
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.950
The next thing that we want to do is we want to be able to work with the background color so let's go

71
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.360
ahead and move this out in the background tint.

72
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.530
This is where we want to change this so if you go ahead and hit this little ellipses you can choose

73
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.970
some different colors here.

74
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.630
And let's go ahead and see what this green one looks like.

75
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.440
Oh yeah.

76
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.780
That is what we are looking for.

77
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.930
All right.

78
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.000
Hit the switch back here.

79
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.320
Going to give this a proper ID.

80
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.960
I'm going to call this go button and once we've got that in place we can then go ahead and write the

81
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.240
code so that when someone clicks on this they can go and get that thing to disappear.

82
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.200
So what we want to do is create a new function here void and we call this start.

83
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.010
And of course this is going to have a view as a parameter.

84
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.030
We got to make sure with this view that we hit enter there so we get the proper stuff imported and we'll

85
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.650
do our curly brackets and here we're going to use what we learned last time and that's setting the visibility

86
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.450
of the button to be invisible.

87
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.130
Now in order to do that we have to have access to the button.

88
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.640
So we'll come up here as a property of this class will say button and we'll call this our Go button.

89
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.380
OK.

90
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.410
And then inside of our create This is where we'll properly set this up.

91
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:31.280
So we'll say you know go button is equal to find view by id capital our Id go button.

92
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.470
Here we go.

93
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.500
It looks like we didn't hit enter on this to get the proper imports up there.

94
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.350
OK.

95
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.280
Now that we got that we can say Go button dot and we're going to set the visibility.

96
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.020
And with this visibility we wanted to say capital view dot and we'll say in visible.

97
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.070
So let's go ahead and give this a run on the simulator.

98
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.430
Make sure this is good to go.

99
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.390
And then you know we can move forward.

100
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.620
All right so the EP finally loaded here let me go ahead and click on the button and look at that.

101
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.490
It disappears just like we were hoping for so that's the easy part.

102
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.980
Now we got to get into the more difficult stuff.

103
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.660
All right so let's go ahead and work on the visual side of this app a little bit more.

104
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.120
And for one simplicity of not always having to hit the go button and also save us some time and make

105
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.800
it easier to work here.

106
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.390
We're going to go ahead and select this button and we're going to change its visibility to be invisible

107
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.660
so that we can add some more things here.

108
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.030
But then also we don't always have to click this every single time that we open up the out.

109
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:40.640
So we need to add some text fuse for example we need the timer up here we need to have the score up

110
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.160
here and then we also need to have some users trying to figure out there as well.

111
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.730
So let's go ahead and add some text views We'll start first with the top left and let's go ahead and

112
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.350
just add sort of what the defaults are.

113
00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:00.680
There are 16 and 16 and the text that's going to go inside of here it maybe would be something like

114
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.770
you know 30 seconds.

115
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.730
Now that's quite small.

116
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.700
So I think we should go ahead in up the text size here so scroll down.

117
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.640
Let's go to our text size maybe try something like 40.

118
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.490
Yeah that's looking pretty good.

119
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.780
Then let's go ahead and scroll the very top here.

120
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.070
We want to change the padding nebulas just go ahead and put 10 around that and then we want to go ahead

121
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:31.580
and add some background color here so we'll go ahead say that we want a color and for this one.

122
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.650
Let's go ahead and choose.

123
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.190
Maybe something like this.

124
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.990
Light orange K that looks good.

125
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.010
Next thing that we want to add here is another text view.

126
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.530
Let's go ahead and add this one that should go in the top right.

127
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.890
Now this is going to contain the score for the user.

128
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:55.930
So if we don't click on this you know it may be something for initially be something like 0 0.

129
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.390
Then we got to go do all of our classic stuff here.

130
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:07.490
So our size you know we'll set that 240 and we want to go to our padding set that to 10 and let's go

131
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.400
ahead and give this background color.

132
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.980
Wow.

133
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.760
There it is.

134
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:18.060
And for this one you know let's go ahead and choose a different color.

135
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.290
Maybe try it like this light blue.

136
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.000
Nice OK looking good then.

137
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:33.080
Oh and I forgot with this we didn't set the proper constraints on this so let's go ahead and switch

138
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.280
back here.

139
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.610
I'm going to put 16 at the top and we want this to be 16 on the right.

140
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.260
So let's go ahead and use that.

141
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.970
And we are saying why is that thing so squished to the side.

142
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.810
Well it's because we didn't put anything in there that would make sense.

143
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.410
All right.

144
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.860
And then last thing that I want to add here for now is just a sum that's going to show up in the middle

145
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.370
of the screen.

146
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:59.150
So for this one let's go ahead and right click and you know say that this thing should be centered horizontally

147
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.800
within the parent.

148
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:06.700
And then we want it a certain distance from the top so maybe it is just go ahead and choose 16.

149
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.620
For now we can go ahead and play around with this.

150
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.070
But again with this text we want to go ahead and bump it up.

151
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.230
Maybe not as much as some of the others.

152
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.190
Let's see what you know.

153
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.970
Something like 30 DP looks like.

154
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.620
And then let's go ahead and set some padding on this one and since we kept smaller size maybe let's

155
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.940
try like 15 padding to see what that looks like.

156
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.000
Looks good to me.

157
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.360
And really the last thing that we want to check here is just change the text so maybe it would be some

158
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.300
sort of example problem like 31 plus 7 k.

159
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:47.210
So we've got that in place we've got you know the timer the score this let's go ahead and give proper

160
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.160
IDs to all these things here.

161
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.370
So for this one let's go ahead and call it some text view.

162
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.280
You know it's kind of like oh it's just some old text you know some as in you know adding numbers together

163
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:04.210
for our timer here let's appropriately call it timer text view.

164
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.090
And then lastly we want to go ahead and take this one and call it score it text for you.

165
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:14.780
Now there's nothing like you know sacred or absolutely essential of calling the score text viewer timer

166
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.270
or text.

167
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.710
These are just names that I've decided upon.

168
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.160
And you can use completely different ones if you want but I think the more descriptive you are of what

169
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.580
it is that you have here the more that that's going to help.

170
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.800
All right the next thing that we need to do is we need to add all the buttons so that the user can make

171
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.400
an answer.

172
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:31.690
Right.

173
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.970
There's four possible answers there.

174
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.210
And so in order to do that I think we should use a grid layout.

175
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.680
So we want to go over to layouts choose grid layout and we'll just go ahead and drag and drop one of

176
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.160
these here on the screen so we want to now hit the constraints for that.

177
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.030
So we'll maybe do some of the regular ones there.

178
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:56.150
Now with this one this 8 we actually want to go ahead and get rid of that for a second because we want

179
00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.020
this to go all the way down to the bottom here.

180
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.570
There we go.

181
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:10.830
So now let's go ahead and select this at our bottom constraint and we'll do our left up right.

182
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.270
All that good stuff.

183
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.040
Excellent.

184
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.130
OK so we've got our grid lay out in an excellent position.

185
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.210
Now we need to actually go about the business of adding in the buttons.

186
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.930
So let's go ahead and add in one button.

187
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:28.440
And when you're adding this you want to make sure you kind of just go directly into the grid layout

188
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.950
like that.

189
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.350
Not necessarily in there.

190
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.420
And the reason is we've got to set a couple of things about this particular button.

191
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.820
So we're actually going to go over to the text view of this and we're going to scroll down until we

192
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.340
find that particular button.

193
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.160
Here you can see it's the last one and we have a couple of extra things that we want to fill in here.

194
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.410
So as for the text we want it to be some sort of number.

195
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.860
Right because it's supposed to be the answer to something so maybe you will say like 14 or something

196
00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.350
there.

197
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.370
But there's also a lot of other things that we want to add.

198
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:09.720
So the first one being because we are working with the play out we're going to say Android and then

199
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:18.630
we want to do lay out a column and we're going to go ahead and set this equal to zero.

200
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:25.920
Next thing that we want to do is we don't want to say Android we now want to do a lay out row so scroll

201
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.870
down till we find that there we go.

202
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.020
We're going to set that equal to zero as well.

203
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:37.090
The next thing that we want to do is set column width and row with so or excuse me wait.

204
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:46.570
So we're going to do Android lay out call them wait and we'll go ahead and set that equal to 1.

205
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:54.320
And we also want to do this again and we're going to say lay out and we want to get the wrong weight.

206
00:12:54.330 --> 00:13:02.760
There we go we'll set that to 1 all right then one more option we're going to do Android lay out and

207
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.520
we want to set the gravity so we're going to set this equal to fill.

208
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:12.690
I love the auto completes on here just makes it so so much easier to be working with.

209
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:20.010
And then the last thing that we want to set up is the tags so what since we're going to have for buttons

210
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.800
here we want to have tags for each of them.

211
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:28.800
That kind of say you know hey this is the zeroth button the one button the two button three button whatever.

212
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:36.060
So we're going to go here and we're going to say Android tag and we're going to set this equal to zero.

213
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.640
All right.

214
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.800
So this is looking pretty good.

215
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.120
There's a couple of more attributes that we want to set.

216
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.890
So let's go ahead and go back to the design here for a second and we'll just set all of these now over

217
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.430
here.

218
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:53.570
So the first one being we want to you know mess with this text a little bit.

219
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.240
I think it's too small so let's go ahead and edit this text size and let's make this really big.

220
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.280
I'm going to say you know something like 80 might end up being too big.

221
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.870
Well we'll see what happens there.

222
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.950
Also we want to have a good background color for this.

223
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:18.690
Let's go ahead and move up to our background and we will choose a color maybe for this one.

224
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:24.930
I'll choose more Red King and let's see oh the enclave.

225
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:31.120
We've got to say what happens you know when someone wants to tap on one of these and so some cool that

226
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.860
we're going to do is for each of the buttons we're going to put the same on clay which is going to be

227
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.860
choose answer.

228
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:48.880
But then this way regardless of which button gets tapped on one choose answer.

229
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.840
So regardless of which one gets to have this function going to get called and then it's just going to

230
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.160
be a matter of choosing the right tag to see that we got that correct.

231
00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.620
But once we have all of that in place as Button is looking good we just need to essentially duplicate

232
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.290
this.

233
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.220
We're going to go back to our text here.

234
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:11.410
And then what we're going to do is we're going to take our whole button here and just copy and paste

235
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.640
the whole button.

236
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.690
And copy that.

237
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:22.750
And then we're going to paste it three more times so that we have a total of four buttons and if we

238
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:28.060
did this successfully we should see the four buttons showing there but there's a couple of things that

239
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.010
we've got to edit with each.

240
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:35.020
So the first one for this button we're going to call this button zero for its IDs so that we know it

241
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.920
can kind of be unique and it's got a tag of zero right.

242
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:42.160
And we're going to keep the column at zero.

243
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.550
We're going to keep the row at zero for this next button.

244
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:52.000
We're going to have the column B 1 K and we're going to have the ID on this one be one.

245
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.130
We're going to keep the ROE at zero.

246
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.840
But the tag We're also going to update to one so that you can see we get a little bit of a difference

247
00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.450
there.

248
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:00.990
OK.

249
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.570
We're going to come down this is going to be button number two.

250
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.430
So we're going to keep a column at zero.

251
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.880
But this time make the row one.

252
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:13.690
We're also going to update this tag to be two so it connects with the buttons so we so far have button

253
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.980
0 1 2 and then the last one here.

254
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.020
This is going to be our button three.

255
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:19.980
Let's go ahead and up.

256
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:24.090
It's tagged the three in them for both the row and the column.

257
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.370
We're going to set those equal to one.

258
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.170
And there you can see we have the four buttons.

259
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.950
So that's all looking good.

260
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.190
Really the last thing that we just got to change here is the colors for each of those are going to go

261
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.270
ahead and update this.

262
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.180
And you can see we're getting an air here because it's saying hey you know you said that there's going

263
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.690
to be this method handler called choose answer but there isn't one.

264
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:51.130
Well you know give us a second here Android studio we'll get to that.

265
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.930
But we'll select this button.

266
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.530
Let's go ahead and change its color.

267
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.810
Maybe do like purple for this one.

268
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.890
And then with this guy.

269
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:07.560
Let's go ahead and see what colors we've got here.

270
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:17.190
Let's maybe do like a darker blue OK and then this one let's see if we can get something a little bit

271
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:17.540
lighter.

272
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.210
Let's try like a light green.

273
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.140
Yeah.

274
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.990
There we go.

275
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:21.980
OK.

276
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:28.760
So we successfully have the buttons showing up here inside of a grid layout which is great.

277
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.980
We also have buttons with the appropriate colors and everything and we have these kind of cool tag tag

278
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.460
system.

279
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:41.520
It's going to make it just that much easier to work with when we're trying to you know identify hey

280
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.180
you know what button was that they chose for all this.

281
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:52.230
So one last thing we want to fix is with this grid layout we want to change it's lay out height and

282
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.320
we want this to be rap content.

283
00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:00.920
And by doing this it's just going to go to however big you know those buttons happen to be.

284
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:07.800
So when we do this we're gonna have to go ahead and edit our top constraint here to make this a little

285
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.610
bit more saying that hey we need this to go exactly the same.

286
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:18.240
But then for the bottom we're going to go ahead and delete the bottom constraint so that way it's just

287
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.580
kind of up at the top and you know we feel like we need more space here we can always bump this up you

288
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.530
know to be something like 15 but you can totally choose that last thing that we just want to do is we

289
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.800
want to add one last text view.

290
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.930
I know we've been doing a lot of visual stuff here but we're almost done.

291
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:40.170
And with this text feel it's go ahead and have it be certain with the above.

292
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.730
Right now it's connecting to the go button which that's probably fine.

293
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.080
We might want to change that later to be actually connecting there but we'll go ahead and roll what

294
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.950
we have with for now and let's go ahead and change this to say.

295
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.100
Correct.

296
00:18:55.110 --> 00:19:00.050
So this is going to show whether they got the answer correct or incorrect.

297
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.260
So let's go ahead and change some of the attributes for this.

298
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:10.650
The biggest one just being the text size so let's see what maybe something like 50 looks like yeah that's

299
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.670
pretty good.

300
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.770
Let's make sure we get this centered.

301
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:20.850
So go ahead and say Center horizontal and parent looks good and really then the last thing that we just

302
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.190
want to do is go give that a proper ID.

303
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.080
So we'll call this the old text view.

304
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.800
And with that we finally have the visual part of this app ready to go.

305
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.780
In fact if we want to go ahead and just make sure that this is looking like what we thought it was let's

306
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.320
go ahead and give this a run on the emulator.

307
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.720
But outside of that I mean we're just have to kind of programmatically connect everything up now.

308
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.170
So we're at a pretty good place.

309
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:58.700
So here comes the app go ahead and have our simulator here and look at that.

310
00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.590
Yeah.

311
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:05.020
Android does a great job of showing you the preview of what you know your layouts going to look like

312
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.390
when you run on the actual device it's almost always exactly the same which is great.

313
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.770
OK.

314
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.470
So let's go ahead and work on getting things working programmatically.

315
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.010
All right let's go ahead and jump over to our java file here.

316
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.960
We'll go ahead and write the code to make all this magical stuff happen so the first thing that we've

317
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.780
got to do is we've got to make it so that we can determine what numbers we should be adding together.

318
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.060
Right.

319
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.770
What is going to be the problem that we're trying to get the user to solve.

320
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.980
So we need to have two different integers and I think probably the best way to represent these is just

321
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.930
with two integers maybe one called A We could set to some number and one called B that will set equal

322
00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:50.110
to another number but we don't want to always want it to be 5 or 6 for example right like we want it

323
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.090
to be random every single time.

324
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:56.910
So in order to do that we need to introduce some randomness.

325
00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:01.900
So we're going to say random and make sure you hit enter on that to get the import and we'll call our

326
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.310
randomness Rand.

327
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.470
We're going to set this equal to new random.

328
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.420
Excellent.

329
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.610
And now that we have this we can go ahead and take this and say OK a you're going to be equal to Rand

330
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:16.980
dot next.

331
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.440
And you can actually pass in you know how many numbers you want to go through and we want our numbers

332
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:30.010
to be between 0 and 20 so we're going to pass in 21 because we're saying we want you to pick 21 different

333
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:30.480
numbers.

334
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.250
The lowest being zero the highest being 20.

335
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.190
So that's going to kind of be our range.

336
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.210
One do the exact same thing for B.

337
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.620
So we're going to say Rand thought next it and we're going to pass in a bound of 21 there.

338
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.590
OK.

339
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.480
So what this does is it says successfully chooses random numbers for a and for B.

340
00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.740
And so as our next step let's go ahead and display this to the user here to say you know here's a plus

341
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.340
b.

342
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.610
So we need to get access to that text view.

343
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.990
And I guess I should have checked and seeing what the idea of this is some text view.

344
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.100
There we go.

345
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:14.140
So let's go over here inside of our on create we've got a new text view and we'll call this some text

346
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.200
view.

347
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.120
Be equal to fine view.

348
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.630
By Id our ID text you.

349
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.050
Excellent.

350
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:28.920
Now that we have access to the text view we can say some text for you set text.

351
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.370
And we got to do a little bit of conversion to make these events into strings.

352
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:45.250
But let's go ahead and say integer to string it will pass and then we want to add a string where we

353
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.700
have a space the plus button and then another space.

354
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:56.420
Now we're going to add onto this another integer that we shall turn into a string to string.

355
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.100
There we go.

356
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:03.220
And we want to pass and b this time case so we should be able to see that let's go ahead and give this

357
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.390
a quick test.

358
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.470
Make sure it's working.

359
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:11.560
We should see two new random numbers because currently what we have is 31 plus 7 so we definitely shouldn't

360
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.590
see 31 because we're supposed to have numbers between 0 and 20.

361
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.720
And let's check it out.

362
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.310
Look at that 18 plus 18.

363
00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.310
And that's kind of surprising that we got the exact same number.

364
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:30.250
I want to run that one more time just because you know maybe it was just odd that it randomly picked

365
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.020
those same numbers.

366
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.490
Zero plus zero

367
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:41.070
Let's run this one more time is it really possible that it picked the same two numbers two times in

368
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.330
a row.

369
00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.340
I'm starting to think we have an issue with our code.

370
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.550
Yeah six plus six.

371
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:54.460
It's just it's too perfect that it's you know going and grabbing these things so we have a we have in

372
00:23:54.490 --> 00:24:01.030
B we're turning this into a string turning that into a string.

373
00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:05.910
I just don't know why it would be doing this.

374
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.200
I mean I keep getting run like I'm expecting.

375
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.400
Look at that Kate you guys saw this on video.

376
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:19.420
I was checking like the code was right three times in a row A and B were the exact same thing.

377
00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.130
I mean what are the odds of that.

378
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:26.530
I mean if someone knows statistics go run the odds on that I feel like I should go buy a lottery ticket

379
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.440
or something.

380
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.030
Holy cow that was.

381
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.970
That was freaky.

382
00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.410
But anyways.

383
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.660
Ok that's good.

384
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:39.320
We were successfully able to get our two drivers to show up man.

385
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.640
I'm still just kind of freaking out about what just what just happened here.

386
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.400
But OK but we got to keep moving even though crazy things like this happen.

387
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:55.150
And the next thing that we want to do is we want to set what these you know answers should be one of

388
00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.160
them needs to be correct.

389
00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.730
The other ones need to be incorrect but we also want the you know answers to be a little bit random

390
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.600
So we kind of got to work a little bit of magic here.

391
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:09.850
And so I think the best way to handle this is we can make an array that's going to hold all the potential

392
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.340
answers that the user could enter in.

393
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.540
So let's go up here at a new property.

394
00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:22.460
We are going to create an array list and we wanted this to be an array list of integer.

395
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:33.400
Say OK so I guess we should say of integers but you know we've got to in here say just singular in ger.

396
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.360
There we go.

397
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.490
Finally got my spelling right and I'm just going to simply call this answers.

398
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:44.760
And this should be equal to a new array list of integers.

399
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.120
OK and we'll do our semi-colon.

400
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.120
All right.

401
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.150
So we have that array list.

402
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.170
Then what we want to do is we want to be able to fill that full of some information.

403
00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.650
So probably the best way to handle this is to just use a for loop.

404
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:07.940
So we'll go ahead and do one of our classic four loops and inside of here we'll start by saying.

405
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.750
Int II should be equal to zero.

406
00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:21.910
We want to know when it is less than we want this to be for because we want this to run four times and

407
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:28.760
then we want to say each time plus plus K that sued successfully.

408
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.220
Oh I forgot we need the semi-colon there not just the comma.

409
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.600
All right so this should run through four times and each time basically the idea is that we want to

410
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.260
be adding something into the array.

411
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.710
So what we're going to do is we're going to take our answers array.

412
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:53.290
We're going to say Dot add and this is where we would want to add one of the answers so the first thing

413
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:59.140
that you know like I said we have to have four incorrect or three incorrect answers and one correct

414
00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.070
answer.

415
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.600
So in order to kind of go ahead and do this math first we should determine which one of these boxes

416
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.760
is going to be the correct answer.

417
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.400
So let's go ahead and just use our randomness again.

418
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.980
And what we're going to do is create a new int.

419
00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:20.570
We're going to call this location of correct answer.

420
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:21.620
OK.

421
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:26.850
And we are going to set this equal to Rande dot next it.

422
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:35.080
And we're going to pass in the number four because we want to pick between 0 all the way to 3 and that's

423
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.800
saying you know there's four different integers that could possibly be.

424
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:46.000
So now that we have this location of the correct answer before we do this answers and we can go ahead

425
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.420
and check and see hey is I which is you know I'm going to be 0 1 2 or 3 and location of correct answer

426
00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.580
is going to be either 0 1 2 or 3.

427
00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:04.150
So just say hey if y is equal to the location of the correct answer then we know this.

428
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.870
You know when we do our answers not add that we should simply add whatever A plus B is right.

429
00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:14.060
So very simple We'll just say plus B semi-colon.

430
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:14.760
Bam.

431
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.200
It's as easy as that.

432
00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.250
Now the little bit of a tricky part comes from.

433
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:24.060
Well if we're not adding a correct answer then we need to add a incorrect answer.

434
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:31.060
So as far as the incorrect answer goes if we're adding any number between 0 and 20 with another number

435
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:37.370
from 0 to 20 that means we would have some some That's either going to be between 0 and 40.

436
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:45.460
So for that we just want to simply say answers dot add and we want to go ahead and add some random number

437
00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.000
between 0 and 40.

438
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:52.320
So we can in fact just go ahead and copy this code from above where we take a random integer and just

439
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.150
pay set in and change it from 21 to 41.

440
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:05.390
So this could be good but there is one issue with this is for and you saw what my luck is like here.

441
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:11.850
Earlier when I was filming this what happens if you know the sum of and B happened to be like 14 and

442
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.670
one of the random numbers happens to be 14 right.

443
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.650
That's not a good thing.

444
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.240
That's not what we want to do.

445
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:24.120
And so what we need to do is we need to have some sort of check to say hey if the random number that

446
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.700
we created is the same thing as a plus be we need to pick a new random number so there's kind of a cool

447
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.400
way that we can do this with a WHILE loop.

448
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.980
We can go ahead and first create an ant that we're going to call the wrong answer.

449
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:38.920
OK.

450
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:46.530
So we're going to say the wrong answer is equal to this you know random number between 0 and 40.

451
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:55.680
Then with this random number what we're going to do is a while loop that says OK while the wrong answer

452
00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:01.440
is equal to a plus b.

453
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:07.890
All right then we want to get a new wrong answer so we're going to say around.

454
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.540
Answer just exactly the same code as we have here.

455
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:17.430
Go ahead and paste that is basically saying hey go pick a new one because you know what we were choosing

456
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:18.900
doesn't add up.

457
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:24.420
So after all of this this will make sure that we have a unique number that will go ahead and take wrong

458
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.050
answer and add that into the array.

459
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:27.880
OK.

460
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.020
So we at a pretty good spot here.

461
00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:35.640
We have an array of the correct and the wrong answers really the next step for us is we've got to get

462
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.710
these things to show up inside of our buttons.

463
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:46.980
So what we're going to do is we're going to move to the top here and we are going to create all of our

464
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.780
buttons in code.

465
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:57.630
So let's go ahead and make our first button and we'll just call this button zero and this equal to find

466
00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.410
view by ID.

467
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.400
Capital art ID.

468
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.930
And then we want button 0 OK.

469
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:12.360
And then we just need to copy this code for the other three buttons so I'll just copy paste paste paste

470
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:20.520
and we'll change that to button 1 2 and 3 and then we've got to change these ideas to be 1 2 and 3.

471
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.840
So then this gives us each other buttons.

472
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:29.560
So then once we have those we just want to set up what the answers to those buttons are going to be.

473
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:36.980
So we're going to go ahead and start first with Button zero will say button zero dot set text.

474
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:47.760
And then what we want to pass inside of here is the integer to string of whatever we get from answers.

475
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:54.740
And this situation we want to get it done get for the zero position k.

476
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.620
This is for Button zero.

477
00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:05.250
And we're just going to go ahead and pass this and change this up for button 1 2 and 3 and then we're

478
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.550
going to go get an x of 1 2 and 3.

479
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.450
OK.

480
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.490
So this should be everything that we need in order to go get this working.

481
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.410
Let's go ahead and run the app make sure it's exactly what we're hoping for.

482
00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:23.250
So go ahead and hit run here on the emulator.

483
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.950
Take a look at what we get.

484
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.650
So one plus one is two.

485
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:31.940
And then look we get three other answers that are all incorrect but within the range that we want.

486
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.870
OK let's try this again.

487
00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:41.650
We'll hit run and I still can't believe earlier how we were getting the same numbers seven plus 17 that's

488
00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:47.690
going to be 24 I believe and look at that we've got three other answers which are all incorrect.

489
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.780
So we're at a great place but it still got more to do.

490
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.370
All right.

491
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:56.090
Let's go ahead and add the appropriate code so that the user can actually select one of these answers

492
00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:01.020
that we can tell the user Hey either you're right or you're wrong about what it is that you chose.

493
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:06.590
So let's go ahead and go back to this main activity.

494
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.690
SML and let's see I just want to remember what was the name of the function that we chose here for the

495
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.770
unclick and maybe that's up at the top.

496
00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.460
I'm going to go to the simpler view here.

497
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.410
Choose answer.

498
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.310
OK.

499
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:26.100
So we're going to create a new function here.

500
00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:32.280
Public void choose answer.

501
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:39.760
That's going to take in a view just like that and we'll do our curly brackets.

502
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.810
Excellent.

503
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:45.400
Now the first thing that we want to know is what button was it that the user actually chose.

504
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:51.670
So in order to get that we have to access the view and if we actually just type out view dot we can

505
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:56.620
actually do get tag and that's going to show us what the tag is and we can take this thing and turn

506
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.570
it into a string.

507
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.650
So let's just go ahead and log this just to make sure that this is working.

508
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.410
So Lagat.

509
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.260
And we're going to log out the tag.

510
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:16.720
So first say tag colon and we'll do a comma and print that out.

511
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.110
Excellent.

512
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:22.980
And there we go.

513
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.350
All right.

514
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.840
Let's go ahead and run this on the emulator and I'll go ahead and pop open Lague cat so we can see what's

515
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.930
going on there.

516
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.590
OK.

517
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.500
Here we go.

518
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.010
So I tap on this button that tag zero.

519
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:46.900
Tag one dog to tag three so that we are successfully able to figure out what you know button that is

520
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.850
that they are tapping on here which is great.

521
00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.940
But then the question is you know how do we make sure that they were choosing the correct one and all

522
00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:55.930
that good stuff.

523
00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:01.810
So the first thing that we essentially got to do is we got to compare this tag to whatever the correct

524
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:02.800
answer was.

525
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:09.010
And if you remember down here below we have this location of correct answer but we are choosing this

526
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.980
here inside of this function which means we don't have access to it here so we should take the location

527
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:20.770
of correct answering and to copy this and delete the declaration and then we'll go ahead and to find

528
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:25.980
that up here so that we can have access to it in this function.

529
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.190
So all we're going to do is we're going to compare here.

530
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:35.980
So once we get the views tag and we turn that into a string the next thing that we need to do is figure

531
00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.170
out what the correct answer is.

532
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:46.210
And so we turn that into a string so we're going to do integer to string and we're going to use that

533
00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.770
location of correct answer.

534
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.940
OK so we're going to go ahead and compare these two things.

535
00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.500
Now remember when you're comparing strings you want to do a dot equals.

536
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.210
So go ahead and throw that in there.

537
00:35:59.320 --> 00:35:59.830
Excellent.

538
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:09.010
So we want to say if we'll put this in parentheses and just like that do our curly brackets so this

539
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:13.810
is basically checking hey is the location of the correct answer or the same thing as the tag if it is

540
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:18.530
then we know that the user got everything right so we'd want to do a log.

541
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.560
I would say Correct correct.

542
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.530
That's not what we want.

543
00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.230
Come on now

544
00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.090
you've got it.

545
00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.980
And the next thing that we'd want to do is put an else here and say hey you know if this didn't happen

546
00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:44.400
we'd want to go ahead and log a wrong and we'll do something like a sad face or something like that.

547
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.350
OK.

548
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:52.770
So let's go ahead and run this.

549
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.620
And here's the app.

550
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.380
So 18 plus 16 I believe that's 34.

551
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:02.020
And if we tap on that log cat says you got it.

552
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:07.400
But if I tap on 20 it's wrong 25 wrong one wrong.

553
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.300
All these are wrong.

554
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.790
But if we go for this you keep saying you got it.

555
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:12.520
OK.

556
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.820
So good stuff there.

557
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.270
That is all good.

558
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.460
But then think about what is it that we want to have happen next.

559
00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:25.040
Well we want to essentially have a new answer or a new question come through with new answers.

560
00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.660
We want to keep score of everything that's going on here and we want to update this text for you like

561
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.480
there's a couple of things that we want to have happen here so I think the first thing we should do

562
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.940
very simply let's just go ahead and get this text view all fixed out.

563
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:49.170
So we're going to do is we're going to define our text view that I believe we called result text view.

564
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.100
If not that's what I'm going to call it so we're going to call that result text view you know we need

565
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.040
to make sure we set that equal to something here in the create.

566
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:07.670
So we're going to say result text view is equal to our find view by the idea that these old text view

567
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:14.200
beautiful then we can use that to rather than just logging some information here.

568
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:19.360
We can say result text few that said text and we'll say.

569
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.920
Correct.

570
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:29.470
If they got it correct and if they did not get it correct we'll set the text equal to wrong and let's

571
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:35.030
do wrong with a frowny face that'll kind of emphasize ring wrong.

572
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.510
On you can spell Nick.

573
00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:38.220
Awesome.

574
00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:44.450
So we've got that in place the next thing that we should do is focus on the score here we want to be

575
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:45.790
able to keep track of the score.

576
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.910
So let's go ahead and create a new into that we are going to call score.

577
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.300
This will keep track of you know how many things they've gotten right.

578
00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:57.020
We want that initially to be equal to zero.

579
00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.520
So we'll start at zero.

580
00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:05.240
So if someone gets a question correct then we want to take this score and do a plus plus to say hey

581
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:09.020
go ahead and add one onto that if we're going to be doing the score.

582
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:13.110
We also have to keep track of how many questions in total they've been asked.

583
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:20.200
So we need a number in which we're going to call a number of questions.

584
00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.900
And this will set equal to zero for the start as well.

585
00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:30.630
So regardless of whether they get it right or wrong we want to increase the number of questions here.

586
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.040
Right.

587
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.270
So we'll say a number of questions plus plus it looks good.

588
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:42.650
And after this I think the next thing that we've got to do is actually update the score to show what

589
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:43.110
we have.

590
00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:46.680
And so let's go ahead and check what was the idea of that score.

591
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:53.750
Textfield that's a pretty good name that makes sense so we'll go ahead and say we need a new text view

592
00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:04.250
where you're calling score text view us just to find this for now and then on on create method we will

593
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:14.680
say score text view in a set that equal to find view by id our DOT ID school or text view.

594
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.320
Excellent.

595
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:16.160
OK.

596
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:22.480
So now that that's in place we could actually come here and say OK scored tests for you.

597
00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.870
And I'm just going in.

598
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.450
There was a space there that was kind of bothering me.

599
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:32.860
So score text few set text so basically you want to say the number of their score.

600
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.360
Slash the number of questions right.

601
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.860
You've got like zero out of one or 1 out of 1 something like that.

602
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:43.150
So we're going to take integer to string.

603
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:50.840
So we want to take whatever the score is then we're going to add onto this a slash and then add on to

604
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.410
this the number of questions.

605
00:40:53.420 --> 00:41:00.020
But again we've got to convert that to a string string and say Dot to a string and we'll put number

606
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.970
of questions there.

607
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:02.920
OK.

608
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.890
So let's go ahead and see what this looks like.

609
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.350
We'll open up the app

610
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.660
and

611
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.100
crash for some reason let's try that again.

612
00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.770
It really doesn't like what we're doing here.

613
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:29.780
Let me go take a look at these heir's.

614
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.580
So I figured out what the air was and I just want to show you how I sort of arrived at that situation.

615
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:40.640
So down here in the air we can see there's some issue with the text view and it's on our main activity

616
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.850
that Java at line 48.

617
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:49.010
So if we go to line 48 and we can see OK result text view is equal to find view by ID.

618
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.410
Now there's a misspelling here.

619
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:54.830
But you know there's you know we're not exactly sure what the issue was well what happened as I came

620
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:55.800
back here.

621
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:58.490
I accidentally called the whole constraint lay out.

622
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:01.530
Result text view when I meant it to be this text for you.

623
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.780
So I want to go take this constraint lay out.

624
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.220
It doesn't need an ID right now so I'm just going to delete its ID.

625
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:15.110
I'm going to come back to this text for you and I'm going to really call this result text view and with

626
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:19.010
the proper spelling and even misspelled the other one and it was the wrong thing so it was sort of a

627
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.260
double whammy there.

628
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:29.580
So once we have that we want to go back and then change this code to actually be result text view there

629
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:30.760
we go.

630
00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:34.910
And now hopefully when we run this that should get rid of that air for us.

631
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:38.090
So a little bit of debugging there you know.

632
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.970
Happens all the time in programming.

633
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.210
Just you got to know how to find your error.

634
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.230
So let's see 17 but 17 is 34.

635
00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.880
Go ahead and tap that.

636
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.520
Look we get a 1 out of 1 let's say I'd pick the wrong answer look at that.

637
00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:58.250
Now I have 1 2 1 3 and it's telling me wrong but if I do you know the correct answer is switches it

638
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.460
back to correct.

639
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.070
And yeah this is good it's keeping track of our score.

640
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:09.920
We're getting the correct message down here really all that we need to do is we need to reset the whole

641
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:16.970
game to say OK once somebody goes and decides picks an answer we tell them whether they're right and

642
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:23.030
wrong are already doing that we update the score but then we also need to go reset the whole game to

643
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.870
say OK you know we need like a new problem in everything.

644
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:31.400
So as you can probably guess most of this code we need to go move into its own function.

645
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:44.300
So we're going to go ahead and create a new method public void new question and it won't take in anything

646
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.420
there.

647
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:50.960
But basically what we want to do is we want to take a lot of code that we have inside of here so basically

648
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:56.170
everything from random all the way down we're going to go ahead and copy this.

649
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:03.350
Actually cut rather paste inside of new question and then we want to type out the new question call

650
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:07.220
the new question method where we had all that before.

651
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:12.110
So we're going to have a bunch of errors here the big ones are that our buttons are right now created

652
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:17.960
inside of here and defined here where we actually want to do this up at the top so we can use them in

653
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.240
multiple methods so we'll do button zero.

654
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.730
And I'm just going to go ahead and copy and paste this.

655
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:29.420
So there's a total of four and I can update this for each of our buttons.

656
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:34.310
And then inside of here when we are defining our buttons.

657
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.400
There we go.

658
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:39.230
We will not define we'll just set them equal to something.

659
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:44.000
So go ahead and delete all of that good.

660
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.370
So that should get rid of a lot of our errors.

661
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.340
Same thing with the some text view.

662
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.550
So I'm going to go ahead and copy this.

663
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:57.890
Delete the beginning there and then we'll go ahead and paste this up top.

664
00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:01.010
And with that we should see everything better.

665
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.850
So we now have all that code inside of new question.

666
00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:10.820
We do want to make sure that we go ahead and actually call this after we're you know someone has chosen

667
00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.390
an answer.

668
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:15.280
We've updated the number of questions the score all that good stuff.

669
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.280
Then we want to go ahead and call new question.

670
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:23.150
Now there's one last thing that we have to fix and it may not be obvious and that's that in our code

671
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:27.100
right now we have this array list that contains all the answers right.

672
00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:32.690
And whenever this is called we're going to basically just add in four extra answers so we've got to

673
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:38.750
make sure that before we do this for loop where we add everything that we actually clear out everything

674
00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.970
that's inside of that array.

675
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:49.010
So what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and take our ray list which we called answers and

676
00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:54.090
we are going to say clear on this which will essentially wipe out everything there.

677
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.940
So let's go ahead and give this a test.

678
00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.110
As you can see we're getting closer and closer to the finished product here.

679
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:05.000
Once we get this in place it's really going to be that timer that is going to be our central focus.

680
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.780
So let's go ahead and pick a wrong answer.

681
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.910
Like to hear it says wrong we have zero out of one but look at this.

682
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.250
We have a brand new question.

683
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.320
This is our chance at redemption.

684
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.520
So I think the answer to this one is 31.

685
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:19.150
And look at that.

686
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:19.790
I was correct.

687
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:22.260
Now I'm 1 out of tulis choose another wrong answer.

688
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:29.580
Oh now one out of three the wrong answer one out of four letters to a correct one now three 24.

689
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.050
Look I'm on a hot streak.

690
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.070
Twenty nine.

691
00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:37.510
I feel embarrassed doing math on the fly here although it's kind of exciting.

692
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:38.320
I don't know.

693
00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.530
It will be fun to do it against the timer here.

694
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:46.620
But yeah I mean the basic functionality is here we're getting new questions and you know incorrect answers

695
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.540
all that good stuff.

696
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:52.880
But really the next thing that we've got to work on is this timer.

697
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.250
So let's go ahead and write the code for a new timer.

698
00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:02.760
We're going to go to or create method down here and after we've gone ahead and gotten a new question

699
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:09.900
we want to create a new countdown timer certain and a new count down timer.

700
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.080
There we go.

701
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.340
And inside of here this is where we're going to want to put the time.

702
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:21.360
So we want our timer to be 30 seconds long so we want to do 30000 milliseconds Although remember we

703
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.860
have to add that one tenth of a second.

704
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:29.420
So I want to do thirty thousand one hundred there and we want to know every one thousand milliseconds

705
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:35.790
that you know hey we've got to update some code with this and we'll go ahead and do our curly brackets

706
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:36.640
there.

707
00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.590
Now we want to add the new functions for this.

708
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.030
And I forgot we want to do a start at the end of that.

709
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:50.490
And now if we hover over here we can implement our two famous methods.

710
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.620
So the first one that we want to do on the on tick.

711
00:47:52.620 --> 00:48:00.240
Basically the only job of on tick is to update the timer text view so we can actually go ahead and grab

712
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.670
a timer or text you let's make a new text.

713
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:09.820
You hear a story in a text view Taimur text view.

714
00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:19.580
OK then we'll come down on our create and we'll say Taimur text to you equal to find view by ID.

715
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:24.670
Art ID time or textfield.

716
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.070
There we go.

717
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:31.860
So since we have access to this basically what we want to do is display the time remaining which is

718
00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:39.690
inside of this long in milliseconds so basically we need to do all divided by 1000 and then we need

719
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:43.480
to also add on top of this the letter S.

720
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.570
So get ready to tack that on.

721
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:53.400
But we've got to turn all of this into a strength so we're going to say integer to string and we'll

722
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.770
go ahead and put that.

723
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.010
Oh this is a long.

724
00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:03.390
It's not an integer so this is where we're going to have to say string dot value of.

725
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:10.910
And this is where we'll do all divided by 1000 and then we'll go ahead and add that S onto there.

726
00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.100
So this gives us the string that we want but then we have to put this inside of the timer text for you

727
00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:22.540
so we're going to say time or text view that's set text do not tag that text.

728
00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.460
There we go and we'll go ahead and throw that right inside.

729
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.410
So we should see that updating the time as we go along.

730
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:38.550
And then as far as the finish function goes here this is where we'd want to you know sort of tell the

731
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:40.800
user hey we finished up with everything.

732
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:46.860
And so the big thing that we want to do here is we want to update this text view to say hey we are done.

733
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:51.030
So we'll go ahead and get that.

734
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:59.220
That is the result text view and we'll set it's text equal to done just like that.

735
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:05.200
And let's go ahead and run this and see what we get now with our app.

736
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:12.690
So the big thing that we're looking for is that this timer is going to be counting down and see how

737
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:13.800
this goes and look at that.

738
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:18.600
We've got 26 25 right and it's just slowly going down.

739
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.240
This is exactly what we're looking for.

740
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.530
OK.

741
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:26.990
So with this in place there's a couple of things that we've got to worry about now.

742
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:34.260
And the big one is that you know after someone has finished we have to you know have a way for them

743
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.100
to sort of play again.

744
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:42.110
So we want to add a new button to our app so that essentially when this thing goes down to done look

745
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:47.370
at that so cool that we can actually add a button there and you can see that was a long time to wait

746
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:48.850
for the timer to go down.

747
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:53.090
So just while we're testing here I'm just going to make this five seconds.

748
00:50:53.640 --> 00:51:00.910
But again we need to have a button here so let's go ahead and grab a button to put it right below correct.

749
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:08.810
So first let's go ahead and center this guy that's centered horizontally in a certain space from our

750
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.040
correct there.

751
00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.190
We're going to call this

752
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:18.850
play again button can.

753
00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:24.350
And you know the text for this button should just be play again.

754
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:30.690
So double click here will change that to saying play again.

755
00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:41.460
I'm going to play again go in I'm not spelling that correctly saying there's something's wrong with

756
00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:41.920
that.

757
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.160
Again there we go.

758
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:49.590
Great now that we've got this in place we all of us also want to set an on click for this so I'm going

759
00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:57.480
to call that play again and let's go back to our code and add that new method here song I say public

760
00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:04.910
void play again where we go and get a view.

761
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.620
Go ahead and do our little curly brackets there.

762
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:15.510
So when someone taps on this essentially what we want to do is we want to sort of reset the game for

763
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:16.190
everybody.

764
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.850
So there's a couple of things that got to happen here.

765
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:23.700
And I guess the first one is we want this button to be hit initially but then we wanted to be able to

766
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:30.370
show up so we're going to come on it's visibility and we're going to say that it should be invisible.

767
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:38.610
But when the game is finished right when we go on our timer Where's our timer friend and we go on the

768
00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:42.030
unfinished after we say done we want to make that button visible.

769
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:49.460
But first we've got to get access to that button so we're going to say button play again.

770
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:57.810
And inside of her on create is where we'll get that all set up so say play again is equal to a fine

771
00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.510
view by ID.

772
00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:02.990
ID play again.

773
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.370
All right.

774
00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:09.290
Now that we have access to that we want to say OK play again button.

775
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:11.810
And I just call that play again.

776
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:17.370
You know we should call that play again button let's be consistent with our name in here.

777
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:18.740
There we go.

778
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:25.740
All right so now we can take our play again button and we can go ahead and change the visibility's So

779
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.270
we're going to say set visibility.

780
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:32.520
We'll see a capital view not visible just like that.

781
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:37.770
So then all sudden that button is going to be shown which then means if it is shown and then if it is

782
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:40.490
clicked this play again is going to be called.

783
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:44.880
And then this is where we sort of want to reset the game.

784
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:50.760
So the big things that we want to do is we want to set our score equal to zero.

785
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.430
That's a big one.

786
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:58.900
We want to set the number of questions back equal to zero.

787
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.310
We want to set our timer back to square one so there's a couple of things here first for the timer techs

788
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.150
view.

789
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:15.000
We want to set it's text to be back to 30 seconds just like that but then we actually want to recreate

790
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.540
the timer.

791
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:23.040
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to cut this timer code here and we'll actually paste it

792
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:24.780
here.

793
00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:31.240
So this is created and then we'll make it so that when the app opens up for the very first time we'll

794
00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.150
just call play again.

795
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:38.650
So rather than you know here on the uncreate doing this new question of all this stuff we are just going

796
00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:40.560
to call play again now.

797
00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:43.970
The one tricky thing is that play again is asking for a view.

798
00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.640
So we can go ahead and just pass it any sort of view.

799
00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.160
So I might just go ahead and grab.

800
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:55.510
I don't know something like this timer text view and go ahead and pass it there it doesn't really matter

801
00:54:55.510 --> 00:55:01.840
because we don't use it inside of the play again function but we just have to kind of put something

802
00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:05.660
in there so that we can call this function.

803
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:11.650
So we've got the play again and we set the score equal to zero the number of questions equals zero we

804
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:13.390
get that 30 seconds back.

805
00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.560
All that good stuff.

806
00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.750
We do want to do our reset of the questions here.

807
00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:26.560
So even before we get this timer started here we want to call our function what did we call that new

808
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.880
question.

809
00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:32.260
So we're going to go ahead and say new question just like that.

810
00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:37.000
So new question this is going to go through and create the answers right go ahead and update all of

811
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:37.210
that.

812
00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:44.290
There are a few things that aren't happening and that's you know for example we need to reset the score

813
00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:47.740
and whatnot so we can actually just copy this one line of code.

814
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:52.930
OK we'll take this and we'll paste this as well to say hey go update what the new score is.

815
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:55.530
And it should just be zero slashes here.

816
00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.290
I mean if we wanted to we could hard code 0 0 here.

817
00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:03.980
But you know we already updated those things we might as well just go ahead and do that.

818
00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:04.640
OK.

819
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.520
So let's go ahead and run this.

820
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:11.560
I'm sure we're going to have more to do but let's just you know make sure we're at least two to an ok

821
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.010
point.

822
00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:18.730
And you know I'm sure by testing this out We'll see what it is that we need to fix on our.

823
00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:22.820
So here it comes I'll try answering a few questions here.

824
00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:24.850
I didn't get anything right here two out of three.

825
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.100
And look at that our play again button showed up.

826
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.210
So all click on that and look at that we went back.

827
00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:34.130
It started the timer again it reset everything.

828
00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:38.470
But the one thing that we missed is this play again button didn't go away.

829
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:41.380
So that's one thing that we're going to want to fix here.

830
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:46.520
So let's go ahead and take our play again button.

831
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:52.190
We're going to set visibility to capital viewed in visible.

832
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:54.790
So that should get rid of that.

833
00:56:55.110 --> 00:57:01.400
Let's go ahead and try this.

834
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.130
Oh here comes the app.

835
00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:06.320
And you know I'll go ahead and pick some answers here.

836
00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.380
And look I only got one out of six that was too bad.

837
00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:10.120
I'll hit play again.

838
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:16.070
The play again disappears and I'm back to zero score so I can pick a bunch of different things and look

839
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:20.090
at this and let's make sure the question is changing so I've got three plus 11 is the current one I

840
00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:21.220
hit play again.

841
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.990
Look at that.

842
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.500
Updates it updated to eight plus 11 so just slightly off but it did do that.

843
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:32.120
So really the last step for us is we just got to make it so that when we first open up the app there's

844
00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.620
that nice big Go button.

845
00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.760
Everything else is hidden.

846
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:39.310
And then as soon as we hit that you know it starts the game and all that good stuff.

847
00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:45.680
So one way that we could do this is just go take all these things and you know initially set them into

848
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.640
invisible.

849
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.990
And then when it's time to go we set them equal to visible.

850
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:50.260
Right.

851
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:55.310
But that would be a lot of code to do that so one way that we can kind of get around this is we can

852
00:57:55.310 --> 00:58:01.100
add another constraint lay out to our existing constraint lay out and the top constraint will just contain

853
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:06.510
the go button and the other constraint lay out which will then house all these other items.

854
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:09.360
So we kind of show you how we can do this.

855
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.600
Go ahead and add a constraint.

856
00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:19.790
Lay out here and like I said the big thing is that we want to have everything but that go button.

857
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:22.530
So it's like everything else below.

858
00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:26.900
And I'm just going to click and drag and put those inside of the constraint out.

859
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:32.870
So you'll notice it did kind of move things a bit around but the real thing that it moved was remember

860
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:38.620
our result Tech's view when I had it based off of the Go button instead of this.

861
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:43.120
Well we would have had zero issues if I had done it that way but because it was connected there it's

862
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:46.960
having all sorts of problems so we want to take those results for you.

863
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:53.650
Just delete the current constraint that it has Let's go ahead and move it down and you'll see correctly

864
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.710
the play button is coming down with it.

865
00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:00.710
And so we'll go ahead and move it down and we'll hit our little plus here to say hey now you should

866
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:03.600
be connected up with that grid layout.

867
00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:07.070
And once we do that everything's looking excellent.

868
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:16.280
So with that what we want to do is come back to our code here and on our on Create the one thing that

869
00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:22.430
we want to do is make sure our go button is actually visible instead of invisible so we're going to

870
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:29.380
go ahead and take this go button that we have just referenced and we're going to say set visibility.

871
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.500
See Capitol view not visible.

872
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:39.140
That way we can see it and we don't want to do play again Intel the user has actually hit the start

873
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:45.620
button and is ready to go and so we're going to go ahead and move this up to our start where we set

874
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.750
the go button to be invisible and we start this play again stuff.

875
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.260
But then you know we've got to work with now this new constraint lay out.

876
59:54.260 --> 1:00:06.930
Let's give this an I.D. or call this game lay out OK then what we've got to do is reference this game.

877
1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:12.680
So it's a constraint.

878
1:00:13.190 --> 1:00:20.510
Belak correctly constraint lay out a game lay out and then we'll go ahead and set this in the on create

879
1:00:24.020 --> 1:00:34.510
see game lay out is equal to find view by ID or that idea game lay out excellent stuff.

880
1:00:34.510 --> 1:00:43.420
And once we have that in position not only do we want to set the Goes button visibility we want to set

881
1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:46.180
the game lay out visibility

882
1:00:49.060 --> 1:00:52.260
we're going to say view that invisible.

883
1:00:52.330 --> 1:00:56.710
Now you might be wondering well why don't we you know just at the start you know here inside of our

884
1:00:56.710 --> 1:01:02.080
visual stuff set this visibility you know equal to invisible and stuff like that.

885
1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:09.400
And for me it just I'd rather have you know do that code programmatically so I can still come back and

886
1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:13.480
make changes because I really don't care too much about designing that go button it's really more about

887
1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:14.540
these pieces.

888
1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:19.090
So if I had to come back and make some changes it would be nice to have that option there.

889
1:01:19.450 --> 1:01:24.460
And then also with this game layout we want to make sure that it is visible when the game is actually

890
1:01:24.460 --> 1:01:29.410
played so we'll go ahead and switch this to say visible.

891
1:01:30.130 --> 1:01:30.820
Excellent.

892
1:01:31.060 --> 1:01:37.000
And now with all of this in place let's go ahead and make sure on our timer we're doing a full 30 seconds.

893
1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.620
Let's go ahead and give this game a try.

894
1:01:41.620 --> 1:01:44.330
So we'll go ahead and hit run here.

895
1:01:48.210 --> 1:01:49.130
OK.

896
1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:57.750
Here comes the app and look at that it's all nice and why it's fairly like OK are you ready to do this.

897
1:01:57.820 --> 1:01:59.090
And I'm going to do this for real.

898
1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:05.050
Let's see how how fast I can get these answers are going to go ahead and hit go.

899
1:02:05.350 --> 1:02:36.230
Seven seven teen 23:6 25 25 24 13:29 59 21 13:29 22 23 and 12 24 6 to 22 on the Dow.

900
1:02:36.260 --> 1:02:36.840
Look at that.

901
1:02:36.860 --> 1:02:43.390
OK so 23 didn't wasn't able to do one every second and that would be that would be speedy if he can.

902
1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:46.440
But let's go ahead and try you know the play again and look at that.

903
1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:47.890
We're ready to go.

904
1:02:47.890 --> 1:02:53.120
So one thing it looks like I did notice is when we got all the way down to zero it had.

905
1:02:53.240 --> 1:03:00.320
It was still showing the message done rather than showing it kind of like going blank for the very first

906
1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:00.740
time.

907
1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:04.600
So maybe you let's go ahead and have that be part of play again.

908
1:03:04.630 --> 1:03:11.450
That's where we go ahead and take our result text view and we're going to set it's text to be just equal

909
1:03:11.450 --> 1:03:16.200
to an empty string and we'll go ahead and run this one more time.

910
1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:20.940
OK.

911
1:03:20.950 --> 1:03:27.660
App opens up we hit go and look at that we can start making some choices to see how many times I can

912
1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:29.570
click this.

913
1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:30.840
Well probably a lot.

914
1:03:30.990 --> 1:03:36.030
So while we're waiting for that timer to run out just want to say to gratz on finishing the SAT.

915
1:03:36.030 --> 1:03:41.870
This was a fairly lengthy chunky app that we made here but pretty awesome functionally like.

916
1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.680
And we've taken so many concepts that we've learned and just keep rolling them into these apps like

917
1:03:47.100 --> 1:03:51.150
Hopefully you're starting to really comprehend the stuff that we've got and it's really starting to

918
1:03:51.150 --> 1:03:52.880
get cemented in.

919
1:03:53.010 --> 1:03:53.650
And look at that.

920
1:03:53.670 --> 1:03:55.330
Here it comes let's hit that button.

921
1:03:55.380 --> 1:04:01.930
Oh look at that it is an empty string that's beautiful but we can you know still keep playing game.

922
1:04:02.190 --> 1:04:06.150
Next thing that we're going to move on to is learn how to download some web content so that's going

923
1:04:06.150 --> 1:04:07.530
to be pretty fun.

924
1:04:07.590 --> 1:04:08.790
You've been doing great.

925
1:04:08.820 --> 1:04:10.950
Keep up the energy let's keep truckin.
