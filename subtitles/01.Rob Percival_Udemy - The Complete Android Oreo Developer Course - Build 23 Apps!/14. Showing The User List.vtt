WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.700
So the next step for us in this app is we want to make it so that when we hit log in and we have the

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.100
right user name and password combination right now we don't have that that will actually log us in.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.310
And then we can see a list of all the users in the app.

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.750
So if you'd like to do this as a challenge you're just going to show up in a new list view and another

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.620
activity you can go ahead and try that.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.940
Or you can just come along with me so if you want to go do that as a challenge.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.700
Hit pause.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.870
Now but if you're here to come along with me let's go ahead and the first thing that we want to do is

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.250
we want to make a new activity that we can move to.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.210
So let's make a new activity here.

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.790
And with this we just want an empty activity.

12
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.240
And as far as the name goes you can choose whatever you want but I think probably something like user

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.410
list activity describes what should be going on in the of this activity so that will go ahead and create

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.890
the next thing that we need to do is update the visual side of this user list activity.

15
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.280
So we'll give this a second update here.

16
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.640
But basically we're just going to add a list few that's going to take up the entire screen here.

17
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.730
So give Android studio a second here to finish its business.

18
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.880
All right so we finally got that loaded up and again we just want to take a list view and have it fill

19
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.170
up the whole screen so we'll add that here.

20
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.480
And with that it's taking up most of the screen so just go ahead and add some constraints around the

21
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.230
edge and we'll give it an idea of list view so that we can access it inside of our app.

22
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.530
All right.

23
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.590
With that in place let's move over to the user list activity and I guess before we do that maybe we

24
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.010
should write the code to get to this activity first then we can worry about filling up that list view

25
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.890
right because if we wrote the code to see the list view but we can't get to it now we're going to have

26
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.110
a problem.

27
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.980
So the first place that we want to go to is there's a lot of different situations where we want to go

28
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.200
to that activity if they are able to successfully sign up or they're able to successfully log in or

29
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.440
they're just logged in from the get go and so let's make a method that will we can just call whenever

30
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
we want to that will move us to that next activity.

31
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.800
So I'm going to call this public void and show user list.

32
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.220
Nothing special about this name it's just what I've decided to call it.

33
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.970
And in here basically what we want to do is create an intent will call intent.

34
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.390
This will be a new intent.

35
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:39.370
We get the application context and we want to move to the user list activity class.

36
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.640
So that will get us there and then if that gives us the intent if we want to go move there we're going

37
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.310
to have to say start activity and then pass that intent right inside.

38
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.880
So once we have that in place we now have to figure out where it is that we want to call.

39
00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.840
So again this show user list we should do this after the user successfully is able to sign up.

40
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.570
So say show user list there if they're able to successfully log in.

41
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.180
That's the situation when we would want to show the user list.

42
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.240
And there's one more that's you know if they open up the app and they've already been logged in well

43
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.580
then we would want to automatically take them there.

44
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.290
So we're going to add one more piece of code here will do in an IF statement to just see if somebody

45
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.460
has logged in already and if they are we'll just take them there.

46
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.930
So what we're going to do is we're going to go get to our parse user and with our parse user we are

47
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.590
going to do dot get current user.

48
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.270
And we're going to see if this is not equal to know and if it's not equal to no well then that means

49
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.810
that we can go ahead.

50
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.900
Oh not when I want to copy paste.

51
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.440
That means that we'll be able to do the show user list or this.

52
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.170
Go ahead and type that in there.

53
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.890
OK.

54
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.970
So that will get us to the correct location.

55
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.710
And now the next part for us is to actually set up that list view.

56
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.630
So let's move over to our list view activity and just write sort of the generic code that we've done

57
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.180
over and over again to fill up a list view.

58
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.950
So we're going to type out list view and you can go ahead and Khalida everyone I'm just going to call

59
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.520
it lowercase list view.

60
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.010
I'm going to say this is equal to find user id art ID dot list for some kind of blowing through this

61
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.870
because you know we've done this so many times it should almost be second nature for you then we need

62
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.060
to create an array list that's going to be of a bunch of strings that's going to be the name of the

63
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.140
users.

64
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.370
So let's go ahead and call this something like user names.

65
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:42.510
And once we have this we'll say this is equal to a new capital array list and we again we want to specify

66
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.130
that this should be a bunch of strings inside of there after we have that in place.

67
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.450
Let's go ahead and just add something simple in there so to say user names that add in.

68
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.560
We'll just put a test one in there to make sure things are working.

69
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.360
Then after we've done that we have to create an array adapter so make an array adapter that will call

70
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:10.820
array adapter and say this is equal to a new array adapter and we're going to pass in this for the context.

71
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.340
Lowercase Android are not lay out a dot.

72
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.320
There's our simple list item 1 and then will pass in user names which is that array.

73
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.800
So now that we've got that really the last thing is set in the adapter on the list fusel say List View

74
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:38.160
set adapter and we'll pass an array adapter there and with all of this we are ready to move forward

75
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.950
and just test and see if this is even going to work.

76
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.320
So as we're waiting for the emulator to show up here kind of the next steps that we're going to have

77
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.770
to be working for is actually going inquere in part to say hey who are all the users we want to add

78
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.860
those to a particular array list and then have those show up inside of the list view.

79
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.220
So that's going to be sort of our next step to see if we can't get things running there.

80
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.420
And it looks like you know the emulators taken a little bit of time here so maybe let's go start working

81
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.530
on this query in order to make that happen.

82
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:20.360
So I'm going to go down here and we're going to start a new parse query was do capital parse query except

83
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.850
usually put like parse object inside of here.

84
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.830
This time we want to get parsed user so we're going to put that inside of our angle brackets and we'll

85
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.780
just go ahead and call this a queery like we've done before and we'll say this is equal to a new.

86
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.790
In this case parse user dot get queery So that's different from the parse object and it looks like probably

87
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.410
the emulator finished up.

88
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.640
So because we've already logged into the app it automatically took us here.

89
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.660
That means our codes are working and we're in a good place.

90
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.890
So we can kind of check that box off.

91
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.370
The next thing that we need to do is we need to sort of modify this query to handle our situation.

92
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:04.290
So the big one is we want to make sure that we when we get all the user objects that we don't get the

93
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.180
current user that's logged in.

94
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.810
So we're going to factor that into our queries by saying queery where not equal to.

95
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:19.260
And here we're going to say wherever the user name and the next première that we're passing inside of

96
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:25.440
here is the current user's username to say hey we don't want this particular user sorgen say parse user

97
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:34.350
get current user and get username and this will be a good check to see hey if you know there's we're

98
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:40.550
going to get the whole list we shouldn't show our name in that list once we have this in place.

99
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.900
We're also going to modify this query and say that we want it to come in a particular order.

100
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.960
So we're going to say queery that ad and you can do ascending or descending but we're going to do ascending

101
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.060
order and we want all these users to be sorted by their user name.

102
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.110
So this will kind of make things look a little bit nicer things will be alphabetical that's actually

103
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:06.990
one of my biggest gripes of instagram is that when I look at people who are following me or people that

104
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.510
I'm following like that big list of people it's not in alphabetical it doesn't seem to be related to

105
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.970
time just like a random mess that always drives me crazy.

106
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.100
But next step for us is k so we said we don't want ourselves who want to in this particular order.

107
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.120
Now we just have to go ahead and execute the query.

108
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.320
So we're going to say queery dot find in background.

109
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:35.430
And with this we're going to hopefully get back a list of user objects so we're going to create a new

110
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.100
find callback.

111
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.990
And with this you can see it gives us back a list of parse user objects so all these callbacks have

112
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.220
a little bit of different names.

113
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.140
You've got to be ready to find those different ones but you can see we can get a list of these user

114
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.220
objects an exception.

115
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.870
So with this the first thing that we want to check is just see hey do we have any errors with this thing.

116
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.370
So we're going to say hey if B is equal to no.

117
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.660
That means we probably have no errors and we can move forward but are else in that situation is we've

118
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.770
got some sort of air and so we'll just do a print stack trace on that.

119
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.990
But assuming that we have no heirs let's make sure that we have an actual list of objects.

120
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:23.010
So we'll do another if statement here to check the size so we're going to say if objects that size is

121
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.910
greater than zero this will just be one more check to make sure we've got what we think we have.

122
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.710
Then inside we're going to finish up here with a for loop.

123
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.000
So this for loop is going to move through all these objects which are a bunch of users.

124
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:42.720
So we're going to say capital parse user will give us the name of users we loop through.

125
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.180
We wanted to go through all the objects and once we're here we want to extract the user names and put

126
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.790
them inside of our re list of user names.

127
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.470
While I'm looking at this we can probably get rid of our test users so we'll go ahead and delete that

128
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.350
but we'll say all right user names got ADD.

129
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.990
And we simply just want to go ahead and take whatever user We're currently working through in the survey.

130
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:13.560
And we're going to or excuse me list and we want to get your name and simply add that in there.

131
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.180
OK.

132
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.390
Then the only other thing that we want to change about this is you know we've done all the correct stuff

133
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:24.900
to get the list view and you know get an array adapter and stuff but we only want to set the adapter

134
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.560
here after we've gone through this for that.

135
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.380
So we're going to move that line of code down here so that we can have access to it.

136
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:39.870
So with all of this in place let's go ahead and run our app and see if we can't get this to show up.

137
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.320
So we'll go ahead and give this a second here.

138
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:51.780
While it's going I want to show you a cool feature of parce here and that's that you can add new items

139
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.110
to a class over here on the web.

140
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.640
So here I have our users right.

141
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.810
I can hit the plus button to make a new user.

142
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:06.570
We'd have to give it a user name here and I don't know why it's there we go it's up at the top here

143
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:15.530
so maybe I can give it the user name of Sarah and we're going to have to give Sarah a password maybe

144
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:20.360
something like let's stick with our ABC 1 2 3 so we can remember who these are but look at that we've

145
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.800
also added a new user.

146
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:28.040
So let's look at our emulator right now it's only showing Nick because we logged in as John so we know

147
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.440
at least we're getting one user back but now that we've added Sarah we should see Sarah and Nick showing

148
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:33.620
up.

149
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.140
So let's go ahead and run this one more time.

150
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:38.900
Oh.

151
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.320
Trying to get the Android studio here let's run this one more time.

152
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.380
So I hope you enjoyed seeing you.

153
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.210
You can add things manually here.

154
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.140
But with that we should see now.

155
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.440
Nick and Sarah.

156
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:50.840
OK.

157
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.770
So it wasn't all that much code.

158
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.900
Now we have successfully a list of all the users excluding ourselves.

159
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:04.970
And you'll notice the order of things is not exactly perfect with the capitalization of things.

160
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.610
It doesn't take that into account or it does take it into account so like the Capitals work there in

161
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:18.420
fact if we go ahead and make this lower case Sarah and then we go and run this one more time.

162
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.560
You'll notice how that changes so that's a little bit of a frustrating thing.

163
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.530
I think at least that happens with this app.

164
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.760
But let's go ahead and open up and look now it does that so a little bit something to keep in mind as

165
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.480
you're moving forward.

166
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.940
But we're making good progress on this but we haven't even added the ability to upload photos So still

167
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.180
plenty of left to go in this project.
