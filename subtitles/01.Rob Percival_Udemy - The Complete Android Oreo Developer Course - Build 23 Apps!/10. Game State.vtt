00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.690
So in this lecture we want to finish everything off.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.880
There's a lot of things to do here.

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.580
We've got to keep track of the score.

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.980
We've got to restart the game if that happens there's just all sorts of things that we want to do.

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.120
We want to get that dizzie face to show up if Alson coin man runs into something so the first one is

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.800
let's work on the score.

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.470
So let's just go ahead and add a new event up at the top that we'll just call score and we'll set that

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.190
equal to zero gain.

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.040
And the basic idea is that we are going to update this every time.

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.740
Coin man runs into a coin.

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.060
So rather than log something about the coin we're going to say score plus plus.

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.400
So that we are upping that the next thing that we want to do is you might have noticed this but if you

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.430
run into a coin you're going to be overlapping it for a while.

14
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.050
So we actually want to get rid of the coin if we run into it.

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.690
So we're going to have to go to all our coin arrays which we have coin rectangles.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.810
And in this case we'd want to do not remove that position.

17
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:09.210
I would also want to do something for the coin X's remove that position and same thing for coin wise

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.130
remove position.

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
So that kind of removes the coin so it doesn't show up again and then you know we won't collide with

20
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950
it over and over and over again.

21
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.270
And the other thing is we don't want to have the chance to keep going through this for loop.

22
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.780
We just want to completely leave this for loop and so we can actually do that with something called

23
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.200
a break.

24
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.830
It just jumps us out of this for a loop and then comes down and checks this for loop below OK.

25
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.330
So that's the way that we can take the score.

26
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.050
But then the question becomes well how do we get our score to show up.

27
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.930
So let's go ahead and scroll up to the top here.

28
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.510
We are going to add something called a bitmap font.

29
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.520
And so this is going to allow us to display some text on the screen.

30
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.430
We just want to show the score.

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:01.290
And so let's go ahead and type out bit map font and I'll just go ahead and call this font.

32
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.190
Now with this in place inside of our create method this is where we want to then get the bitmap font

33
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.470
all set up and there's a couple of things you want to do.

34
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.940
So the first one is just create this new bitmap font so there's a new bitmap font just like that.

35
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.540
Then once we have that in place we want to set a color on that.

36
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.050
So we're going to say font set color and we are ultimately looking to do a white color.

37
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.680
I think that will show up pretty nice.

38
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.220
Now you can choose whatever color you like.

39
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.160
Then once we have that in place with this font we are going to go ahead and set a certain size for it.

40
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.890
So to do that we're going to say get data datt set the scale and you can play around with what you think

41
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.310
is great.

42
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.980
I think 10 is a good position to be in.

43
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.760
So with that in place now we have to go ahead and actually draw this font on the screen just like we've

44
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.940
drawn the textures and everything else.

45
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.490
So we'll come here at the bottom after we've added any sort of score updates and stuff.

46
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:13.440
And this is where we want to draw the score so we're going to save Fonte dot draw and we're going to

47
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.810
have to put in some information here so the first thing that we got to pass pass and it's a little bit

48
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.320
different than we do the front draw right because usually it's the batched draw.

49
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.950
But in this case is font's thought draw and we pass in the batch then the next thing is we have to say

50
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.300
what string it is that we want to show up.

51
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.270
So we're going to say string value of so that we can turn the score and into a string.

52
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.590
So we'll just put a score there and then we've got to say you know where it is we want the x and y position

53
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.460
of this to be so we're going to say 100 and 200.

54
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.500
This will put it in the bottom left corner of the screen and feel free to play around with that one.

55
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.560
However you'd like to you know get this to work for you.

56
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.400
So we'll go ahead and give this a second to run

57
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.490
emulator here and look at that.

58
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.330
We've got this nice score at the bottom.

59
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.420
And you know as we gather more and more coins boom you know we get that number updating.

60
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.120
Pretty great stuff.

61
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.260
Now the next biggest issue for us is that we're not seeing the game.

62
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.520
And whenever we run into those Bobs.

63
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.510
So we've got to figure out how to fix that.

64
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.440
So what we need to do is when we run into a bomb which we already have the code for that right here

65
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.860
we need to make it so that as soon as that happens we can end the game.

66
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.030
Now in order to end the game we have to introduce a new concept called game state.

67
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.560
So we're going to scroll up to the top and we are going to make a new ENT called the game state and

68
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.330
this is going to represent you know what state the game is and we're going to have a couple of different

69
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.980
options here.

70
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.130
But I'd like to go and have them all sort of list it out.

71
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.760
So let's go down to our render method here.

72
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.880
And I'm just going to do an if statement where I say first if game state is equal to 1.

73
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:11.940
This means we are in sort of the normal game like coin man will say something like a game is live right

74
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.800
like he's jumping in trying to get coins we're counting the score.

75
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.290
All that good stuff.

76
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.120
And then we're going to do an LCF to see if the game state is equal to zero.

77
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:34.930
So in this situation of game state I misspelled game state and we go and I'll have to come back and

78
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.800
fix this be a big deal there you go.

79
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:46.810
Now if game state is equal to zero that's for us is going to represent if you know we're in a starting

80
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.040
position for this game.

81
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.870
And so that's going to be waiting to start.

82
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.760
OK.

83
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:05.190
And then our last else if is going to check and see if game state is equal to 2.

84
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.370
And this is the game over situation.

85
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.300
OK.

86
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.830
So these are different situations that we have here and we've got to you know update the game appropriately

87
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.480
so while we're waiting for the game to start.

88
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.120
If the user taps on the screen that we want to kick it into game state 1 and then if the in game state

89
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.560
1 and they run into a bomb and we want to move it to two and if they're in two and they hit you know

90
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.510
tap the screen again we want to get them back into one sort of this flow that's going to be happening

91
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.980
here.

92
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.930
So let's go ahead and start first with making it so that when we hit a bomb we are going to update that

93
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.810
game state to be too.

94
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.290
So we'll just type out here.

95
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.410
Game state is equal to two.

96
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:55.060
But then we have to actually make some real decisions about what sort of code goes in for game state

97
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.550
one game state 0.

98
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.620
And let me go ahead and talk about first let's get inside of your game state zero.

99
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.650
So this is just waiting you know for the user to start the game.

100
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.710
And so what we're going to do inside of here is look for a touch screen and say hey if they touch the

101
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.070
screen we want to go get the game rolling here.

102
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:22.770
So we'll do our GDX that input just touched.

103
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.140
So tell us whether or not they just touch the screen and if they did very simple move here and just

104
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.130
say game state you're equal to one.

105
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.540
All right.

106
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.230
Only one equal sign on that.

107
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.340
There we go.

108
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.760
Now the next thing that I want to do is for game state one so if the game is live what things should

109
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.230
we have going on that.

110
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.470
Well we definitely want the bomb in the coin situation going on right.

111
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.350
Like we want there to be coins and bombs appearing if the game's over.

112
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.020
We're waiting to start.

113
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:57.220
We don't want those coming across the screen so I'm going to cut those and paste that right inside there.

114
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.850
We've also got some other code here about the velocity of our little do and all this stuff.

115
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.490
And I think we should include all of this so let's go ahead and grab all this with velocity and man

116
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:17.870
why we'll cut this and put this into our top game one game state equal to one situation.

117
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:24.060
Now the rest of this you know we always want to be detecting for coins and bomb situations we always

118
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.860
want to draw out the dude.

119
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.740
So this we can actually just leave here at the bottom this doesn't have to be necessarily any of the

120
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:38.320
game states but then does bring up the question of what happens when the game is over.

121
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.770
And essentially what we want to do here is we just want to reset everything we want to get back to a

122
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.130
starting position.

123
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:52.440
So what we're going to do is just sort of roll through and see OK if they're in this game over state

124
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.930
and they you know suddenly touch the screen.

125
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.090
So for example let's go ahead and just copy paste this.

126
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.170
Yes we want games to be won but there's a whole lot of things that we want to reset.

127
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.920
So the first one is the man y position.

128
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:17.430
So I'm going to scroll up to when we said Man why here just going to copy this code and we'll come and

129
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.300
paste it.

130
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.660
There we go.

131
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.770
Another situation that we want to do.

132
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.470
We want to reset the scores for say scores equal to zero velocity.

133
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.340
Yeah we should go ahead zero.

134
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.220
Basically anything we have we need to go.

135
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.040
Cleared all all out for all the coin.

136
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.540
It's got to do lower case here coin X's we should say.

137
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.640
Clear on those coin wise.

138
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.500
Want to go ahead and clear those out.

139
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:57.470
Also the coin rectangles and another thing to clear and then also the coin count.

140
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.110
We are going to set that equal to zero and so many things to do.

141
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.150
Now those four things that we just had for the coins we should also do for the bombs.

142
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.710
So we're going to go ahead and pay that down.

143
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.510
But just change this to be bomb x.

144
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:16.640
Bomb wise bomb rectangles and bomb count.

145
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.420
OK.

146
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.570
So that should get us a good place to sort of start there.

147
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:27.330
Now with all of this in place let's go ahead and see what we've got.

148
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.530
You know we've hopefully made it so that when the game first starts up our little dude is just going

149
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.730
to be hanging there.

150
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:38.490
And then once the user starts interacting then that's the situation where we're going to get things

151
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.090
going.

152
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:46.500
So go ahead and oh look it already opened up and like he's ready to go soon as I touch the screen boom

153
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.930
We are live and let me grab a coin there.

154
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.700
Oh you look that.

155
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.110
And boom I hit a bomb.

156
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.030
So I had you know shows my score three and if I hit this again.

157
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.990
Look at that.

158
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.240
I'm back alive and out here running around.

159
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.250
So we're actually really really close here.

160
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:10.320
Just really the last thing that I'd like to do is make it so that when we run into a bomb that we show

161
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.650
a little bit of like a dizzied face on coin man here.

162
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.900
Remember we brought in that image.

163
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.040
Let's go ahead and look at that.

164
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.880
This dizzy one I think that would just make our game that much cooler like the user sort of understands.

165
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.040
Oh the game's over it's not just like you know it's frozen and things aren't moving forward anymore.

166
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:38.570
So what we want to do then is we go ahead and give ourselves some space when we are coming down to draw

167
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:44.770
coin man we have to make a decision about whether or not we're in the game overstate or not.

168
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:55.510
And so we are going to say here if game state is equal to two you know it's a game over situation and

169
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.310
we want coin man oh.

170
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.090
The beach ball of death here.

171
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.680
I don't know what was up with that.

172
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.650
Hopefully we can survive here.

173
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.470
All right.

174
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:15.040
So if we get if we're in game state too that's where you'd want to do the dizzy guy and then the situation

175
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:23.070
that's actually where we'd want to copy cut and paste this line are actually going to cut that and paste

176
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.810
that down below.

177
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:30.510
So then it's here this is where we want to write the situation of you know we want to drive the dizzy

178
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.860
dude instead of one of these.

179
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.490
The man in the man state.

180
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:43.410
So go ahead and just type out here Bache dot draw and rather than doing man state we have to have a

181
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.990
texture for that disease situation.

182
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:50.320
So we're going to come up to the top and make a new texture.

183
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.860
We are going to call dizzie

184
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.410
as we go.

185
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.290
And let me go ahead and stop the game so that doesn't destroy the computer here and we're going to say

186
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:15.280
dizzie should be equal to in New texture and we're going to have that be the Disney one does PLG I believe

187
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.330
that was the correct name.

188
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.630
Let's go ahead and check that dizzie one.

189
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.200
OK.

190
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.760
So make sure we put our semi-colon there.

191
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:31.920
But with that in place we should be able to come down here and say dizzie And now we have to go ahead

192
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:37.770
and put the positions in it's actually just going to be the exact same of what we had over here because

193
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.120
you know we still want coin man to be in the same place.

194
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.980
We just want to show the desi coin man and some of the other ones so it seems like usually better if

195
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:53.170
I copy and paste from the left side so go ahead and grab that pasted in.

196
00:13:53.340 --> 00:14:00.030
And this should be the final step for us so let's go ahead and test out our game big moment of truth

197
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.590
here.

198
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.570
And here we go.

199
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.240
So coin man flopping around getting some coins.

200
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.290
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

201
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.620
All right now let's run into a bomb boom.

202
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.420
I clicked through it accidentally.

203
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.290
OK.

204
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.030
Now when you want to hit a bomb you can't oh here we go.

205
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.810
So I hit it like that we got the dizzy look all around his face.

206
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.780
But as soon as we tap again we're back into a fun live mode.
