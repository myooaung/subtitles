device choose the installation folder.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,930
I'd go for the default if you've got an older version it'll ask to overwrite it.

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,330
So just click yes.

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,450
And again Jees the final installation options are to stick with all of the defaults and then let it

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,260
do its thing.

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,030
But again we'll just stick to the very standard options.

26
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,000
