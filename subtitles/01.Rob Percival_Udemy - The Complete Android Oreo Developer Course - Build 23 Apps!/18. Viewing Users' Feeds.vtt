WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.350
So the first thing that we're going to need to do is create that new activity to show particular users

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.000
feed.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.010
So let's go ahead and go up to Android studio.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.810
We're going to do file new and we want to do a new activity.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.610
Select an empty activity.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.330
And as far as a name goes maybe we could do something like user feed activity.

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.330
And with that in place we'll go ahead and hit finish there.

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.950
So let's work on the visual side of this first thing and move over to this activity.

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.860
User Frida's go ahead and give ourselves some space.

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.920
And the first thing that we want to add here is a linear layout.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.450
So let's go to our layouts.

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.830
We want a vertical linear layout because basically the idea is we're going to have a bunch of images

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.320
in here it could only be one image but it could be a ton.

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.300
So we want to have that option.

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.710
So let's go ahead and make sure this gets pushed all the way to the edges.

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.030
Go ahead and add those constraints.

17
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.370
In fact I might just go ahead and zero all these out because I want that to go to the very edge there.

18
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.880
And that and boom that is going to fill up the entire screen.

19
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.670
So with that in place let's go ahead and give this a proper ID here.

20
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.500
Let's just maybe call it when we lay out for short.

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.010
And now that we have access to that you can then go ahead and start working with it.

22
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.610
So let's move over to the user feed activity and the first thing that we want to do is we want to at

23
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.510
least prove that we can add something to this so we're just going to add that Instagram image that we

24
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.880
have and then we'll worry about downloading and stuff.

25
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.090
But first let's get access to our linear lay out which we're just going to call in lay out say this

26
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.790
is equal to fine view by IDR.

27
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.150
Indeed.

28
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.130
When you lay out good once we have access to that we want to get access to an image of you.

29
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.620
And so you're going to go.

30
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.440
We want to create a new image for you so I guess I should take a moment to mention this.

31
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.210
This linear layout we are going to programmatically add in a bunch of image views there.

32
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:23.980
So now we are creating an image view so image view will just go ahead and call it lowercase image view

33
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.650
is equal to.

34
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.150
We want to do a new image of you just like that and we're going to pass inside of here the context so

35
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.130
to say get application context and that's going to be the only thing we pass in for now.

36
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.190
Then we have to go set up the sizing for this image view.

37
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.100
So we're going to say image view.

38
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.540
Let me spell that out.

39
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.860
Image view dot.

40
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.890
And we want to do set layout and we want to do harams sort of go all the way down to the bottom there

41
00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.770
and then with this we want to do a new capital view group and we want to do the View group with just

42
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.710
parameters not the margin layout prams So just lay out programs like that and then within here we're

43
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.520
going to have some options so I'm just going to go make a new line one of the things that we're going

44
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:21.330
to do is capital view group dot lay out harams there it is down there.

45
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.710
Dot capital match parent.

46
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.100
So that's where we're going to say okay just go ahead to match the parent further with.

47
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.590
And then as far as you know the length of this thing goes so we've set the height and now we need to

48
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.400
settle the length.

49
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:42.920
We are going to say capital view group that lay out parameter not rap content.

50
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.540
So we'll go ahead and have those two things passed in.

51
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.730
So with that in place let's go ahead and then take this image view and add an image to it.

52
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.550
So we're going to take image you got set image drawable.

53
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.770
And with that we need to get access to our Instagram image that we have right inside of here if we go

54
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.000
to our drawable you can see we've got that Instagram that piano.

55
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:19.120
So what we're going to do is we need to get resources in on that we're going to say don't get drawable.

56
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.650
And then inside of there this is where we're going to pass Capitol are dot ID dot.

57
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.410
And then we want to do our Instagram oh excuse me.

58
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.470
Our dot drawable I'm so so used to doing our ID and with then we want to do Instagram like that so that

59
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.820
I'll go ahead and get what we're looking for there.

60
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.540
So with this in place we're then going to add that to our linear layout so we're going to say when lay

61
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:58.630
out dot add view and what we want to add is the image view that we just had from before.

62
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.560
Now this is all good.

63
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.640
This should add that Instagram to the image view image view into the linear layout but we have to have

64
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.430
to have to have a way to get to that.

65
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.390
So if we go back to our user list activity we want to make it so that when someone selects a particular

66
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.070
user that we can go and check that out.

67
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.130
So we're going to have to write a little bit of code here.

68
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.430
Let's get down to our on create method and that's on create the menu options.

69
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.170
Here we go.

70
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.100
So as we're going through creating the array adapter and all this different stuff.

71
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.440
After we get the list view this is where we should set up an on click listener.

72
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.670
So let's get asked access to our list view.

73
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.100
And on this we are going to say that set on item click Lessner.

74
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.610
So we need to do a new capital dafter view on click item listener.

75
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.520
And what we want to do is if someone taps on one of these we want to create an attempt to move over

76
00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.220
to the next activity so we're going to make a new intent we'll call lowercase intent and this is equal

77
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.360
to a new capital intent.

78
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.190
Let's go ahead and pass in the GET application context.

79
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.570
And we also want to pass in capital user feed activity which is that new activity that we just made

80
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.600
in the same class.

81
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.910
All right so that says where we want to go.

82
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.420
Let's go ahead and put a little bit of information in here because we want to say what user it was that

83
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.350
was selected so we can go get the images for that user.

84
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.720
We're not going to be dealing with that right now but we will need it eventually so we're going to say

85
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.160
intent put extra.

86
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:37.900
And for the term user name we want to add whatever the user name was that was selected.

87
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.840
So we're going to say user names right which is that array list to get.

88
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.960
And we want to get at position because that's the number that they selected on the particular index.

89
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.720
So with all of that in place we can say start activity in and pass the intent right inside.

90
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.180
And now we're at a position that we can go and test.

91
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:05.500
So again we're not going to have any images show up that are actual images for a particular user but

92
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.630
it should show that Instagram image that logo that we have whenever we click on any of the users.

93
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.780
So we just want to make sure that our code for adding an image view to the linear layout all works.

94
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:25.500
So we'll go ahead and give a second here to wait for this year we go it's all finished up.

95
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.800
We can see the app come in here let's sign in or let's just go ahead and make a new user we'll call

96
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.050
this user Jane password.

97
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:46.350
ABC 1 2 3 will sign up when we do that look we have some user let's say we click on one of them boom

98
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.180
look we get that image just show up.

99
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.520
Same for you know Nick gets the exact same for every user or not download anything.

100
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.220
But we know that we are able to successfully get that to work so we're in a good position there.

101
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.840
Now the next step for us is to go and actually get the image.

102
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.760
So let's move back to our user feed activity.

103
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.910
And with this we want to start doing a query where we can go get the particular image.

104
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.840
So with all of this let's go ahead and move up to the top here.

105
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:24.930
We're going to create a parse query and we will be going to be queering for PARSE objects.

106
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:30.270
So we'll go ahead and put that there and we'll just give this the name of queery and say this is equal

107
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:40.100
to a new and new parts queery parse objects and we need to look for the class of image.

108
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:40.480
Right.

109
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.700
That was the new class we created that holds all those Pansy's.

110
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.740
So with that in place you want to edit this queer little bit to make it more specific so we want to

111
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:56.280
make sure that we're only finding images for the particular username so we're going to say where equal

112
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.800
to what we want to say wherever the user name is equal to.

113
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:08.130
And then we want to go and get whatever username it is that we are working for now in order to do this

114
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:14.400
we have to go ahead and pull out the proper username from the intent.

115
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.540
So we're going to go ahead and get an intent to object.

116
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:24.400
We'll just call intent equal to get intent.

117
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:33.440
And with this intent we're going to say intent that get string extra.

118
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.600
And we're going to pass in the name of what do we define that as user name.

119
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:46.030
So we're looking for user name and I believe we have to put a default value on there which will just

120
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:58.840
do as an empty string and go ahead and look where this is intent that gets string extra string in intent

121
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.880
cannot be applied to string.

122
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.930
Looks like maybe it just needs the one.

123
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.620
OK.

124
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.140
So we're going to put this in a new string that I'm going to call

125
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.250
Maybe you just straight up username set it equal their there.

126
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.350
Now with that in place I'm going to go ahead and pass in whatever username it is that we're currently

127
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.920
looking at.

128
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.510
So that's where we'll get that check the next thing that we need to do is say where we want how they

129
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:34.260
want these images organized so we're going to say order by and you can choose you know ascending or

130
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:34.920
descending.

131
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.570
I'm going to choose order by descending with a special value called created at.

132
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:45.060
Now in order to find this we'll go back to our board here so there's a couple of fields that we didn't

133
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:51.410
set up like created that updated that object id ACL but created that just says whenever this was created

134
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.580
so we're going to use that lowercase created and then capital at.

135
00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.540
We're going to pass that and that'll make it so that we are showing the proper images first.

136
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.530
So go back to android studio.

137
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.220
Little put in created at.

138
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.490
All right with those two pieces in place we are ready to execute this query so we're going to say queery

139
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:18.930
find in background and we want to do a callback here so we're going to say new find

140
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:27.070
new capital find in me.

141
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.340
Queried dot.

142
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:35.750
Find in background I'm not sure why it's not let me not find first in background.

143
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:42.610
I just wanted to find find in the background.

144
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.690
There we go.

145
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.660
I was wondering what was wrong there.

146
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.240
They're going to get new capital find callback.

147
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.870
All right.

148
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.740
So with this in place now we're going to be able to look through stuff.

149
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.510
So first let's make a big if statements let's get a check first thing so the first thing is we should

150
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:08.920
have be equal to normal and we should also make sure that objects that size is greater than zero.

151
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:15.730
This will assure us there is no errors or exceptions and that we have at least one thing inside of this

152
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:16.660
list.

153
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:22.710
So with that then we can go ahead and do a for loop and inside this for loop we want to get parse objects

154
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:33.130
or say capital parse objects which will just call object and want to loop through this list of objects

155
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.570
with an s it's run into objects like that.

156
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.620
And since we have that in place we are going to now pull the image out of that.

157
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:47.850
So in order to do that we need to get a parse file object will just call File.

158
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:55.690
We're going to set this equal to and we need to get this from the object ring and say object not get

159
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.880
and we are going to pass in the term we want the image.

160
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.160
This is going to give us back a parse file write like that remember that name image.

161
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:13.420
So over here we've got to make sure that we cast this to be a parse image or parse file so we know that

162
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.580
that's what's coming back there.

163
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.290
Then the next step for us is we have to download once we have a part file we have to download the image

164
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:20.920
data from that.

165
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.150
So first we went and got all of the objects the image objects.

166
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.900
Now we're downloading the actual images from those image objects.

167
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:39.640
So we're going to say file that get data in background so amazing that parse just makes one line things

168
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.390
like if we were writing this out on our own.

169
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.580
Oh my goodness.

170
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.680
So much work to do.

171
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.960
But we want to do a new get data callback.

172
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.190
So it's going to call this function when it's gone and gotten everything that it needs.

173
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.850
So let's make sure we have the appropriate data in this statement.

174
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.160
Of course check make sure that is equal to nil.

175
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.610
And we're going to make sure that the data is OK by making sure that that is not equal to nil.

176
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:08.680
So if we have that situation that means that we have an image so then we can go ahead and create a bitmap

177
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.300
so we're going to say bitmap.

178
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:16.540
We'll just call this bitmap is equal to capital.

179
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:28.170
We want a bitmap factory dot decoded by and or excuse me decoded byte array.

180
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.500
And with this we're going to go ahead and pass in the data that we got which is a byte array.

181
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:40.180
And we're also then going to say any sort of offsets that we need know nothing the length.

182
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.560
Let's just go ahead and say the length of data there.

183
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.810
And then finally it's going to ask if we want the options.

184
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.970
I guess that's an optional thinks we'll go ahead leave that blank.

185
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:56.010
All right so with this bitmap then we need to do our regular code of you know go create an image view

186
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:56.910
added to the layout.

187
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:57.660
All that good stuff.

188
00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:03.870
So I'm just going to go copy all this code that we have where we get the linear lay out and do all of

189
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.210
that and set it up except for I guess that linearly out I'm going to declare that earlier.

190
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.070
So we're going to pace that inside this linear lay.

191
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:18.070
We're going to add this up to the top but we need to make sure that this can be accessed anywhere so

192
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:24.430
I'm going to cut this paste it up above and say this is where we're setting.

193
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.730
Lay out.

194
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.360
So that should fix that code.

195
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.290
So I'll go ahead and give this a run.

196
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:35.380
Again the basic idea is we're doing a query to say hey give me all the image objects for a particular

197
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.470
user that has this user name once we found those.

198
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:44.200
We're going to get the parse files from them for the actual image data download that we're then going

199
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.780
to create an image view add this bitmap that we downloaded.

200
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.990
Add that to the linear layout and that should then be displayed.

201
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.810
So sort of a multi-step process here but let's go ahead and give it a try.

202
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.130
So the only person who has an image is John I believe.

203
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.020
So let's go ahead and look at it for John's.

204
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:07.530
We're going to tap on John and oh do we have an Instagram image.

205
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.730
Well I think I know why that is.

206
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.060
And that's because I forgot to change this code.

207
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:18.700
He's still showing the Instagram image so we're going to go ahead and delete this to wear now instead

208
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:24.040
of setting an image drawable this is where we want to set an actual bitmaps are going to say set image

209
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.290
bitmap and then we'll use the bitmap again.

210
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:32.170
Copy paste is great but you've got to be careful because they'll be little bits and pieces that you

211
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.330
forget the changes I just did.

212
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.420
And it leads to wacky results like this.

213
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:43.520
So go ahead and get the emulator click on John and boom.

214
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.000
Look at that.

215
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.950
His image shows up.

216
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:51.110
So that is successfully working you could say we have a finished project but there's kind of one big

217
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.010
glaring thing here.

218
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.820
There's a little well some other pieces too.

219
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.070
But the big one is let's say I want to log out and I want to come back in as another user.

220
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.320
There's no way to do that right now.

221
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.190
All we can do is share or look at users posts.

222
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.690
We'd have to delete this app off our phone and then reopen it which you know that's not an ideal user

223
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.740
experience.

224
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:14.590
So let's go ahead and add another menu item here that allows us to log out.

225
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:20.630
So what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our side menu here and open up or open up this

226
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.860
menu to edit the menu.

227
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.120
That's kind of funny.

228
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:28.400
We're going to add another item so I'm going to just copy and paste this and this one we're going to

229
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.490
call log out and it's going to have the ID of all lowercase.

230
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.160
Log out.

231
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.650
All right we can go ahead and close that up but now we are going to have to add some new code for whenever

232
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:40.690
we want to do this.

233
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:47.300
So let's go back to our user list activity and we'll go up to the function when someone selects a particular

234
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:47.990
item.

235
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.920
So right now we're just checking to see if it's the share ID.

236
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:57.050
Let's go ahead and do another if statement where we say else if and we'll check and see if it's equal

237
00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.210
to the log out.

238
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:07.910
We're going to say item that get item ID and see if this is equal to our ID dot log out.

239
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:15.140
So if it is a log out what we want to do is we want to log the user out which is just getting a parse

240
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:15.860
user.

241
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:20.110
All caps dot log out as simple as that.

242
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.050
And you could just leave it there but we do want to go ahead and move back to the logon screen.

243
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:31.850
So we're going to say capital intent to make another variable called intent say this is equal to a new

244
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:38.240
capital intent where first we're going to get the application context and then we're going to say hey

245
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.900
go and move on over to the main activity.

246
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:46.620
So we'll pass that in and then we just simply want to start that activity.

247
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.260
So we'll go ahead and do that and pass in the intent that we had created.

248
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.010
So with that in place let's go ahead and run this

249
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.240
and we'll wait for our emulator here

250
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.530
while it is running.

251
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.060
I saw a little bit of an issue.

252
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.920
I mean you're going to see it here but I don't like the title that we have showing currently It says

253
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.700
parce start a project which is kind of tacky.

254
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.790
But anyways if we go ahead and hit this log button boom at that we come back to the screen.

255
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.650
I can go ahead and put back in.

256
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.110
Wow.

257
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.960
Who was the user that we just created was it.

258
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.310
Jane Jane ABC 1 2 3.

259
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.420
I want to do a log in with that and look at that.

260
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:40.230
We got logged in again but we can always come out but I don't like this title.

261
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.700
I don't like when we log out.

262
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.680
This says Park start a project like all these are kind of a little bit tacky here.

263
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.980
So what we're going to do is first move to our user list activity.

264
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.640
We'll go to our user list activity and we're going to want to set that title inside of the on create

265
00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:03.100
So we're going to go down to our on create and we'll say just simply set title.

266
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.940
It's that simple and we'll just pass in the string of user feed.

267
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:15.370
And with this we'll go ahead and also set the title on that homescreen So we're going to go back to

268
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.500
our main activity.

269
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.040
And I guess we could also go a step further.

270
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.460
Let's see Jane you see one two three.

271
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.560
Sign up.

272
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.400
Whoops.

273
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.670
We want to do log in.

274
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.030
Thank you.

275
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.310
Our message you reminded me what was going on there.

276
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.300
We also want to do that for that particular image.

277
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.320
We'll update that as well.

278
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.720
But in the main activity let's get to it's create method.

279
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.650
We'll just go ahead and say here.

280
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:49.090
I should probably do this after these two lines of code will say set title and I'll just pass inside

281
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.900
of here insta gram Kang.

282
00:20:54.190 --> 00:21:00.520
And then the last place that we want to do this is inside of our user feed activity here on this on

283
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.090
Create say set title.

284
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:08.590
And if you really want to get fancy we could use the user name so in fact if we go ahead and do this

285
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.450
intend to code my cut and paste as above.

286
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:20.490
We could say something like you know that particular user names photos so we'll say user name plus then

287
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.880
we'll do a string here apostrophe S..

288
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.210
Photos like that.

289
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.660
So let's go ahead and run this.

290
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.910
This is just going to have that little bit of polish that I always recommend that we add to our apps.

291
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:40.120
So wait for our emulator friend here to load up.

292
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.960
And here it comes.

293
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.520
Here it comes.

294
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.380
Here it comes.

295
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:48.850
So you can see if we click on John like that's now says John's photos that's pretty cool.

296
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:54.190
We can hit back this as user feed and if we log out it says Instagram.

297
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.060
So congratulations on creating this Instagram app.

298
00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.710
This was a really full fledged app.

299
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.030
We're really focused some of our other sections you know we kind of learned a bunch of concepts and

300
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:09.520
made different apps as we went along but this time we focused all in on this one particular app and

301
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.920
that's sort of the same method that we're going to follow.

302
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.810
Going forward we still will have some variety when it comes to different sections but I hope you enjoyed

303
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:22.240
putting a little more time and effort into one particular app and making this awesome multi activity

304
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.080
app that we have here.

305
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.170
So great work.

306
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.990
We got more to cover so let's keep movin.
