1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,280
Well I'm so excited that you're here for the Copland section.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,360
Like I said in the intro this is one of my favorite sections because I think Collins just so exciting.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,360
I personally think it's going to be the next big thing an Android development and just all Java development.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,720
In general it just to me is so much better than Java.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,000
I love programming with it.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,780
I think beginners will be able to pick it up better than Java and it is just gaining so much popularity.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,650
If you just go ahead and google Codlin popularity I mean you're just going to get tons of results here

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,060
and I just checked out a few of these.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,740
But I mean big big you know rising star here.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,180
Codlin I believe in Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:53,570
And so for example on this I've never know how to pronounce this tyo Bay tyo Bay index here.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,320
If we go ahead and look at job it's the number one programming language in the world.

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,800
Now it's slowly.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,960
Well I don't know about slowly it's pretty quickly dying from that position and it's you know coming

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,720
down it had a real dominance at one point and I think that's because a lot of people are seen.

16
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,160
Java is you know a little bit outdated.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,530
Some of these other programming languages are much easier to work with and that's the case with Cartland.

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,440
So if cotland can keep getting the globe growing popularity and all these top Java developers will start

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,740
switching to cotland.

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,490
I think we're really going to see Collin's shoot up because right now Cartland it's way down here let's

21
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,870
go ahead and see.

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,390
Yeah it's position 48 right now which I'm sure you know.

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,080
Years ago when it started it was down maybe in the hundreds or something like that.

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,580
But I mean just to be on this list is a pretty big deal but when you look at its potential of where

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,080
it could go Cartland is just an awesome investment to get into right now.

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,870
I think and come in for an awesome thing about Collen is if you know Java you'll be able to pick up

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,580
KOPPLIN very quickly and you know it's not too big of a switch.

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,850
So well it is a switch.

29
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,490
I mean that's why we have this section here to teach you all about it.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,240
But you know I don't think it's like earth shattering or anything like that.

31
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,730
So just start here.

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,160
I honestly think the best way to learn how to work with Java is to use this intelligent idea.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,510
So these are actually the same people behind helping to create Android studio but I find their program

34
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,790
to be better for just this one individually focused on just being an idea for Java or Cotman.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,320
And so we want to go ahead and take this and use it to first learn Kotla and then we'll come back and

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,980
make some apps with Kollin an android studio.

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,470
So go ahead and go to Jepp brainstorm com slash idea that gives you this intelligent idea.

38
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,450
So we'll go ahead and download this.

39
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,440
And whatever your operating system is.

40
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,680
Go ahead and get that now.

41
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,870
There's the ultimate version which is got all these bells and whistles and stuff.

42
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,700
The big one is looking for is that it has Cartland which this free open source one has and so we're

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,130
going to go ahead and use that again.

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,080
I don't think we're going to need any of these so we'll go ahead and get the community option here.

45
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,940
So wait for this download page and boom that starts coming through.

46
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:20,910
OK.

47
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,660
Now I have already gone through and gotten intelligence all downloaded and installed so I'm going to

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,830
go ahead and open that up on my computer and go to my applications.

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,600
And let's get to delegate.

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,180
There we go

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,090
wait for this to pop open here.

52
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,640
Yeah by the end of this lecture you will have written your very first line of Cartland code which will

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,250
be great.

54
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,070
So really excited for you to check that out.

55
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,530
All right.

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,040
So this opens up and this had a project that I was working on before.

57
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,420
So I think we can probably go ahead and close out of this and we want to start a new project so as you

58
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,440
can tell.

59
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,110
Yes very similar to Android studio.

60
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,230
You can tell it like the same people you know have been working on that.

61
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:25,420
So we want to create a new project and you can choose what type of project you want to do here so there's

62
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,220
you know the classic Java stuff.

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,500
But for us we want Cartland and we want the Cartland slash JVM.

64
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,460
You can use cotland that will be converted into javascript.

65
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,300
That is a very interesting subject that I cover and a separate course that's just focused purely on

66
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,930
Kollin but for this one we want Koblenz flash JVM.

67
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,700
So go ahead and select that then we're going to need a project name.

68
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,710
And I think we should just kind of have a little file that we can use to play around with and have fun.

69
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:01,500
So I'm just going to go ahead and call this cotland fun and I'm going to save this into my idea of projects.

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:09,610
Remember that's the name of this ID and I'm working on STK one point eight and we'll go ahead and just

71
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,690
use the Cartland Java runtime.

72
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,190
So go ahead and hit finish there.

73
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,390
And if we go over here to the left you can see some of the files that we're going to have.

74
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:29,060
So there's these dot idea files these are all have to do with the actual you know idea getting things

75
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,780
set up for you.

76
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,680
But it's inside of the source where we want to work.

77
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,840
So in here we want to go ahead and create a new file.

78
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:44,090
So we're going to make a new and we want it to be a cotland file so we can call this whatever we'd like.

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,660
Maybe let's go ahead and call this one something like Hello Kitty.

80
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,270
Because this is sort of like our Hello world.

81
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,850
Now in order to be able to run some code here there's a few things that we've got to do and the first

82
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,380
one is we have to create a main function.

83
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,930
So when you just have an independent Scotland file you have to have this main function that says I'm

84
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,600
running this essentially it's like if you're running from the command line.

85
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,310
But what we're going to do is we're going to type out here just start typing main.

86
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,080
You should get an auto complete where you can hit enter and then that's going to pop up this function

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,280
main args and don't really worry about you know what's this main function.

88
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,340
How does it get called.

89
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,910
But just know everything inside of these curly brackets is code that we can run.

90
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,800
So for example if we want to write our very first line of code here like let's just print something

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,770
out which is essentially the same thing as logging.

92
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,250
We'll just go ahead and say print line and we'll put inside of here a new string that says Hello Codlin

93
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,400
exclamation point and look at this is so cool in cotland you don't need semi-colons that's one of the

94
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
many pluses that you're going to see here with Caitlin.

95
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,990
But once we have that in place we have our main function we have a line of code there.

96
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm going to open up our SIRC here and I'm going to select our Hello Dom.

97
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,440
The Cartland files and and Katie we're going to Right-Click click and we're going to say run.

98
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,220
Hello Katy.

99
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,120
So it's going to go run this file and it's going to spit out some information for us about anything

100
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,320
that we print for example here.

101
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,110
Printin Hello Caitlin.

102
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,040
OK.

103
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,020
So go ahead and wait for this to pop up and you can see down on the bottom there's lots of different

104
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,210
text with all sorts of different colors but just know the stuff that's in black is the stuff that's

105
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,820
been printed.

106
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,110
And so there we can see the yellow cotton column.

107
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,250
And now that we've run this for the first time we don't have to right click this file anymore to say

108
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,700
run instead we can just go ahead and hit this run button up top and that will automatically do it for

109
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:43,920
us.

110
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,330
So any changes that we want to make we can go ahead and just do it right here.

111
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,490
So I have for you about an hour's worth of lectures that are going to teach you about the basics of

112
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,350
cotland for someone with a Java background.

113
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,840
I recorded these for my cotland programming course.

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,810
And so this is specifically for your situation right.

115
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,190
We've been through a bunch of apps you know Java pretty solidly now but you just want to know about

116
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,920
Cartland.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,350
So I'm going to teach you the basics.

118
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,700
I'm going to run you through all those videos then I'm going to have some extra special lectures for

119
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,050
you at the end of that to say OK you've made it up to this point with Kopplin.

120
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,090
Now let me take you one step further and show you how it all works with Android studio and whatnot.

121
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,630
So I'll go ahead and pass the torch off to the other me.

122
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,740
Go ahead and start learning cutline.
