00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.520
Hello and welcome to the section on making games for Android this is going to be a really fun section.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520
I enjoyed it.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.340
I like it personally because I think it's fun to work with all the images that comes with games also

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.870
like the math and the physics side that comes with that.

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.780
Be alerted if you're not a huge math fan you might find this a little bit uncomfortable but the app

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.340
that we're going to be making or rather the game that we're going to be making in a section is called

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.280
coin man and the idea is we have this little coin dude.

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.260
He's running along the bottom the screen any time we tap on the screen we can make coin man jump up

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.310
and grab some coins are going to be floating across the screen.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.950
Now there's also going to be some bombs that every once in awhile are flowing across the screen and

11
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
if coin man accidently hits one of those well then he loses the game.

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.690
And your score is essentially stopped and then you know you can start the game back up.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.110
But that's what we're moving towards to build.

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.670
So we're going to be using this awesome gaming library called lib GDX So go to lib GDX.

15
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.110
Not bad logic games.

16
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.130
Com.

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.970
This is where we can download this gaming platform to allow us to make this game.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570
So we're going to go ahead and just hit download here.

19
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.180
We want to click on download the setup app and this is going to download a java file so because we already

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.010
got Java installed on our computer we're going to have no issues here so I'll just go ahead and open

21
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.340
up this file.

22
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.920
And as I say that will have no issues.

23
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.930
The only issue that you can have is if security gets in the way so I'm going to go on my Mac and say

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.290
yes to this if you don't know how to do this you can go to your system preferences and you're going

25
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:43.450
to go over to security and click this to enter in your password and then now when we go to open this

26
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.130
we're going to say open anyways allow us to open that java file.

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.070
OK.

28
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.410
So this is going to help us set up our game.

29
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.320
So go ahead and give it some sort of name.

30
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.490
I'm going to call this coin man as far as package goes.

31
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.300
Go ahead call us whatever you want.

32
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm going to do something like Comet Zappy code coign man game.

33
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.810
And then for the game class this has to be all one word to capitalize the first letter.

34
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.570
This is like making a class in Java.

35
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.920
So I'm going to call this capital coin.

36
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.890
No space man.

37
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.860
All right.

38
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.150
The next thing that we need is where it is that we want to save this so I'm going to go ahead and just

39
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.000
put this on the desktop for the time being.

40
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.640
So go ahead and move that there.

41
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.830
And also for the Android SDK if we go ahead and open up Android studio it will tell us where the path

42
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.180
to our SDK is.

43
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.970
So all that's opening up as far as subprojects go what's cool about this lib digi x is it can work for

44
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.040
iOS schemes.

45
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.720
Desktop you of all but for us we just want it to be working for Android so we're going to uncheck everything

46
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.490
else.

47
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.230
Leave box to de-selected but don't have anything else selected there.

48
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.080
Now here with Android studio if we go to its preferences if we go under appearance and behavior system

49
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.830
settings Android SDK up at the top here it's going to list out where your SDK is on your machine so

50
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.050
wherever you have this just go ahead and copy it and paste it exactly here into this box.

51
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.360
And with this we're going to go ahead and hit generate So was going to say hey you've got a more advanced

52
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.720
version.

53
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.990
Yes.

54
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.180
Go ahead say yes say yes to this as well.

55
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.420
And the saying The destination is not empty.

56
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.930
You want to overwrite you.

57
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.710
So this we're going to say no so we want to actually put a folder on our desktops.

58
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.180
Let's make a new folder called coin man.

59
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.210
So we'll go ahead and use that.

60
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.910
And now let's do this one more time.

61
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.760
So this will go through creating this project this is going to take a little bit of time but it's actually

62
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.700
going to create an android studio project for us which then we can you know open up and start editing

63
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.870
code for us so we'll just go ahead and give it a second here to finish up and look at that.

64
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.840
It is all finished.

65
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.670
So once we have that we're going to come back to android studio here and we're going to open an existing

66
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.470
project.

67
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.430
And this is where I want to go straight to our desktop and open up coin case so we'll go ahead and give

68
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.590
this a second to load up here.

69
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.670
The sort of default version that they start off with is just sort of a basic version of a game.

70
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.640
I mean there's really no game mechanics I mean it's just like a red background with their logo there.

71
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.440
But it's least it's a starting point and they're going to have all the right files in the right places

72
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.140
so that's going to be nice for us.

73
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.250
So as soon as this opens up let's see we're asking to upgrade here yes let's go ahead and update that

74
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.890
and give that a second to load there.

75
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.410
So once that finishes we want to go ahead and hit our run button here so that we can get our emulator

76
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.580
up and running as quickly as possible because it's going to take some time to open up.

77
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.760
So we'll go ahead and get that moving.

78
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.020
Let me go ahead and just walk you through what we have here.

79
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.110
So there's actually two projects that you're going to see here where we'll write all her code is inside

80
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.360
of this core and if we go down to coin man here double click on this.

81
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.590
This is I mean ninety nine percent of the time is going to be spent right here getting everything set

82
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.110
up.

83
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.120
Even all the visual stuff at all happens via code right here.

84
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.060
And then up here this android project really all that we're going to work with over here is we're going

85
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.110
to be adding some images to this asset folder here.

86
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.490
So they included one called Bad logic.

87
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.440
This is you know their logo and you're going to see this inside of the example app that's going to come

88
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.240
up here in a second.

89
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.040
But just know between these two places this coin man file inside of core this is where we're going to

90
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.850
spend 99 percent of our time.

91
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.240
And then a little bit of time moving some assets here inside of the Android side of things.

92
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.360
So what's going on here.

93
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:08.920
Well there's three main functions inside of a game and they create render and dispose.

94
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.040
So create is called when you open it up for the very first time and sort of get your game ready to go

95
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.590
any things you only want to do one time.

96
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:24.180
Now render this is a really special method because this gets run over and over and over and over until

97
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.060
you finish the game which eventually at some point this Dispose is going to be called.

98
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.250
I'll be honest with our game this Dispose is never going to be called because this is it.

99
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.450
You know if you want at some point and the game and sort of start a new one but I mean we're going to

100
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.470
do that in a way that we don't even have to do this so don't worry too much about this dispose function.

101
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.710
I mean really it's this create where we set things up for the first time in this render where we're

102
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.880
really going to spend our time.

103
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.660
So right now in the create this batch this is sort of the starting point for app we use this batch called

104
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.980
sprite batch to draw everything to the screen.

105
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.120
I know it's a little bit weird to say that you're drawing something to the screen but essentially putting

106
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.040
something visually on the screen.

107
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.170
So any time you work at bats that means we're putting something on the screen then we're creating this

108
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.200
thing called an image which is the texture.

109
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.010
So textures are created from images I believe you can also make textures with solid colors but we'll

110
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.610
just be working with images.

111
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:28.440
And then here inside the render we're basically saying hey we're going to go ahead and make a background

112
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.820
color here it's going to be a red one.

113
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.250
And then we're going to draw this image onto the screen again drawing is basically showing.

114
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.300
So go ahead and open up our emulator here.

115
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.210
Let's get this opened up.

116
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.700
And here comes our app and there you can see the light.

117
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.210
It's not even in the correct position but at least we got to opening there's that red background and

118
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.340
the image showing up.

119
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.140
So we do have a little bit of work to do here but at least we've got the project up and running in the

120
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.750
next one we'll start creating this game.
