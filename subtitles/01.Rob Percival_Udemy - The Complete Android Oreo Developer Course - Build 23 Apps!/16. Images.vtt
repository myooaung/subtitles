00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.260
So just before we build our currency converter app we're going to learn one new skill and that is how

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.200
to add images to our apps.

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.290
Images are a great way to make your app visually appealing and interesting and they're super easy to

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.200
add in under a studio.

5
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.690
So let's just start by grabbing a couple of images.

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.570
I'm a big fan of cats so I'm going to go for a couple of cat images.

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.000
There we go.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.580
Lovely.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.980
Worth saying at this point that if you want to use an actual image that you find on the web in one of

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.910
your real apps and you should make sure that rewrites of the image allows you to.

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.360
But if you're just using images to test your apps for yourself then you can use anything you like.

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.870
So I'm going to take this one and control click and save image downloads.

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.590
Notice this image is pretty big 2500 about 2500.

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.110
So I'm actually going to jump over to the finder and just edit the image to bring it down to a smaller

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.490
size so that we won't have any problems with the app running out of memory when it tries to load the

16
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.250
image on Mac.

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.180
This is pretty easy.

18
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.750
You can just double click on the image to open it in preview and then click Tools adjust size and then

19
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.190
I'm going to change to pixels and we'll change it to about 500.

20
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:30.280
That'll be plenty for our purposes and then save and close that down.

21
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.070
And next we'll have

22
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.440
this one here looks quite adorable.

23
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.670
So again control click.

24
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.670
This one is a much smaller image.

25
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.410
So we'll use it in its present form.

26
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.520
I'm just going to rename those to Cat 1 and Cat 2.

27
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.890
Notice that different types.

28
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.140
We got a j peg and AP ngi file both of those will load fine within your Android app.

29
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.350
You don't need to convert them to a specific type.

30
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.390
All right so now back over to Andrei studio and to bring in our images we bring back our project structure.

31
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.580
And you may remember the resources folder.

32
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.240
That's where we're going to put our images.

33
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.790
So just open it up and then open up the drawable folder and that's where we'll drag out images into.

34
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.300
Now if you're running Windows you can just select both of those and drag them straight into the drawable

35
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.110
folder.

36
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.860
But on Mac Unfortunately that doesn't work.

37
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.200
You have to do a slightly more complicated process command C to copy to the clipboard and then click

38
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.150
on the trouble folder and then command the to paste and then click OK.

39
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.600
Copy the files.

40
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.140
And there they are.

41
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.770
So now we can use Cat 1 and Cat 2 in our app and adding them.

42
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.070
It's pretty straightforward.

43
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.660
We go back over to our lay out the activity main SML and came we've got a list of our widgets I can't

44
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.240
see image that.

45
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.790
So I'm just going to click on the search button and type image and there we go.

46
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.620
We want Image view.

47
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.440
We don't need our image to be a button.

48
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.870
Let's bring in our image that we get and we can choose an image right there that we want to use for

49
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.320
it.

50
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.890
So I'll go for that one for now.

51
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.710
Click OK.

52
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.530
And there it is.

53
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.350
Simple as that.

54
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.070
Just give us a bit more room.

55
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.050
The only thing we'll want to be aware of is how to lay out our image.

56
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.170
So at the moment is a little bit off the edge of the screen.

57
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.560
So of course you can resize and add margins in exactly the same way that you would any other element

58
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.740
that's going to drag it back in.

59
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.770
The only thing I want to bring to your attention here is the scale type which offers a variety of different

60
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.320
ways

61
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.090
of squeezing your image into the image container so you can try those out.

62
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.200
They're all reasonably self-explanatory probably fit center.

63
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.790
It's going to be most likely what you want that will fit it and center it will be as large as possible

64
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.310
but you'll be able to see the whole image within the box.

65
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.170
There we go.

66
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.880
All right.

67
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.720
So that's how you add images to your apps.

68
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.660
Super easy.

69
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.980
But of course I want to give you a bit of a challenge to practice this and it's going to extend your

70
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.560
skills a little bit as well.

71
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.280
So what we're going to make is this.

72
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.120
Now on the surface it looks like just the image of our cat.

73
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.850
But it does something a little bit special and that is when we tap the button it changes the image to

74
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.070
our second cat.

75
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.560
And that's why we downloaded to cat images in the first place.

76
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.060
So to complete this challenge you're going to need to do a little bit of googling online to find how

77
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.760
you update the image within an image view using code.

78
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.740
When a button is pressed that will be a good bit of practice for you finding solutions to coding problems

79
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.430
online.

80
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.810
One other small thing that you might come across is aligning this button at the bottom right there.

81
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.930
That's not quite as easy as it might seem.

82
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.430
I'll give you a little hint.

83
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:47.690
I'd recommend looking in all attributes and then look at the constraint options and play around with

84
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.870
a few of those and see if you can make the button align to the bottom right of the screen.

85
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.770
OK.

86
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.760
So a little bit more than the usual challenge.

87
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.580
Show your rise to it.

88
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.420
Best of luck.

89
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.730
All right.

90
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.010
Well here we go.

91
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.410
So I'm going to start a new project

92
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.460
I'm going to call it kept switching

93
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.650
next and all that effort options again having done this four or five times should be pretty straightforward

94
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.450
for you.

95
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.160
And here we go.

96
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.380
So let's begin by bringing our images into our apps.

97
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.490
We know how to do that now.

98
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:46.480
So just select them in the Finder or Windows Explorer and then paste into the drawable folder.

99
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.810
Open not quite ready yet.

100
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.990
Dragon Habegger.

101
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.630
All right.

102
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.890
So we've got our images.

103
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:13.930
Now I'm going to get rid of Welte search for my image view and then drag it in and we'll sort of with

104
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.060
that one and then switch to Kattie.

105
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.420
We guys are going to try to make it full screen.

106
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.980
Lovely.

107
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.360
And we'll set the scale type as we did before to fit Senda.

108
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.270
And we just set the margins as well.

109
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.800
So it will be full screen on any device.

110
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:44.870
I'll change the ID to cat image view so that we know which image view we're talking about even though

111
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:53.880
we've only got one and then we just need a button to be switched on and we'll put the button on top

112
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.660
of the image.

113
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.420
The bottom right of the screen

114
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:06.850
and I'll call it kept switch button

115
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:16.140
and on click in a minute all create the method.

116
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.780
Switch

117
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.170
OK.

118
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:29.490
Now we're going to go over and write some code one habit that I think it's worth getting in see is just

119
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.920
running your app as soon as you've created the layout.

120
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.530
That just means that all the set up can be done while you're writing some code and then it's much quicker

121
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.060
to run it when you're actually ready to test it out.

122
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:41.850
All right.

123
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:49.740
So let's write our method called Switchcraft as we're used to.

124
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.910
It's going to be a public method that doesn't return anything.

125
00:08:53.910 --> 00:09:05.940
It's called switch cat and it accepts a variable of a type with a capital V old and had the view class

126
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:15.830
and that variable will be called view with a little of it and for now we'll just do a quick log.

127
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:33.870
Let us know that the button has been pressed OK let's check our app.

128
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:42.130
Oh and we've got a bit of an issue that the button is at the top left and we want it at the bottom right.

129
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.700
So let's just see how we're going to achieve that.

130
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.150
As is often the case there's a number of different ways of doing it.

131
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:56.960
By the way I'm going to show you is the way I use most often and that is to look at the more advanced

132
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:06.230
constraints list in the attributes list and then we want the bottom of the bottom to be aligned to the

133
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:17.370
bottom of this box here which is our constraint lay out which is the parent element of the button.

134
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:24.930
So that will now align the button to the bottom of the parent element and we also want the right of

135
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:33.000
the button to be aligned to the right of the parent element that should do it.

136
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:43.910
If you want to add in a bit of a margin just so that it's not completely at the bottom right then you

137
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.230
can do that as well.

138
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.980
Maybe 10.

139
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.330
OK.

140
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.490
Just going to run that again just to be sure that the button is now displaying where we wanted to be.

141
00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:00.290
It looks like with those areas that we have set up the constraints correctly.

142
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.280
Let's find out

143
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.380
and there we go.

144
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.790
Wonderful.

145
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:14.160
So how have you managed to solve that somewhere or other as we've written our code already we should

146
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.340
be able to tap the button and get a response in the logs Let's have a look.

147
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.340
Yep.

148
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.450
Brilliant.

149
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:23.380
OK.

150
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:30.960
So all that remains is to work out how to switch the image from the first cat to the second using the

151
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.070
button.

152
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.780
And as I suggested earlier going to do a quick Google search to see if we can find a solution to this.

153
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:47.940
Now when you're searching for Android development code I normally put both Android and Java at the beginning

154
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:58.740
of my search and then I'll go for something like Update image dynamically dynamically implies that we

155
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.190
want to do it automatically using code as we go.

156
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.970
Top result takes us to a Web site called Stack Overflow.

157
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.350
If you're a seasoned coda you've doubtless gone to a stack overflow many many times.

158
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.070
If you're not then get used to it.

159
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:19.730
It's a really great site where people answer each other's questions and it almost always appears at

160
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:24.180
the top of Google when you search for a coding question like we just did.

161
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.770
OK so looking at the top answer here this looks to be exactly what we want.

162
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.690
So it's worth taking a moment to make sure that the code does what we think it does.

163
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:41.930
So we're creating an image free variable called image which is of a type image view and finds the image

164
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.060
view that's already in place.

165
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:51.560
Greg we've got one of those and then it just sets the image resolves to a specific resource inside the

166
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.870
drawable resources area.

167
00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:02.120
Looks pretty perfect so let's copy that with Control-C and then

168
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.720
paste it into our code.

169
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.590
When the old enter to get the image view class and of course we need to update the code to make sure

170
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.800
it works with our own app.

171
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.900
We don't have an image we call test image.

172
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.610
We have an image view called or with an idea of cat imagery.

173
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.710
So let's update that to cat image.

174
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:31.930
There we go.

175
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.390
And then we want to set the image results.

176
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:41.070
We don't have a little code x x x how one is called Cat 2.

177
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.630
And there we go.

178
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:49.800
So that should update our image view from Cat 1 to Cat 2.

179
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.490
Let's take a look.

180
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.350
The button.

181
00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.450
There we go.

182
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.120
Fantastic.

183
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.990
So I hope you figured out how to do that yourself if you didn't worry.

184
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.150
Early days yet you'll definitely get the hang of searching online for solutions to programming problems.

185
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:14.490
All right so now we've mastered images going to build our big app for this section which is our currency

186
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.450
converter.
