00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.030
Hello and welcome to this lecture we're we're going to be creating a VR app using Google's vr package

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.160
which includes daydream and cardboard.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.120
And if you're wondering about the differences between cardboard and daydream daydream is much more advanced.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.300
It requires specific hardware.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.640
So some more advanced type of Android phones to run and you need special headsets and a remote that

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.500
comes with it.

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.520
But luckily Google has included everything and sort of one V.R. package so making stuff or daydream

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.360
and cardboard we can sort of flip the switch.

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.600
Not too hard there.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.500
So in order to get this running I believe the best way to create a VR game is going to be using unity.

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.180
At least that's what my vr friends tell me.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.580
I'm not an expert in VR by any means in fact the main focus of this is to get you started and get a

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.990
little sample project up and running and see how you can then work with that.

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.390
And again unity is the platform that we're going to use to do this because they are so great with 3D

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.120
programs.

16
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.980
So the first step for us is we've got to get unity on a computer if you don't already have that.

17
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.960
So let's go ahead and open up a browser and just search for unity.

18
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.700
There's going to be the first thing that pops up once you're to the site you just want to go ahead and

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.800
say get unity.

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.350
And if you click on this it's going to have different options here we just want the personal version.

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.000
So just say personal.

22
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.460
That's going to say hey you're not using this to make hundreds of thousands of dollars.

23
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.390
Are you saying no I'm just trying to figure this out.

24
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.440
For the first time.

25
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.500
So if you click this it's going to give you download option here so that you can get unity and that's

26
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.680
actually pretty small file but it's this thing that you open that it's going to allow you to then get

27
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.280
more advanced.

28
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.980
We're going to open up this unity download assistant and you'll just want to go ahead and go through

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.330
here and you know say agree or not to different things here.

30
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.360
As far as the things that you need make sure you have Android build support checked.

31
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.520
And I would have these top four ones so unity Monteux develop documentation and standard assets.

32
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.360
You can choose which ones you like but I feel like those are the minimum that you should have.

33
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.190
So just go ahead and hit continue and move forward with that and that will install everything.

34
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.030
So I already have everything on my computer so I'm not going to go through that install process.

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.160
Plus it takes quite a while there's some chunky files that we've got to go download the next thing that

36
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.540
we need.

37
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.930
So that's unity.

38
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.710
The next thing that we need is Google.

39
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.420
Just search google V.R. SDK.

40
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.960
And this is going to show you what you need.

41
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.010
So with this go ahead looks like it is our top result developers dot Google dot com slash V.R. slash

42
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.760
unity.

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.700
So you can download Google's VR stuff for iOS Android unity.

44
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.790
Unreal.

45
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.960
But again I think unity is the best option.

46
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.600
Even better than just straight up native Android.

47
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.820
So when you get here we want to go ahead and scroll down to the download so we want to get the Google

48
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.340
vr SDK for unity.

49
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.370
So go ahead and click on this you agree to their terms and conditions and hit download.

50
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.950
Is going to take you to the get home page where it's going to have the latest releases.

51
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.130
And so I mean new stuff is coming out all the time so don't worry too much about what version you have.

52
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.220
We're going to be using version 1.1 10 but we'll just go ahead and hit download on that.

53
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.710
And that's going to start a whole download process I actually already have that on my computer so that's

54
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.080
why it's not showing up there.

55
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.550
But once you have that in place you're ready to move forward.

56
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.420
So with that go ahead and once you have unity installed go ahead and open that up unity.

57
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.900
OK.

58
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.640
And you're going to have to sign and you're going to have to create an account.

59
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.580
You can do that with just you know your e-mail account or you know Facebook whatever it is that you

60
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.880
want.

61
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:59.530
But let's go ahead and start a new project and hope yours somehow lost inside of here.

62
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.090
Here we go.

63
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.830
So we want to create a new project.

64
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.940
Call us whatever you want.

65
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.590
I'm just going to maybe call mine learning Android and spell that correctly you can choose where you

66
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.250
want to put this.

67
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.160
I'm going to put mine on the desktop.

68
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.730
And with that we'll go ahead and say create project.

69
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.640
The one thing I should have mentioned make sure you have 3-D selected there will be an important one

70
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.170
so unity will open up here and again unity.

71
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.710
Unity is a program that allows us to create 3D environments and all sorts of gaming logic.

72
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.230
And so this is why I think it's better to tap into unity versus doing sort of daydream cardboard stuff

73
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.230
on your own natively with Android.

74
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.200
I think this is just a little bit more user friendly slash you can get up and running much faster.

75
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.430
Now the main key point in that we've got to do to move forward here is you've got to import that Google

76
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.350
SDK stuff into here.

77
00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:03.290
So we're going to go to assets import new asset and we're going to go to our downloads and I'm going

78
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.090
to select.

79
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.270
I'm in the wrong place here.

80
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.380
So I want to go to assets import packages what I want and I want a custom package and I want this unity

81
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.330
package.

82
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.160
This you know Google V.R. for unity blah blah blah.

83
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.990
So you make sure you have that unity package if you don't have that file that means you downloaded something

84
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.740
incorrectly it wasn't the right way and maybe you got you know Google V.R. for just Android or you got

85
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.930
it for iOS right.

86
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.310
So we want the one that was for unity.

87
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.560
But soon you have one go ahead and hit open.

88
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.410
So I'm going to ask you what part it is that you want to import and I just want to you know take everything

89
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.040
and hit this button that says all that clicks everything will just go ahead and hit important.

90
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.040
So once we do this it's going to bring it down here an asset.

91
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.830
There's all sorts of different configurations that you can work with here in order to get your app up

92
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.380
and running.

93
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.470
But Google has an awesome demo project to sorta just shows you the basics of what's going on.

94
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.660
So we're going to open up as Google V.R. and we're going to move into demos.

95
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.160
And with that we're going to move into the folder called scene so this contains all the examples.

96
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.130
Here's the one that we want to look at is this G.V. our demo I think GVR is short for Google virtual

97
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.410
reality so anywhere you see GVR I know that that's sort of the acronym that it's got there.

98
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.580
So this opens up.

99
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:31.610
This is a sample little thing that puts us here inside of a room and you can see this camera.

100
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.940
This represents the user the player in their headset.

101
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.400
And there's going to be some boxes that are going to be showing up inside of this game.

102
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.790
But in order to get this to run there's a few things that we've got to do.

103
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.380
So the first one is we want to search for settings and we want to go first to build settings.

104
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:58.170
So in build settings go in select Android here just go ahead and select that and we want to switch platform.

105
00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.590
All right.

106
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.080
And that'll take a second to get everything up and running but we want to have this be the thing that

107
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.030
we're building for so when you build something in unity it's kind of making a you know a current version

108
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.670
of you happens whenever we test something and emulate it right.

109
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:16.670
So luckily we can just test it here without throwing it on an actual device that just adds another layer

110
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.020
of complexity you're going to want to do that when you're ready to you know publish your app and check

111
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.350
it out.

112
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.920
But for now I'll just have that so if you have this yodeled unity logo that means you're good to go.

113
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.930
And we can go ahead and X out of this.

114
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.920
The next thing that we need to do is we need to search for settings and we want to go now to project

115
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.380
settings.

116
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.970
So with project settings Oh here we go.

117
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.320
So inside of project settings we want to go down to player and there's a couple of options here.

118
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.120
But the main one that we want to check down here.

119
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:53.750
So we want to go down to X our settings and we want to do virtual reality support and so make sure you

120
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.520
have that box checked.

121
00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.530
Also make sure that you hit the little plus button here and you say I'm building this for cardboard

122
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:06.800
or I'm building this for daydream or whatnot so I'm going to select cardboard here for example.

123
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:14.240
And once that's in place we should be able to hit this plus button and this will run our little example.

124
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.870
So the real key with this is in order.

125
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.940
You might be clicking on try to move around you can't do anything.

126
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.430
The real key is you hold down the key on your keyboard and then as you move your mouse you're suddenly

127
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:31.610
now in this world and you'll see when you hover over this this is simulating if you had a device on

128
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.210
your head and you were able to select something.

129
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.140
But we'd go ahead and you know for example if we click on this box it makes it disappear and oh look

130
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.330
there's one over there and we can click and it looks like this one is close to us those little dots

131
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.730
floating out of the thing.

132
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.980
But this one's up above so you can see that's that.

133
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.310
All right.

134
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.000
So we're in that little room.

135
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.410
We'll go ahead and hit the play button to stop that.

136
00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:03.050
Now this is sort of the point where you have to understand unity to sort of move forward and make things

137
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.890
so I'll show you kind of a very simple example.

138
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:11.860
If we go up here to a game object and we do 3-D objects I could bring in something like a cube.

139
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.610
So if I bring in a cube all sudden I have this cube that if I use these little colored things I can

140
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.730
decide where the cube is going to go.

141
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.430
Other things that I can bring inside of there.

142
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.170
I could bring a sphere and I can decide where I want this to go.

143
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:32.910
So I'm for example just going to add these two objects and I'm now going to run this and you'll notice

144
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.100
now there's this box behind this other one right.

145
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.210
Like if I get rid of that there's still the cube there and look to my right.

146
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.020
Oh my goodness there's a sphere.

147
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:46.150
Now these aren't programmed to do the cool thing like they disappear when you click on it but I'm just

148
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.050
showing you that you know this is how you could edit and make a 3D world.

149
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.080
And it's just really outside of the scope of this class.

150
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.190
There's whole there's awesome great courses on unity about how it works and getting it all set up.

151
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:04.420
So the awesome thing for you is if you want to dive further with virtual reality and daydream here Google

152
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.520
cardboard whatever it is that you'd like.

153
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.390
You just have to learn how to use unity and whatever skills you learn in unity.

154
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:17.140
They don't have to just be for virtual reality with Android you can use them to make a 3-D PC game you

155
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:23.680
can use it to make iPhone or Android games that don't necessarily use VR like any 3D world.

156
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.170
You can sort of adapt it to go to different platforms.

157
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.380
That's the real beauty of unity.

158
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:34.810
And over here you can see all the stuff on the left like GVR instant preview DVR headset right.

159
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.210
Like that's our little player that's being controlled and whatnot.

160
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.760
And so when you make your own world you're going to want to bring one of these guys in and all this

161
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.030
different stuff.

162
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.690
But this is where I'm going to leave you at this point.

163
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.800
I wanted to get you to a starting point where you could at least test this out and again if you wanted

164
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.830
to put this on your device.

165
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.160
There's great tutorials about plugging it in and get it running but like I said with daydream you've

166
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.420
really got to have an advanced enough device to handle all the hardware requirements.

167
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:07.230
So hopefully you enjoyed that and can make a cool virtual world.
