1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.470
So when the previous video were built in some basic interactivity into our app.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.950
But we know today that it's not very interactive because we can't get any data from the user other than

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.260
the fact that they've pressed the button.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.110
So in this video we're going to add a text field and see how we can get the data within that text field

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.480
and do something with it when the button is pressed.

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.730
All right.

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.660
So let's go back over to our lay out.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.070
Get rid of the log for the moment.

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.950
And see you in a little.

10
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:44.630
In fact we'll get rid of that bit over there because we don't need it and we're going to click on text

11
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.120
and bring in a plain text element and I'll just pop it above the button there.

12
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.800
And there we go.

13
00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:04.160
You can see it takes the default Android style so fast I'll make it full width by changing the width

14
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:19.760
to match constraint and then add in some small margins on the left and the right and I'll just add a

15
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.840
third margin linking it to the button so that it's well laid out and we're going to need to be able

16
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.970
to refer to this UI elements in our code to know what its value is.

17
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.960
So we're going to look at for the first time the id attribute and each element here has an ID.

18
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.840
If we look at the button that ID is just button and the ID of the text field here is added text which

19
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.830
is the name that we use for a text field in Android development.

20
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.010
So just to customize that little bit we're taking the name of the person here.

21
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.580
So I'm going to call this name added text.

22
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.850
If you haven't come across this capitalization before this is known as camel case where the first word

23
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.610
is completely lowercase and then every word after that is capitalized and it's just a nice way to keep

24
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.250
it completely text based no spaces but make it reasonably readable for human viewers.

25
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.950
And just one other thing to show you about added texts before we go and write some code is that we can

26
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.520
add a hint which is very useful.

27
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.390
So if we want to use his name for example we might say your name and that is a hint and then if we get

28
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:47.370
rid of the text name then that will display that and then run the app correctly and see how that behaves.

29
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.960
We should find that your name appears faintly and then when we tap in the field and start writing some

30
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.570
text it disappears completely.

31
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.820
So you've probably seen that behavior either on apps on Web sites.

32
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.780
It's a very useful way to interact.

33
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.630
So you can see it's clear we're asking for the name but as soon as we start typing the hint goes away.

34
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.530
Brenham.

35
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.210
So we've created an edit text with an ID of name added text and we want to get its value when the button

36
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.940
is pressed and display it in the logs.

37
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.690
So a few new things to learn.

38
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.260
The first is that we need to create an edit text variable to refer to our name added text that we've

39
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.210
just created.

40
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:47.020
So this variable has a type of added text so it's added text with a capital H and I'll call it name

41
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.830
edit text.

42
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.730
We need to add the added text class of the top then

43
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.340
and it's going to be equal to this particular view or the text field.

44
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:16.190
And the way that we find that view is we use the method find view by id and then the ID we know is name

45
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:24.620
edit text but we don't just enter name added text we use our resources dot ID for our set of resources

46
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:33.950
and then within that we use our particular ID so name added text and then we end with a semicolon.

47
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:43.310
We're not quite done because this find view by id method will return a view and we want an edit text

48
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.570
which is a particular type of.

49
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:54.320
So we have to convert the view that is returned by this method into an edit text and we do that by adding

50
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.820
edit text in brackets before they find view.

51
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.850
By id method.

52
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:10.670
So this will create a variable of type added text with a name of name added text and it will find a

53
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.340
view by its ID.

54
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:20.210
The ID is invisible says on the set of IDS within our app and name it it text is the actual ID and then

55
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.810
it will convert that into an added text and set the name added text variable equal to that makes sense.

56
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.210
Excellent.

57
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.410
If you are not 100 percent don't worry it will become clearer as you practice it.

58
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.230
OK so then we're going to add a second line to the logs.

59
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:50.560
And this one is going to have a tag of values because it's going to be a valley.

60
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.130
And the actual thing we want to log is the value of the name.

61
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:07.900
Edit text say the text within it and we get that using name as a text dot get text.

62
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.920
And then we need an extra function to convert it to a string so that we can display it in the logs.

63
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.030
So this finds the edit text it gets the text within it and then they convert it to a string which is

64
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.130
just a set of characters and displays it in the logs.

65
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.430
All right here we go.

66
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.640
Let's run it and see if it behaves as we want.

67
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.210
OK so first off if I just press the button when it's empty

68
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.510
you'll see we just get it worked because there's no value

69
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.210
in the text.

70
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:08.300
But if we write up and then press the button you can see we get it worked.

71
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.340
And then Rob great.

72
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.580
So that's how we get the value of a particular field as before.

73
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.340
I want you to try this out and I want the creation of a new app to be second nature for you as well.

74
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:31.900
So I'd like you to create a simple log in screen so it should ask using text fields for a username and

75
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.860
password and then the button should say log in.

76
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.320
And then when you click the log in button in the logs we want to see the username and password that

77
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.510
the user has entered.

78
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.920
All right that's the challenge.

79
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.850
Good luck.

80
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.050
Go for it.

81
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.310
All right.

82
00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:02.050
Well I'm going to see clays this project and start a new one.

83
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.700
I'll call it loggin demo.

84
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:15.290
And because we're old pros at this now I can just click next next next and let androids to do its thing.

85
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:23.980
So we want to get the user name and password from the user so we need to edit texts and then a single

86
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.870
button underneath

87
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.310
to allow the user to log in.

88
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.200
So let's get rid of I'll text you then.

89
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.600
And bring in plain text.

90
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:50.200
Now we do have some other types of text fields so we could use an email one if we like but I'm going

91
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.260
to stick with plain text as we're going for it use a name rather than password.

92
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.920
So let's set up text.

93
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.650
So we're going from top to bottom use and aim at it text is what we'll call it.

94
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:15.780
And actually we need to jump to lay out with match constraint and then I'll add the left.

95
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.690
So we've got 16 there that's quite a nice margin from the edge.

96
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.670
So we'll have 16 on the other side as well.

97
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:32.790
And we will get rid of the name text and I'll just change the hint to

98
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.400
use a name.

99
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.340
Every guy can have a look at the input types.

100
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.510
There isn't a user name option.

101
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.890
So I think I'll leave it as it's just a plain text.

102
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.920
But for the next one we want a password so let's use the password field.

103
00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:02.070
And if you did that yourself then give yourself some bonus points so this will have the effect of not

104
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.310
showing the actual characters when he uses them but just showing little blobs instead.

105
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:15.870
As before we change the password width to match constraint and then we'll add in

106
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.900
some margins.

107
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.410
So you can see the default ID for this one is added text 2.

108
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.680
I'm going to change that to password at it.

109
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:36.260
TEXT And we'll have a hint which will just be password

110
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.790
great.

111
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.370
Let's not forget a top margin for these.

112
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.000
So the layout is clear.

113
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.660
And then we'll bring in our button

114
00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:11.320
which I'll send to adding three margins and I'll change the text from button to log in and change the

115
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.800
ID to logon button.

116
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.600
All right.

117
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.650
OK.

118
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.360
So we're all done there apart from the on click method.

119
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.270
I'll come back and do that when I've defined it over here in main activity Java right.

120
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.090
Third time we've done this now so it should be reasonably clear in your mind.

121
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.990
We're creating a public method doesn't return anything.

122
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:44.600
So it's void and I'll call it loggin this time because that's what we want it to at least appear to

123
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:54.970
the user that we're doing the method receives a variable of type view which we'll call V which will

124
00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:06.940
be the button that calls it and then lets first off just do a simple log and I'll show you why I do

125
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.400
that in a minute.

126
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.220
So in fact.

127
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.710
And then button pressed.

128
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.490
And I think this is a good thing to do just to make sure that everything is connected up right before

129
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.050
you right sort of any complicated carryed.

130
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:32.030
Just make sure that your button is linked up to your code like that.

131
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.090
And that if there's a problem it's not because your code doesn't work.

132
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.580
Because your code is so simple it can't possibly not work.

133
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.850
So it's worth just doing a quick check at this point and then will write the code to get the value of

134
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.730
the user name had the password.

135
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:53.240
So here we go.

136
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.340
All looks good.

137
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.400
Let's just tap the log in button and check the logs.

138
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.220
There we go.

139
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.740
That's looking good.

140
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.540
Yep.

141
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.180
So all is linked up right.

142
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:13.660
We just need to get the values of the user name and password fields so again hopefully you remember

143
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:23.350
we create a variable of type edit text that it takes class.

144
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:33.840
Let's call this name edit text and we're going to get this using find view by id and the ID is resources

145
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.950
ID dot use a name and a text

146
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:50.710
and we want to convert that to an added text from just a general view.

147
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.380
Same with password.

148
00:13:53.370 --> 00:14:00.760
Added text I would get into the habit of literally as you're typing these things to be talking it through

149
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.830
in the same way I am to say what the actual lines of code are doing.

150
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:17.470
So we're finding a view by its ID the ID as resources Id use a name at it text and then we're converting

151
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.390
that to an added text.

152
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.690
Excellent name would just add in two lines for the logs.

153
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.230
So this is going to be the user name

154
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:48.690
we won't use and aim at it text don't get text dot to string that we have to predict to say good.

155
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:53.870
You can almost get away without typing anything in there.

156
00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:07.590
We'll have the password which is password it text or get text dot to stry.

157
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.540
There we go.

158
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:09.950
I should do it.

159
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.410
Well press it again.

160
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:17.510
That little dot by the way means that it's going to run the app without completely re-installing it

161
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.070
which is supposed to be a bit quicker.

162
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.560
I haven't noticed it.

163
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.140
Super quick but there you go.

164
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.530
That's not too bad.

165
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:32.730
So again if there's no value we don't get anything logged.

166
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:41.180
But if I put in my username and password is my password and then press log in

167
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.030
there we go.

168
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.010
The button was pressed

169
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.700
ha.

170
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.760
And can you see what mistake I made there.

171
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:58.550
Hopefully you noticed at the time I thought I'll leave this mistake in.

172
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.820
We all make mistakes.

173
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:08.310
The important thing is that we figure out there there or we release OK to the world.

174
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.680
I should have been password added text not user name added text.

175
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.360
All right let's try that again Rob.

176
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.990
And password log in.

177
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.800
There we go.

178
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.980
That's better.

179
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.610
All right.

180
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.420
Hopefully you manage to do that without making an awful mistake.

181
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:35.880
But we're now able to make a more interactive app but that's probably part of you thinking but this

182
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:42.840
isn't really interactive because the user can't see any of this log content that we've created down

183
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.110
here.

184
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.910
So we really need to display something for the users so that they know that they've logged in or that

185
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.540
we've really registered the button click.

186
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.130
And that's exactly what will they in the next video.
