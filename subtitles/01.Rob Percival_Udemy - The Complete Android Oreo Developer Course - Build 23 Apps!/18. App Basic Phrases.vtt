00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.510
Welcome to the last video in Section 4 in this video we're going to be making a nice useful but fairly

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:14.040
simple basic phrases app which we're going to build on the structure that we created in the previous

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.830
video.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.240
So it's a simple English to French app.

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.340
And if you tap on the buttons

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.260
you get the basic phrase that you need.

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.910
So nice and simple but actually quite functional and useful.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.670
The one challenge you'll have is trying to combine these into a single method rather than having a separate

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.060
method for each button having a single method and then having a way to play whichever sound relates

10
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.490
to the button that the user tapped tapetum.

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.730
So that's the challenge here.

12
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.750
But to get your actual phrases you have two options.

13
00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.850
So I've got my phrases from languages dot com and I've used the French and B-3 and they've got a huge

14
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.100
range of completely free MP 3s so you can customize your app as you like.

15
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.950
You can use a different language if you want but if you want the super easy version where you don't

16
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:23.360
have to manually download each phrase you can just go to Android dev cause dot com forward slash phrases

17
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.670
dot zip and that will download the phrases that I use in this app.

18
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.740
So you've got them all in one go.

19
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.420
All right.

20
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.280
You should definitely be able to build this app.

21
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.250
So time to post the video and give it a shot.

22
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.020
Best of luck.

23
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.060
All right.

24
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.650
I hope that went well.

25
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.930
I'm going to start by bringing in

26
00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:04.470
the sounds into the hours also follow up which all day in the usual way by opening the folder in Finder

27
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.760
or Windows Explorer and then creating a new folder.

28
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.610
Rule and I'm just going to drag

29
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.110
the phrases directly in to the roar folder.

30
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.420
Now they're all fantastic.

31
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.930
Now as I mentioned the challenge is going to be setting this up with a single method works regardless

32
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.710
of which button has been pressed and it plays the appropriate sound or Fridays.

33
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.960
And as you hopefully guessed I'm going to do that with tags.

34
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.970
So I'm going to update each button as we go and I'll just work my way down the list.

35
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.470
So do you

36
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.180
speak English.

37
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.490
And then the tag

38
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.720
is going to be the name of the file.

39
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.810
So do you speak English.

40
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.750
And then I can use the tag directly to access the file.

41
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.140
All right.

42
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.700
Here we go.

43
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.970
Good evening.

44
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.840
Just copy the

45
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.710
case for the tag

46
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.520
or while we're going.

47
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.950
I'll update the id the update.

48
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.250
The IDs aren't particularly important so I'm just going to use.

49
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.770
Button one button to etc..

50
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.900
Then we've got Halet that perhaps should have been at the beginning but you can move them around yourself

51
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.260
if you like.

52
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.420
I will leave this in info.

53
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.890
But feel free to skip forward 30 seconds I'll say if you get the idea or just do this along with me

54
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.650
in our on button five

55
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.080
Hi live in

56
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.000
button 6

57
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.040
my name I'll keep pasting caps

58
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.810
nearly there.

59
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.920
Please it doesn't make much difference.

60
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.730
But just to keep it all in the same style stick to Kappes

61
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.230
and there we go.

62
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.530
So you got a bit of an issue there with.

63
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.430
Do you speak English as being a bit greedy with space.

64
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.060
So let's see if we can

65
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.210
use a new line to even that out.

66
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:08.550
Let me guess the backslash and gives you a new line which should keep everything nicely aligned.

67
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.480
So now it's just a matter of adding an on click to each of these playing the name of the file that's

68
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.630
in the tag let's give it a go.

69
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.900
So will the on click

70
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.480
like then

71
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:45.880
I might be editing something fancy with find and replace but I think it's quicker here just to pasted

72
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:58.270
in each time and then we're just going to jump over to our Java file and create the play Euphrase method.

73
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.030
All right.

74
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:05.040
So I'll just run the app in the background so I was waiting for it later on.

75
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:12.440
And then create play phrase.

76
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:21.640
And initially all L.D. with the method is log the tag of the button that's been pressed that should

77
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.110
be enough I'm fairly confident that we'll get that far.

78
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.200
So it will have a button pressed

79
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:42.520
variable which will cast the button and get from the few.

80
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:43.900
And then we'll log

81
00:07:50.260 --> 00:08:02.900
button pressed and then will access button pressed to get tag and then convert that to a string

82
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.210
OK.

83
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.210
Let's have a look.

84
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.300
So the louts looking at happy with that.

85
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.150
So let's just press a few of these buttons

86
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.690
and this is looking at

87
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.460
wonderful.

88
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:34.220
So all we have to do is play the audio file associated with the tag.

89
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.300
However it's not quite as simple as you might think.

90
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.070
If we try and create our media player

91
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.590
we'll use we have before so Media Player create.

92
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:59.730
Now before we used our DOT roll and then we just use the name of the audio file.

93
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.180
Nice and easy but we actually want to use a variable here i.e. the value of the tag.

94
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.760
And if we try and use something like button pressed to get a tag it won't work because it's expecting

95
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:17.140
the name of the RAW file directly.

96
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:23.980
So we're going to need to find a way round this so that we can use our variable name to play the file.

97
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:30.200
So that's consult Google and see if we can find a solution.

98
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:41.430
So we want something like Java Android play sound file with variable something like that.

99
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.550
OK that top result sound file is variable in Android media play.

100
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.020
Ok that looks promising.

101
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:57.110
Looks like they want to do what we want today and that looks perfect.

102
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:05.180
So the difference is here we're using media player to create and then this for the context and then

103
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.250
get resources.

104
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:16.090
And this is where we're using the name of the file which we can put in as our tag.

105
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.600
Excellent.

106
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.020
So let's copy over.

107
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.380
I generally recommend copying over as little as possible

108
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:31.030
little as possible chance of either getting confused or copying code that's wrong or doesn't do what

109
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.510
you expect.

110
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:39.750
So the thing we need to change the name of the file and that is just button pressed.

111
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.960
Get a tag dot to string

112
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.970
and it's type of roll and it's going to be in our package.

113
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.750
All right.

114
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.990
Let's give it a try.

115
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:07.960
So Media Player don't start should With any luck do the trick.

116
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.280
Let's give it a go.

117
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.930
There you go.

118
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.880
Excellent.

119
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.790
So that's created our basic phrases have and worked in the way we wanted it to.

120
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.070
And it also brings us to the end of this section where you've learned how to work with animations.

121
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:47.860
Build a fairly complicated connect three game and include all audio and video in your apps and work

122
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.600
with tags to create a basic phrases app.

123
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.300
So as always congratulations go get yourself a cup of tea and a biscuit.

124
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.540
Give yourself a pat on the back.

125
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.810
But don't get too complacent because there's still a huge amount more to learn.

126
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.380
We're going to be looking at list views at the beginning of the next section to enable you to show a

127
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:12.580
whole long list of data and movie making apps like egg timers brain trainers and internet connected

128
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.660
apps like guess the celebrity and what's the weather.

129
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.760
So a huge amount more to learn see in the next section.
