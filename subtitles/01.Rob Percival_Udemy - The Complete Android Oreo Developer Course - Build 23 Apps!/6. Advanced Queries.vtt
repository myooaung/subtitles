00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.190
In this lecture we're going to learn a little bit more about queering we're going to do some advanced

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.300
stuff with that and we're going to be working with the score class here.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.440
So right now we have two objects in there.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.190
You know let's say we wanted to grab more than just one person score like we wanted to grab everybody's

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.810
score.

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.850
How could we do that.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.090
Well let's go ahead and move back to android studio and we have got a lot of code here with all these

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.340
different examples that we did so I'm going to go ahead and clear that out so that we have a start fresh

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.650
start here to move forward.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.250
So how can we make it so that we grab all the score objects.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.290
Well we are going to create a parce queery.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.930
And with this again set our angle brackets we are looking for a parse object or parse object boum.

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.370
So I'm just going to call this lowercase queery.

14
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.020
We're going to say this is equal to parse query dot get queery.

15
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.230
And again we are looking for the score class.

16
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.080
Now this is where things take a turn.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:09.170
So before when we said queery dot and we wanted to do you know our find in background.

18
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.240
So with this we were putting before.

19
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.280
See here let's make sure you find the background we were putting in first the ID of that particular

20
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.370
object and then we were doing you know the new find callback.

21
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.470
But in this situation we're not looking for a particular ID we want everything and so now we are just

22
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.460
going to say new are going to do capital find callback.

23
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.500
And with this we are going to type out here if we put in parentheses here we just want to check and

24
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.230
make sure we're actually got some objects and I guess I should take a second to mention here.

25
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.980
Look at this.

26
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.060
We are getting back a list of park parse objects and the situation writes Not one singular object so

27
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.420
that's pretty important here.

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.270
So we want to make sure that we didn't have any errors with this situation so we're going to first check

29
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.280
and see if e is equal to no.

30
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.940
So if it's not that means that we're probably safe to move forward.

31
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.690
Next thing that we want to check and see is if there's actual objects inside of the objects list so

32
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.260
we're going to do another if statement or to say if objects dot and we want to get the size right to

33
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.480
say if this is greater than zero then we're able to move forward and no.

34
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.890
All right we've got some objects and work with them.

35
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.630
So if that is the case then let's go ahead and do a for loop through these objects.

36
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.890
So we're going to say four and we just want to say capital parse object that we'll call a singular object.

37
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.110
Notice no s.

38
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.450
So we're gonna have singular object Colan objects with an S So it's going to loop through and each time

39
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.890
it goes to a particular object it will name it object.

40
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.870
And then we can go ahead and get some information about.

41
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.680
So let's go ahead and just log out information about the score object so the first thing that we should

42
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.600
probably get is the user name.

43
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.780
So we're going to say user name here and what we're going to do for the string is we need to get access

44
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.730
to the object not get string.

45
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.120
And the key that we're going to pass in here is username because we want to get their username and we'll

46
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.830
do something similar for the score although with the score it's an integer.

47
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.240
We're going to have to do some conversion there but we're going to say we're looking for the score we

48
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.320
want to get the score but I guess you know let's just retype this because we want to say get in it for

49
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:56.250
the score and we're going to have to convert that so we'll do our capital integer to string and let's

50
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.150
make sure we put object back in there and then want to add an additional parentheses.

51
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.340
So that should log out that information.

52
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.910
OK.

53
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:12.580
So don't forget we need to have a semi-colon down here to wrap up this new find in background.

54
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:20.310
And we seem to have somehow lost and in parentheses here so we'll go ahead and put that in.

55
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.920
That should make things happy so if this works out we should be able to log out to users and their scores

56
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.570
with this one particular query.

57
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.620
So let's go ahead and run this

58
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.170
write emulator here and then open up Blog that.

59
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.560
All right so it opens up and look at that.

60
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:54.320
We print out Nick 45 Shonn 85 so it successfully went to parse and got each of the objects so you see

61
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.570
we're not just getting one object by its particular ID.

62
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.540
We're now listing through a bunch of objects and getting access to each of them.

63
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.600
So now that you know how to do this the next thing that we want to do is move forward and talk about

64
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.960
how we can then search for a particular object.

65
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.620
So you know maybe we're getting the list but we only want to know people who name starts with this or

66
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.870
you know their scores are higher than something like that right.

67
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.540
So before we do the query so we're going to type up here.

68
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.980
We want to set some additional parameters so you can say query where and you'll notice if you type where

69
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.170
there's all sorts of different options here.

70
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.060
But the one that we're looking for is where equal to.

71
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.200
And if we do this we want to say you know we want to know where there is usernames.

72
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.660
Let me make sure that it's lower case user name you've got to spell that correctly.

73
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.940
So where the lowercase username is equal to.

74
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.760
And let's pick one of the users names so maybe let's go with Sean here.

75
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.430
So we'll come back and say give us all the people who have the name Sean then with that we have to then

76
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.820
specify here you don't have to do this but I think it's probably a good healthy thing.

77
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.870
You know let's say there were multiple Shan's you might get back a bunch of objects which maybe that's

78
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.950
what you want but also you maybe want to limit that to only one shot.

79
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.660
So if you can say Get limit is equal to 1.

80
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.230
Excuse me get limit.

81
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:30.950
We want to set the limit and we might set that equal to 1 to say hey we only want to get one result

82
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.230
back from that we still need to loop through because we're still getting the list.

83
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.640
But that kind of says hey we only want one and it doesn't have to be one.

84
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.740
Let's maybe you know if we wanted five Sean objects we could have put a you know an option of five but

85
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.120
it's really up to you about how you handle that.

86
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.140
So go ahead and hit run.

87
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.980
Let's make sure we're getting the correct information here.

88
00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:01.380
And it's go ahead and open up log cat if we scroll look at that we get Sean 85 and Nick is nowhere to

89
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.950
be seen.

90
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.410
So that's great.

91
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.740
Now I have a challenge for you and the challenge is as follows So let's go ahead and clear all this

92
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.920
out.

93
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.960
We want to start fresh here.

94
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:20.130
The challenge for you is I want you to make it so that you go through all of these score objects and

95
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:27.990
say hey as long as someone has a score higher than 50 I want you to give them an additional 20 points

96
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.980
so you can see one person is above.

97
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.280
One is not above 50.

98
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.190
So if the user is above 50 points I want you to add 20 to their score.

99
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.750
OK.

100
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:46.110
Go ahead and hit pause to do that now all right so hopefully that went well for you again.

101
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.060
Wanted you to go through all the score objects find people who have a score greater than 50 add 20 to

102
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.680
it.

103
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:57.570
So we are going to make a parse query just like we did before.

104
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:04.200
We're looking for PARSE objects and we'll just go ahead and call this query it is going to be equal

105
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.810
to none.

106
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:13.110
And we just want to say parse queery dot get query and we are looking for a score objects.

107
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.980
And then we have to specify the query that you know hey we only want scores that are greater than 50.

108
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.840
So you remember when I said with these where's there's all sorts of options so we're going to search

109
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.540
for where greater than and you know I haven't particularly taught you this so this is where you know

110
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.980
hopefully you found this via google or just trying things out on your own.

111
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.780
But we're going to say where a greater than and we're going to specify first the key score and then

112
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.770
the value of 50 or saying where the score is greater than 50.

113
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.640
So now that we have that sort of parameter in place saying you know we only want those people we can

114
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.290
now take our queery and do a find in background k.

115
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:03.640
And what this find in background we want to do a new find callback just like this.

116
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.860
So this gives us back the list.

117
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:12.030
Let's go ahead and do a combined if statement here for checking for e being equal to no.

118
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:20.610
And also we'll go ahead and we'll do the Ampere's stamps here to say and let's make sure that objects

119
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.710
is not equal to no.

120
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.100
So if that's the case then we know we can safely do a for loop through these objects so we're going

121
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:35.660
to say four and we'll just make a parse object that we'll call object.

122
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.280
I mean you could if you wanted to be a little more specific here and you could say this is a score.

123
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.620
I might just do that for fun so that you know you can see that there's nothing special about that name

124
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.050
object and in this case it might make it easier to read.

125
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:56.460
So with this let's go ahead and you know add additional points to the score so we're going to take the

126
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.140
score object dot put.

127
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.380
And the key that we're trying to update is score and remember we want to add 20 to their score so we

128
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.740
need to take the existing score and add 22.

129
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:16.420
So in order to get that existing score we're going to take our score object get it for the score key.

130
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.670
We're going to take that and add 20 on to it.

131
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.010
So we're taking what's already there adding 20 onto it and putting that in this new score object.

132
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.150
Now we're going to say score thought save in background.

133
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:29.620
Boom.

134
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.210
That is the code we need.

135
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.450
So let's go ahead and run this.

136
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.190
Make sure that it works correctly.

137
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.900
We have talked the talk let's make sure we can walk the walk or wait for the app to open up there.

138
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.040
It looks like it's done it's stuff we didn't log anything so we won't see anything here in Lague cab.

139
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:54.610
But if we go up here we should see that Sean who has a score greater than 50 should bump up to 105.

140
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.930
But Nick who has a score less than 50.

141
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.080
Nothing should happen to him.

142
00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.910
So we'll go ahead and reload here.

143
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.660
Boom.

144
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.570
Look at that because he had a score greater than 50.

145
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.090
He updated with 20 points.

146
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.690
So now you know how to update that.

147
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.050
Now in the next lecture we're going to be talking about the user or this is something we want to make

148
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.720
sure we really grasp and understand before we move on to making that Instagram Instagram app so let's

149
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.490
go ahead and dive into that now.
