00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.840
All right I hope you're excited to start building some of our core technology with me.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.140
A-R just kind of blows my mind.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.130
I mean the idea that we can take our physical world our digital world and sort of meld the two of them

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.600
just amazing to me.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.170
So I highly recommend checking out Google's Web site for this developers dog Google dot com slash are

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.080
all sorts of information about how you can start working with a market.

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.510
And there's really these three launching pads you can go with Android studio unity or unreal so both

8
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.820
unity and unreal these are game engines and so for the 3D world of things if you're going to get really

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.110
specific there I highly recommend going with unity in unreal but in the daydream section we covered

10
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.420
how to work with Unity's so I'm going to kind of leave both the game engines off for this one instead.

11
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.140
Show you how you could get up and running with Android studio versus using one of these game engines.

12
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.820
Also no there's some great resources down here about I think particularly the API is and the guides

13
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.680
are where you're going to want to be looking and obviously any questions you have the forms are a good

14
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.980
place.

15
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.530
But we're going to go ahead and learn how to get started with an android studio path to doing our course

16
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.610
so we're going to go ahead and click on get started.

17
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.960
And the first sort of devastating news that we have to encounter is there's only a few supported Android

18
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.870
devices and you need a physical Android device.

19
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.130
So not only do you need a physical Android device but you'd need a Either Google pixel pixel like cell

20
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.190
pixel to pixel to x l or X galaxy 8.

21
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.100
Now that's only at the time of filming.

22
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.180
There may be more phones that come out with time and that support our core but this is a very limited

23
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.280
set of phones.

24
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.990
And these are all pretty expensive phones.

25
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.630
But like I said over time I think this is going to come down you may be watching this and be like Google

26
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.100
pics so I can totally for that or pixel to it's nothing but.

27
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.700
So just know you're not going to be able to test it out.

28
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.130
I have a pixel to here that I got so that we could test this out so you could see what it looks like

29
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.260
but just wanted to get clear enough with all of this.

30
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.590
Also I love this little example pictured that they included here like one of these hippos with no legs

31
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.840
or like blobby hippos slash bunnies.

32
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.260
I'm not sure what's going on but kind of cool thing there.

33
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.990
So anyways let's go ahead and work through these steps.

34
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.790
We do have Android studio.

35
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.050
We have a supported device here.

36
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.030
The next thing that we need to do is we need to download this SDK preview for Android studio.

37
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.280
So we're going to go ahead and click on this file which will start a download case so this is going

38
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.660
to we now have this file in our downloads are going to go ahead and throw that on my desktop.

39
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.310
So I'm going to go open up this folder bring it to my desktop and inside of here there is inside of

40
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.440
sample's this Java core.

41
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.050
Hello.

42
00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.850
They.

43
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.370
So this is the project that we want to open.

44
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.840
So let's go ahead and go to Android studio.

45
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.950
We're going to say open an existing project I'm just going to go to my desktop and here inside of sample's

46
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.190
I want to say like Java our core.

47
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.250
Hello our So go ahead and say open to that.

48
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.530
And there's going to be a few things that you'll probably have to update.

49
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.460
So when I was working on this I just sort of said yes to everything to get up to the most current version

50
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.420
and it worked out for me so I'm going to do this as well.

51
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.610
And of course these files can change with time.

52
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.500
I mean our core is technically still in Preview although it hasn't been quite developed.

53
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.910
I have a friend who's been in a car for a couple of years now.

54
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.580
Before Android came out with our core before iOS came out to our kit he was doing it more with these

55
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.600
kind of private libraries.

56
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.890
But anyways I asked him about our core and he said yes it is in Preview but it is very functional and

57
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.420
in fact he said in many ways I sometimes see it beating a market and a lot of different areas.

58
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.850
So that was pretty cool to hear.

59
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.390
So with this here we're almost ready to get started but there's a pretty big crucial piece here and

60
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.850
this is the really confusing part.

61
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.810
So this is where I want to make sure I'm here for you and that's whatever device it is that you're using.

62
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.830
You want to make sure that it's able to run on there.

63
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.430
And there's a few tricky things that we have to do.

64
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.220
So the very first one and I'm going to go ahead and get my app up here my phone so you can see what's

65
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:42.430
going on we need to see here and open up this app called vizor you saw this before but this is going

66
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.190
to allow us to see my device.

67
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.900
Excellent.

68
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.160
So the first thing that we want to do is we want to go to our settings.

69
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.810
So I'm going to go ahead and open up my settings and you want to scroll all the way down to the bottom

70
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:06.630
two system and you want to go down to about pixel and scroll all the way down and double tap or quadruple

71
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.650
tap whatever it is you keep tapping on this until it says Hey congratulations you are a developer and

72
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.110
once you have that in place the next step is you have to enable us be debugging and I'll be honest this

73
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.760
is kind of hard to find.

74
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.820
So I just would go to the settings and search for USP and then us be the bugginess going to come up

75
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.830
here and you can go ahead and switch this on.

76
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.730
I didn't have vizor on the whole time that I was doing that.

77
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:40.560
So you want to go to the search in your settings search for us be just go to US be the buggy and set

78
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.190
this switch to ON.

79
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.660
OK.

80
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.070
So that's kind of your first step there.

81
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:53.160
Then the next thing is we have to get this A-R core services installed on our phone and we have to do

82
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.550
it through a db.

83
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.410
And so this is going to be using the terminal on your computer.

84
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.210
And so this is going to be a little bit tricky here but step number one we need to download this file

85
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.820
so go ahead and click here.

86
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.320
It's going to start downloading that that might take a little bit of time but that's OK because it's

87
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.460
going to take a while in order to get this up and running.

88
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:20.130
So if you're not familiar with the terminal or the command prompt if you're on the PC here's it's basically

89
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.230
allows you to move through your computer but just via a text based system rather than a visual system

90
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.490
you'll see here with like a mouse in windows and stuff like that.

91
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:34.620
So what we're going to do is it looks like that file has finished downloading.

92
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:41.400
I'm going to go ahead and throw that on my desktop and I'll just put that there are court preview.

93
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.630
AP case will essentially we're trying to get this AP K on to our phone.

94
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.750
So on a Mac I'm going to open up the terminal for you on a PC.

95
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:58.290
You want to open up the command prompt but we want to find out where our SDK tools are installed with

96
00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.740
our Android studio.

97
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:09.300
And so if you go to Android studio and you check out the preferences you can go ahead and go into appearance

98
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.530
and behavior then go to system settings and Android SDK.

99
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.890
So this is going to show you where your SDK is installed.

100
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:22.820
So for me flash users slash that decodes slash library slash Android slash SDK.

101
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:29.450
So in our terminal here we want to move in to that directory so to do that we're going to do CD which

102
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:36.420
is changed directory and space then I'm going to go copy this complete path and then I'm going to paste

103
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.810
it into my terminal and hit enter.

104
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.120
So if he see as he came over here this now means you've moved into this directory folder.

105
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.700
If I type.

106
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.680
LS That's going to list out everything in that folder.

107
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.540
And we're trying to get here into our platform tools.

108
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:58.980
So we're going to go ahead and say see the plat form ash tools.

109
00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.810
OK.

110
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:06.970
And if you do an ls here if you see an APB this tells you OK for sure you are ready to rock n roll.

111
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.220
And basically what we just need to do is we need this to go ahead and open our app.

112
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.960
So this is a great stopping point in the next one I'm going to show you how to finish installing this

113
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.250
on your phone.

114
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.610
And then we're going to move on to checking out our core.
