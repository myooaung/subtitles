1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:00,820
All right.

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,260
So we were able to successfully go find some information about when we started searching.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,050
When we finished but now let's go ahead and write some code so for when we actually get information

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,520
back saying hey we found a bluetooth device how do we work with that.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,000
So what we're going to do is add another statement here.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,960
So we're just going to add an else if on this.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,690
Go ahead get that set up.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,110
And similarly as above we want to you know check this.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,940
But in this situation rather than working with the Bluetooth adapter we want to work with the Bluetooth

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,780
device.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,690
So we're going to go ahead and type in here.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,510
Bluetooth device dot action and we want to do the action found that tells us hey we got something new.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:52,140
And see if this is equal to the action string that we had pulled out earlier.

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,240
So if that's the case this means you know that they found an actual Bluetooth device and you know now

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,310
we can learn some information about this.

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,680
So there's a couple of things that we can do here.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,550
The first thing is we have to extract the Bluetooth device or we're going to say cable a bluetooth device

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,590
is equal to device or device is equal to.

19
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:22,450
And this is where we're going to go and grab the intent and say intent get and we want the parsable

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,820
extra.

21
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:36,790
And once we have that we're looking for capital Bluetooth device that extra device can and then this

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:43,930
Bluetooth device class here this allows us to get information about you know whatever it is that we

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:51,300
had just grabbed and let's see what sort of air it is that we're having a problem with here.

24
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:59,120
You know I believe we got oh I don't want parsable array extra I just want to parsable extra.

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,180
Now that's good.

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,590
I can see why there would be an error if I told them that that was going to be an array.

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,390
All right.

28
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,080
So with them in place there's a couple of cool things that we can do with the device and you can really

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,540
just see them with the auto complete if you just do device dot and say Get For example you could get

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,710
the address Bluetooth class bound state name type you use IDS like all sorts of different cool things.

31
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,510
The main ones that we want to be looking for are the address and the name.

32
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:31,660
So if we have a name that's going to be the best one to move forward with the next best thing would

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,360
be the address and then we also can find out how strong our signal is to something by using something

34
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,050
getting into something called RSS.

35
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,220
And so let's go ahead and dive into each of these I'm just going to make a bunch of strings so the first

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,580
one is going to be the name so just say string name is equal to the device get name the next item that

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,620
we're going to be looking for is we want to go ahead and get the address are going to say address is

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,500
equal to device that get address.

39
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:08,200
And then lastly in order to get the RSS side it's a little bit of a multi-step process here.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,770
So the first thing that we want to do is this one's going to be represented by an end.

41
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:21,900
So we're going to say Aunt our SS is equal to K and this is where it gets a little crazy we're going

42
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,510
to say intent not get short extra just like we had done before.

43
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:37,170
And then inside of here we want to do capital Bluetooth device dot and then we're going to say extra

44
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,870
and we want the our access.

45
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,840
So this tells us about that also.

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:53,080
We're going to say we're going to do capital short here to say that we want the minimum value chain.

47
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,470
So this gives us back in our SSI these are kind of tricky numbers where I think essentially it's the

48
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,070
they're almost always negative numbers and they're like more negative.

49
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,240
The number is the stronger the connection you have.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,780
So you can kind of prioritize which Bluetooth devices are near or far away from you.

51
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,590
But we are able to then take this RSI our SSI information and we could turn it into a string so as a

52
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,290
matter of fact if we wanted to you know go ahead and convert this to a string we could say you know

53
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,230
integer to string.

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,960
Let's go ahead and pass and this whole shebang here.

55
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,430
All right.

56
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,680
Which then means we're in I have to say that this should be represented as a string but that should

57
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,260
make it easier when we're logging all this.

58
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:47,620
So if this all works let's go ahead and do the most epic log we've done yet in those cores.

59
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:54,790
We're going to say device found and this is the information that we want to provide.

60
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,810
So the first thing that we're going to say is we're going to state what the name is going to be namespace

61
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,810
and then we're going to add the name after that.

62
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,070
We want to add the address

63
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,600
space and then we're going to you guessed it add the address.

64
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,110
And after that we're going to add one more here we're going to say the last thing you're looking for

65
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,560
is the our SSI.

66
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,660
And let's go ahead and add that in at the end suicide.

67
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,570
Excellent.

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,450
Okay.

69
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,180
So a lot of information that we're log on there but I think we're up to it.

70
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,880
So we'll go ahead and run this on the actual device but Lague cat we really want to be paying attention

71
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,420
to that one.

72
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,330
So let's go ahead and get that ready to rock and roll and look.

73
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh I thought that was some information coming through I have to hit the search button first so I hit

74
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,740
search and look at this.

75
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,820
So we have some information coming through.

76
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,070
We have device found.

77
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,810
Name no address.

78
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,800
This string of letters and numbers are SSI negative 91 again.

79
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,110
Here's another name no native 80 So apparently this one's closer.

80
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,360
Negative 74 or even farther away that one's.

81
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,740
No no no.

82
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,170
And you'll notice it's pretty common to have the name be no on most Android devices.

83
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:26,320
Now for example I believe if I set up my Bluetooth preferences here on my Mac this was working earlier

84
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:34,240
I'm going to say open Bluetooth preferences case I've got this open and now if I go ahead and get all

85
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,490
the way down to the bottom and I hit search here I think it should find my Mac book.

86
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,960
So it's finding some devices like that.

87
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:50,440
It found that notebook pro that's the name of my mac book here you know kind of dumb joke there but

88
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,850
you know that sometimes Bluetooth devices can have a name so you know typically you're going to see

89
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,170
things like headphones would have a name.

90
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,340
You know I honestly trying to figure out what these different Bluetooth devices are around me.

91
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,640
I know that I have another computer here and my guess is that computers when they're not actively looking

92
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,870
for a Bluetooth like this don't broadcast that you know a proper name.

93
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,240
And you know it's I mean I can't tell you I'm trying to think about the devices around me.

94
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,880
I don't have a solid idea but it just shows you I think you'll be interested to see when you run this

95
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,210
how many Bluetooth devices there are sort of roaming around your spot.

96
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:31,770
Maybe they're not.

97
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,890
Maybe there's no bluetooth going on.

98
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,390
I'm just apparently bathing in Bluetooth.

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,300
But pretty interesting.

100
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,240
All the information that we can find there.

101
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,540
So with all of this I think we're really one step away from finishing our app and that's that we want

102
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,080
to show all this information inside of a list view and we want to be able to show users hey you know

103
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,980
there's a device that has this name if it has a name that's the one that we want to show if not maybe

104
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,180
we could show the address.

105
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,230
But I do also think it's worth showing the our SSI so they can know hey how near Is this thing.

106
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,150
So we're going to go ahead and cover how to do that in the next lecture.
