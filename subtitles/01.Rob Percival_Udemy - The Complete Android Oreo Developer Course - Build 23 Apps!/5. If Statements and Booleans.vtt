00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.020
All right now that you know what comments are going to be using that title what it is we're talking

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.540
about in each lecture and in this one we're going to be talking about if statements in booleans.

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.060
So first let's start with Boolean How do you create a boolean in cotland.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:22.660
All you do is make a variable give it some name like is the dog alive scan of a Morbelli example either

5
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.680
it's alive or it's dead.

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.450
I guess if you watch The Princess Bride you could say it's mostly that or something like that but with

7
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.530
a and you just simply set it equal to true or you said equal to false.

8
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.820
No quotes around it that would make it a string.

9
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.620
And the type for this is it's not you know bhool like this it's actually boolean.

10
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.630
So you have to type all the full boolean and if you're talking about the cotland type of true or false

11
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.560
and those are the only two things.

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.900
It can be equal to.

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.880
So there you have booleans.

14
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.970
Now if statements let's go ahead and talk about those you do if and then you put parentheses with some

15
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.460
sort of boolean inside of their expression and then you do curly brackets to say hey if this thing is

16
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.120
true go ahead and run the code that's in these curly brackets.

17
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.880
So for example we could put the is the dog alive and you know if it's equal to true will run on in here

18
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.750
you can put an else statement to say hey if that's not true we'll go ahead and do something here.

19
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.310
The other thing that you can do is obviously with their statements is you can compare things.

20
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.670
So if I made a variable like age I could you know make an if statement that checks to see if somebody

21
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.060
is over a particular age so I could say if age is greater than 18 you know then I could pronounce something

22
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.600
like you were able to ride the ride and if not you could say you're not able to ride the ride.

23
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.940
I'm guessing this would be some code at like a theme park or something.

24
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.150
I don't know.

25
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.730
But you can do greater than you can do less than you can do greater than or equal to.

26
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.880
Same thing with less then if you want to see two things are exactly the same used to equal sign.

27
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.810
If you want to say check and see if things are not equal to each other use the exclamation point and

28
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.280
then the equal sign.

29
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.680
You can test multiple things if you want by using two Ampere's stamps to say OK if age is not 18 and

30
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.040
you know is the dog alive.

31
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.030
That's like you know checking another condition there or if you want it rather than do that and you

32
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.060
can say or by doing the two straight up line so to get to this you have to say shift and then hit the

33
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.970
backslash key to get those up and down lines but.

34
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.640
So this is saying if either one of these things is true then you run the code inside of here because

35
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.530
that's true.

36
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.970
And the Ampere's stamp and is saying OK this thing has to be true and this thing has to be true in under.

37
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.290
In order to ride run the code that's going to be inside of here.

38
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.770
So again you probably know what if statements are and how to use them.

39
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.470
So I think you're probably good with what we have here.

40
00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.420
Let's go ahead and dive into our challenge and simply what I want you to do is create a variable that's

41
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.620
equal to your name.

42
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:16.710
So make a variable called name and then make an if statement.

43
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.140
To check if your name is equal to Nick.

44
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.140
If so

45
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.230
print

46
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:41.000
Nick is a box Boz I don't think I spelled both correctly like I wanted to.

47
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.410
But anyways there's a chapel challenge very simple but go ahead and do that now.

48
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.970
OK.

49
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.820
So hopefully this went well for you.

50
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.450
You create a variable that is called name said equal to your name.

51
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.780
So the odds of your name being Nick is very low but so if it is congratulations you what the code we're

52
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:11.770
supposed to run is to say hey if name is equal to Nick then we are going to do a print line where we

53
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.940
print out.

54
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.510
Nick is a boss just like that.

55
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.890
And all of a sudden boom all works are going to go ahead and run my code.

56
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.140
See if this is really the case.

57
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.560
And oh my goodness look at that.

58
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.390
Nick in fact is the boss.

59
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.300
All right we're going to keep moving forward and the next one we are going to be talking about four

60
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.620
loops.
