1
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.110
All right.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.320
Welcome to the section where we're going to finally get started here building this Instagram app.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.990
And so the thing that we want to focus on here is the log in screen.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.250
And so this is what it is that you're aiming to build We're going to have a nice Instagram logo at the

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.870
top.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.860
You can enter in a username and password if you don't if you forget to enter the username or the password

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.140
either one if you try and sign up or something.

8
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.330
So the message that says hey a username and password is required but if you go ahead and enter in the

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.650
proper information like a user I created earlier John ABC 1 2 3 and I try and sign up.

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.590
So this is a new user that I use or that Benk already created if I try and sign up that person I should

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.790
get a message says hey that already exists.

12
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.720
But if I switch to log in and I have the proper information I log in I should have logged out in Android

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.250
studio that hey it was successful you don't have to visually show anything for that because our next

14
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.940
step is we want to make it actually start the app and move into the main screens there.

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.540
But that's the challenge for you.

16
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.760
We want you to do as much of this as you can on your own and I'll come back and help you out.

17
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.660
Good luck.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.190
So in this lecture we're going to start building this Instagram clone.

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.080
And the thing that we want to build here is the log in slash Sign-Up screen.

20
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.010
And before we get started with anything we want to make that page look really nice so we're going to

21
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.520
dive into the visual side of things.

22
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.460
And there's a couple of steps that we've got to do to get there.

23
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.710
So one of them is that if we go to our Android studio project you may see this with your particular

24
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.880
project you may not see it but if we go to Edit the layout file will you open up this activity main.

25
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.170
You may see a kind of greyed out screen here that doesn't allow us to update the information that's

26
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.510
inside of this relative layout that we have here you get it saying Android dot dot dot action are really

27
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.830
lay out.

28
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.500
So if this is the case for you if you're seeing this hopefully I'm going to try and get some fixes in

29
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.120
there so you won't run into this issue if you just have a white screen that means you're ready to rock

30
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.380
and roll.

31
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.900
But if you do have this we can fix it.

32
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.750
And what we're gonna do is we're going to close out of that and then we're going to go to our cradle

33
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.510
scripts here and we want to do the buildout grateful for the module.

34
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.540
So double click on that.

35
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.710
And then once we're there we want to update this for the latest version of Android so we're going to

36
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.160
change this compile SDK version to 26.

37
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.140
This minimum SDK version that's going to be 26 target 26 and if we scroll down here we want to change

38
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.790
this from 23 to 26 point zero point zero.

39
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.600
So just take a second to go ahead and do those updates there.

40
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.420
And once you've done that you can go ahead and hit sync now.

41
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.790
And this is going to take a moment to kind of go through everything and get this project ready to rock

42
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.550
and roll.

43
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.360
But while it is doing this let's go ahead and go to their browser because part of making this nice logon

44
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.170
screen is we need a good image.

45
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.240
So let's open up a new tab and you can use whatever sort of sites search you want to go get a good image.

46
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.100
We need some sort of Instagram icon.

47
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.430
I like the website flat icon dot com.

48
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.250
I'll go ahead and do a little search for Instagram.

49
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.120
Remember wherever you get your images make sure that if you're going to release it on the store that

50
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.410
you have proper rights to use those images so here on flat icon you just have to give.

51
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.020
Excuse me.

52
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.030
You have to give proper respect to the Creator so here it's free pick.

53
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.300
And again you know we're not putting this in the App Store but it could be as simple as referencing

54
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.050
them at some point your app you want to use that or there's a paid version where you don't even have

55
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.470
to mention that but getting too deep into the weeds here.

56
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.460
Let's go ahead and download a version let's do maybe 256 PMG here.

57
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.550
That's a nice looking logo.

58
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.380
And let's go ahead and throw that on our desktop.

59
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.840
OK let's go back to android studio.

60
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.900
Looks like things have been fixed up here let's look at our activity main.

61
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.940
See if that's fix things for us we might have to end up deleting this file and opening it again.

62
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.450
We'll go ahead and give it a second here to work itself out.

63
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.600
No it looks like it's going to be OK.

64
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.420
So with that in place let's go ahead and start building this out.

65
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.950
And part of that is going to be getting that Instagram image into our apps are going to Right-Click

66
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.930
rez here.

67
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.510
We want to do a new resource directory because we want to have a draw bowlful there so we can out of

68
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.790
that image we're going to draw all OK there and then I'm going to go to my desktop I'm going to copy

69
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.990
this Instagram image and I'm going to paste it here.

70
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.820
It's going to ask do you want to have this in.

71
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.850
I'm going to say yes and now let's give ourselves some space to work with here.

72
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.450
We want to bring out a image so we're going to select image view and just drag and drop it here.

73
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.060
It's going to ask what images you want to put in there so let's just go ahead and search for Instagram.

74
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.370
We'll hit enter that allow us to bring that and so we want to have this near the top but we don't want

75
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.620
it to be that big.

76
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.090
So rather than wrap content we're going to just a specified amount here and this is a square image so

77
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:11.740
maybe we could just simply say 50 by 50 looks maybe a little bit small I might bump that up to like

78
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.850
70 by 70 either.

79
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.340
But we'll have that Instagram image the next thing that we need to be adding Here is some added text

80
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.880
because the basic idea with this is we want users to be able to put in a user name and they also should

81
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.390
be able to put in their passwords then hit sign in.

82
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.630
So let's go to text and we're going to bring out a plain text here or edit text and we'll bring in a

83
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.860
little bit below.

84
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.890
We want to make this nice and wide so we'll just say go ahead and match parent.

85
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.130
We're also going to bring out another one of these below.

86
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.000
And on this one too we'll say we want you to match parent and then we're going to bring out a button

87
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.380
below all this that says Sign up.

88
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.120
So we'll have this button and we're going to double click on this button to change its text to say sign

89
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:11.830
up and we've got that and then we need to change these to edit text so for the first one we want to

90
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.580
get rid of the what we want to add a hint there and get rid of this name thing so we'll get rid of that

91
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.210
name and we're going to add a hint here and the hint is going to be a user name and then we'll come

92
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.130
down here for our next one.

93
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.850
Get rid of name and we're going to add as our hand password so the user knows those are the two things

94
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.140
that they should be typing in that box.

95
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.590
Now with this sign up button we want to make sure that we give a name for it's on click.

96
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.530
So let's go ahead and add a name like sign up clicked.

97
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.970
That looks good.

98
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.290
And with this in place we just have to give some ideas to that.

99
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.760
So image you too I don't think we'll be working with the image.

100
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.140
So that's probably fine.

101
00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:02.720
But for this we want to call this something like user name a text for this guy here.

102
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:12.330
Say yes to this for our password friend we're gonna say password it Tex let's get rid of that too and

103
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.910
I'll say yes to that.

104
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.660
And what the sign up button we'll call it.

105
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.650
Sign up button and we'll add that.

106
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.570
So now that we have the proper IDs in place it's time to go write some code for when someone hits the

107
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.550
Sign-Up button.

108
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.180
So let's go to our main activity here.

109
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:39.690
And we have a whole lot of code from last time so I'm going to go ahead and clear out most of this.

110
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:46.960
So on this parce analytics stuff but from here I guess even before this on Create we want to make a

111
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:54.640
new method in which we are going to be you know responding to the unclick and we had given her on the

112
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.690
name of sign up clicked.

113
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.550
So let's just go ahead and copy that to make sure we don't make any mistakes.

114
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.200
We're going to save public void

115
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.730
sign up collect we're going to have a view passed inside of there which we'll just call you and then

116
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.530
we'll do our curly brackets.

117
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:21.210
Then once we have that in place we have to get access to the to edit text so we'll say edit text.

118
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:30.300
We'll call this one user name edit text and this will just be equal to find view by ID.

119
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:40.340
Apple art ID that name added text and I'll be one we can copy and paste most of this for the next text

120
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:47.060
because they're so similar just this one will be called Password edit text and we'll have to change

121
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.660
this to password and it text.

122
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.990
So then once we have access to both of those.

123
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.670
The first thing that we want to temptin sort of check for is make sure that you know we have both a

124
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.620
user name and password.

125
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.590
So what we're going to do is we're going to do a little statement here.

126
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.510
I say little you're going to watch this is going to end up being pretty big and the first thing we want

127
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:16.670
to check is let's get the username added text dot get text dot and then we want to turn that into a

128
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.170
string.

129
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.210
And we want to check and see if this is equal to an empty string.

130
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:31.040
So if that's equal to an empty string or we have the password at it text get text to string is equal

131
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.980
to an empty string if either of these things are true.

132
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.590
We want to send a message to the user that the username and password are required.

133
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.080
So we'll do a text message here.

134
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.350
I say.

135
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:52.850
Make text and in this all past this is a context and then we'll say something like a user name and a

136
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:59.360
password are required so that the user knows you know something's wrong they didn't give the proper

137
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.910
information and then the next thing is we have to say how long we want this to show force or how to

138
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.400
say toast.

139
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:11.300
I like length short you can decide that and then we'll finally show this toast message.

140
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:11.680
All right.

141
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.220
So that's the situation.

142
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:20.510
If they were you know didn't enter in both a user name and password but the else of the situation is

143
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.350
a good situation.

144
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:27.310
This means they have those two things in place and we should attempt to sign up the user.

145
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.660
So we're going to come to the logon portion of a second here.

146
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.560
But we want to focus on signing up.

147
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.550
So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to get a parse user and we'll just call this

148
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.760
person user and this is a new parse user.

149
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:50.540
Once we're here we've got to set the user's username and password which we have from the text so we

150
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:56.240
can say that username that set user name and it's looking for a string.

151
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:03.770
So we're going to get to the user name and text that get text that does not get text that was something

152
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.480
much bigger.

153
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:11.340
And here we go get text dot to string and then I'll successfully go and grab that.

154
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.510
We also want to set the password.

155
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:21.500
So then we'll go to our password edit text get text not to string.

156
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.320
You probably got to guess that one half.

157
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.970
And once we have those things in place we are ready to sign up this users are going to say user that

158
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:35.580
sign up in background we want to get access to the callback so we're going to say new sign up callback

159
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.850
there and we simply just want to know if this worked out.

160
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:46.430
So we're going to check our exception here we're going to say if E is cool to know make sure we have

161
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.520
two equal sign there so if it's equal to no.

162
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.420
That means things are probably good.

163
00:11:51.570 --> 00:12:00.570
Then we can go ahead and write out some sort of message like saying you know maybe the sign up I forgot

164
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:11.220
that we were trying to do a log here so when I say log I will say sign up comma success.

165
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.400
I forgot to put that in double quotes.

166
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.830
There we go.

167
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.760
That looks better.

168
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.190
So we've got that in place.

169
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:26.240
But if for some reason we aren't able to get the sign up process to work we need to display the reason

170
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.380
why so the user knows what's going on.

171
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.950
So we're going to do a toast as well here so we're going to say whoa stop make text this.

172
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.470
And then for the string we're actually going to use the exception and on the exception we can do a dot

173
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.250
get message.

174
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:46.940
And this is a little bit of a friendlier sort of text that we can show to the user that's not going

175
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.820
to show some big massive you know error code that would kind of freak them out.

176
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.170
So and this situation to say.

177
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.540
Yes.

178
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.480
Message that's the thing that we want to show the user decide how long we want this to show up for sure

179
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.140
it's a good idea and then we'll go ahead and show that.

180
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:10.270
So with this all in place let's go ahead and run this on our device see what this looks like.

181
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:21.240
Oh we are getting an error here and this is because we need to get to the main activity.

182
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:26.740
This should fix our issues there but we're in the middle of building.

183
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:34.420
So we'll see if you know that kind of crapped out so we'll get run again and hopefully this time we'll

184
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.480
get success there.

185
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:41.350
So the basic idea here is we're first going to check and see if either of these strings these added

186
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:46.390
text were left empty if they were going to do a little Tulse to say hey these you know username and

187
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:51.850
password required but if not we're going to try and sign up if it's successful we should see a new user

188
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.010
created in the back end on parce.

189
00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:00.510
So pretty exciting moment here for us so we'll get our emulator up here.

190
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.130
And just wait till this finishes.

191
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.960
So our app opened up and here it is let's go ahead and you know try just hit the sign up button without

192
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.930
even you know typing anything inside so I'll go ahead and hit that and look at this.

193
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.730
We get a Java dot laying exception which is not exactly what.

194
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.660
But still we can say something username cannot be missing or blank.

195
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:29.270
OK so we are getting an air here and what actually happened is that did try and do the sign up process.

196
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:36.920
But the reason for that is because we kind of poorly did the check here to see if these things were

197
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.050
completely empty.

198
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.690
So we want to do a little bit of a better check here.

199
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:47.360
And so what we're going to do is after we've done our two string we're going to say Dot matches and

200
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.200
we'll put an empty string inside of there.

201
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:55.530
And again we'll do the same thing here or we're going to say Dot matches and we'll go ahead and put

202
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.330
in an empty string there.

203
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:03.770
So with that change in place hopefully we'll see a little bit of an error code here because that was

204
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:08.620
not one that you would expect to see as a user you know.

205
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.980
That was our fault as programmers.

206
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.680
You know we were using the wrong sorts of statements.

207
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.910
So let's see what we get now.

208
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:23.680
Here comes the app and all sign up and give out a username and password are required.

209
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.760
And let's say I put it in a new username like John and I hit sign up still that says that because I

210
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.870
don't have a password.

211
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:37.490
So let's go ahead and put in a password maybe I'll just say ABC 1 2 3 and we'll go ahead and sign up

212
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.120
and we don't see any toasts here.

213
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:47.630
But if we go to our to do or log and excuse me we should see Sign-Up success.

214
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.850
So that means it's telling us that it went through correctly.

215
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:56.240
Well let's go ahead and confirm this by going to our parce dashboard let's reload this page and look

216
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:56.620
at that.

217
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.750
We have a new user John.

218
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.850
So to sort of test our code as well.

219
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:06.080
Let's go ahead and try hitting Sign-Up again for John and if we hit sign up we'll get that account already

220
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.710
exists for this username so we know that.

221
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.600
All right.

222
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.360
You know we're getting back some good information if we try and sign up with the same name or something

223
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.290
like that.

224
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.340
All right.

225
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:23.750
So excellent starting point here really the next thing for us to do is we've got to add the option now

226
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.290
for someone to log in.

227
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:31.190
So we're going to go back to android studio and we're going to work on the visual side of things again.

228
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:37.250
So we want to add an option sort of off here to the side that says you know you can sign up or you could

229
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.060
log in.

230
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.210
And so we could use another button.

231
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.110
It might look a little bit tacky.

232
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.230
So we're going to take just a regular text view here.

233
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.100
We're going to put it right off to the side.

234
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:55.100
And with this in place we're going to give it some sort of text like or comma log in.

235
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.280
Just like that.

236
00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.560
And there's a few other changes that we want to make here specifically the text color.

237
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.210
We want to be different from other text so that the user kind of knows oh this is something that I could

238
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.430
probably tap on and interact with.

239
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:12.560
So with this we can go ahead and choose an option maybe this blue looks pretty good.

240
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.320
I think that kind of conveys what we're trying to do.

241
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:15.810
Yeah.

242
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.080
I think that looks pretty good.

243
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:23.480
And I might bump up the font on this and I believe that's through text size that we can do that so it's

244
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.810
me you see it 20 looks like.

245
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:31.620
Yeah I think that's pretty good so we'll have that off to the side there.

246
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:36.830
The next thing that we've got to do is you've got to make it so that this text view can actually be

247
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:42.100
selected right like that we have we are listening to see whether or not it's been tapped.

248
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.330
So to do that there's a few things that we've got to do.

249
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:50.480
Let's go to our main activity we've done this before but after we have this extends app compatibility

250
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:58.400
we're going to write some extra code that says implements we're going to do capital view dot on click

251
00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.050
listener.

252
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:06.280
So this is saying hey this is you know can handle when different elements are being clicked on and where

253
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:12.560
you have to go and implement a function for that so we're going to do on click if you just go ahead

254
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.490
and type that out should be able to hit enter there and that's going to get rid of that era that you

255
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.100
saw up top.

256
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.220
Now that we have this in place we want to check and make sure that the thing that they've clicked is

257
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:29.360
in fact the proper text view so we're going to do an if statement here where we're going to say if our

258
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:39.230
curly brackets are in there and we want to do you dot get ID gives us back in and we're going to see

259
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:47.120
if this is equal to our dot ID and I realized we haven't given a proper ID to this text so we'll maybe

260
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:54.770
call this log in text view it's a little bit maybe not the greatest name because these are going to

261
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.910
switch between being log in and sign up.

262
00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.090
But with this kind of work with that paradigm for now.

263
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:06.800
But now we should be able to say Dot log in text view and we can check and make sure that this is the

264
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.020
correct one.

265
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:12.920
So if this is the case let's go ahead and make sure we're on the right track by logging out some info

266
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.250
and say switch

267
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.350
was tapped.

268
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.400
OK.

269
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.050
So once we have that in place we're still not done here.

270
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:33.190
We're going to have to scroll down to our on create method and inside of here is where we're going to

271
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:38.680
want to set this text view is should be you know looking for that function.

272
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.500
So first we've got to have access to the text views are going to say text view and let's just call this

273
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:56.830
log in text view and say this is equal to find view by ID are done the log in text view.

274
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.970
Simple as that.

275
00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:05.520
Then once that's in place we want to take this log in text view and let me do the proper importing here

276
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.960
so go ahead and hit enter.

277
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.010
And I'm still not happy with what we have.

278
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.510
Let's go ahead and let's see loggin text few here.

279
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:25.030
I mean ultimately what we do is set on click listener so we do this on click listener or pass and this.

280
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:30.220
And let's see if we can't figure out what's going on here implicit cast out because we are working with

281
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.950
a different version of Android here.

282
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:39.820
We're going to have to cast this to say that this is going to be of type text you hear when we go ahead

283
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:48.160
and pass that through and unexpected view takes you like a tag was relative way out.

284
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.770
Oh I've probably given the incorrect name too.

285
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.190
Yep I've called the whole relatively out the log in text you so I'm going to cut that and I'm going

286
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:04.300
to call this lay out and then I'm going to now select the text view and paste in the proper information.

287
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.550
So yeah I don't even think the casting was necessarily the problem let's see if we can delete that and

288
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.650
get.

289
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.060
Yeah.

290
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.480
That was not the issue.

291
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.010
OK.

292
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:17.070
So we're in a much better place here now that we've got this going.

293
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:23.350
Let's go ahead and test this to see if we can get that information to shop so we'll go ahead and run

294
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:28.780
this on the emulator and once we can confirm that we can get this information to log out.

295
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:34.120
The next step for us is going to be making it so that when they click on that that we can you know change

296
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.150
everything from being in the sign up mode to a log and load.

297
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.860
But then if they tap it again to go back to a log in mode we just want to be able to switch between

298
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.750
the two states there.

299
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.900
So here it comes.

300
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:51.400
Let's go ahead and hit that text view and let's have log cat here so that we can see what's going on

301
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.510
and whoops want to close this out.

302
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:58.240
If I

303
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.940
don't just log out there we go.

304
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:05.820
Great.

305
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.350
Now I'm showing.

306
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.490
Put that down and log.

307
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.120
There we go.

308
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:12.810
Geez.

309
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.640
So once this is open let's tap this a few times and look at that.

310
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.050
It's showing up down below.

311
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.770
OK.

312
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:24.020
So we know that that's working for us after we've done this.

313
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.430
I mean so we probably don't need to say that this was tapped.

314
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:32.370
But like I said the next thing is we want to get the proper setup here.

315
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.950
So there's a couple of things that we want to do.

316
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.620
And the first one is we should have a boolean appear at the top that tells us whether or in sign up

317
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.920
mode or log it moated we can kind of switch back and forth whenever we hit this on.

318
00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:51.440
So I'm going to make a new boolean that I'm going to call sign up mode active K and this is going to

319
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.940
tell us whether or not we're in sign up motor logging mode and I'm going to set it equal to true.

320
00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:03.470
Initially a few of the things that we're going to need is that log in button we should have that text

321
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:10.040
view we should have that up here so I'm actually just going to go down and copy this.

322
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:18.800
Delete the beginning part here and I'll go ahead and paste that up top so we have access to it here

323
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.730
inside.

324
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.660
We want to have access to the actual sign up button.

325
00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:31.440
So we're going to say button and I'll call the sign up button is equal to find view by id Capitol our

326
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.160
ID dot sign up button.

327
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.330
OK.

328
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:42.590
Now with these things in place we can sort of do a little statement on when someone is trying to switch

329
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:47.660
from one mode to the other so that if we want to check for as well what mode are we in so we're going

330
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.420
to say if I sign up mode active.

331
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:58.700
So if they are currently in Sign-Up mode this means they're trying to go to log in mode.

332
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.650
So what we're going to do is we're going to take our sign up mode active and we're going to set this

333
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.250
equal to false.

334
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.610
Next step for us is we have to update our sign up button.

335
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:15.890
So we're going to take our sign up button and we're going to say set text on that and the text that

336
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.490
we want to set it equal to is just simply log in.

337
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.110
But then we also want to update this text for you to say you know how you can switch back to sign up

338
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:40.080
if you want to sort of a log and text few dot set text and we are going to pass in there or comma sign

339
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.150
up so go ahead and add that.

340
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:48.240
So now you can probably imagine the situation is basically the exact opposite of all this.

341
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.750
I'm going to copy all this code and just line by line do the opposite.

342
00:24:51.750 --> 00:25:02.970
So the set of false should be true sort of log in I should say sign up and this should say or log in.

343
00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.420
And I guess I'm kind of being inconsistent here.

344
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.990
I want to be consistent.

345
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.650
This is going to say sign up sign up and I should probably go back here and change this to oh we have

346
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:14.720
sign up separated there.

347
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.190
OK.

348
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.600
So we're at a good place.

349
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.010
So that should be a good looking chap.

350
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.860
Let's go ahead and give it the old Tester's ski.

351
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.860
We'll hit it run here and see what this looks like so we should see the text for the button and the

352
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:35.490
text for you sort of flipping back and forth and sort of behind the scenes this boolean should be switching

353
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.370
back and forth and we'll know that it's working.

354
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.340
If we see that text switching back and forth so here's the emulator to hit that button.

355
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.780
Oh yeah look at that we can just ding the leaning leaning thing.

356
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.660
Go ahead and fly between each of those.

357
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:54.900
So with that in place now that we can you know determine whether an loggin mode or Sign-Up mode what

358
00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:00.620
we want to do now is you know after we make sure they've added added a username and a password when

359
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.480
we're coming down here to you know do the sign up.

360
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.730
We only want to do the Sign-Up is you know if they're in Sign-Up mode so do an if statement here where

361
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:14.660
we say if sign up mode active we'll do our opening curly bracket and we want to do that.

362
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:19.790
If I do all this stuff up to this point if that's the case we get that nice tab.

363
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:26.070
But then we have an else to say hey if that didn't work out this is a log in situation.

364
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.490
So this is when we want to log somebody in.

365
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.480
So this is where we're going to go ahead and write the code in order to log someone in.

366
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:41.590
So we'll just say capital parse user up log in in background and a few things that we've got to pass

367
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:42.360
side of here.

368
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:49.110
So the first one is we got to get that user name edit text not get text string.

369
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.940
That gives us the user name.

370
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.370
Next we got to do a similar thing for the passwords.

371
00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.740
Get the other text.

372
00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:58.470
Get text to string.

373
00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.440
Excellent.

374
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:07.420
And then the last thing that we need is a new we want this to be log in callback.

375
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.450
So this will tell us you know whether or not this all worked out.

376
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:16.830
So do a quick check here to make sure we actually have users around to say as long as a user is not

377
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.310
equal to know.

378
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.300
That means we're probably in a good place.

379
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:24.920
Let's just go ahead and log out or say log out.

380
00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:34.470
Not trying to log out of the app I want to log some information that says something like log in and

381
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.080
we'll say OK.

382
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.600
Exclamation point.

383
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:45.330
And the else in the situation is when we would want to display a message to the user so we can actually

384
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:50.580
just copy this code that we had for when someone's trying to do a sign up and paste it in.

385
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.080
Because in both situations the exception is called.

386
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.880
So we can just go ahead and do that.

387
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.830
So with that in place let's go ahead and give this a test we'll hit the run button here.

388
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.900
And this is kind of our big moment of truth.

389
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.010
We should see you know we're able to successfully sign people up.

390
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.310
Maybe we were not able to but let's go and check it out.

391
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:19.440
The one that I want to work with is this new user John will try signing up with a wrong password and

392
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.300
see what we get there.

393
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:26.040
So we're going to put John for the name and then let's do a password of like I'm just going to enter

394
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.670
in some random jibberish and I'm going to try and sign up.

395
00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.480
So we should get the message account already exists.

396
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.290
That's good.

397
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.760
But let's switch to log in.

398
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.080
I'm going to try and log in.

399
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.690
It's going to say Invalid username password.

400
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:44.180
OK well what happens if I go ahead and change this to ABC 1 2 3.

401
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:50.520
We don't see anything here but that should mean that if we go back to android studio inside of log had

402
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.150
Look at that the log in is OK.

403
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.180
So that means we're ready to rock and roll.

404
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.210
So it's with that message that we know that this app is officially ready to go.

405
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.760
Really the next step for us is if we go ahead and look at this emulator here there's one kind of big

406
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.280
glaring thing that I want to fix and that's this keyboard is kind of just in the way I'd like it if

407
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.330
I clicked outside of it for it to disappear and I'd like it so that I could hit this button when I'm

408
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.930
finished typing my password and it will automatically be entered in.

409
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.110
So that's what we're going to cover in the next lecture.

410
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.400
I just actually realized what we're looking at this.

411
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.690
We have our password exposed without showing the proper sort of password.

412
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:32.220
You know dot dot dot to sort of hide what it is that the user is typing in case someone you know they're

413
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:38.650
in a public place on their phone which is quite common so let's get our second text here.

414
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:45.150
And once we're there we want to go ahead and update the input type and we want to change this to be

415
00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.720
text password.

416
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.300
So let's go ahead and find that boom we've got the text password.

417
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:51.840
Go ahead.

418
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.630
Hit OK on that and now we'll go ahead and type.

419
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:59.010
We should see the dots but still sort of the bigger thing and what we're going to be covering in the

420
00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:05.580
next lecture is the fact that you know we need to be able to have some sort of relationship to manage

421
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.670
that keyboard.

422
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.750
So let's go ahead and test this out make sure we type something.

423
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.490
Oh yeah.

424
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.640
Those there's those bullet points we're looking for.

425
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.770
Let's try and log in with this says Invalid username password.

426
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:19.920
Of course some random name random password wouldn't work.

427
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.250
OK.

428
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.350
Let's go check that out.
