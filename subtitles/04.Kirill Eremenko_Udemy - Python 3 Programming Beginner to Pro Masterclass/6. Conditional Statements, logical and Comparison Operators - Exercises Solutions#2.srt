00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,580
Let's keep going.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,370
Let's solve.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,890
Question for you.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:13,170
I'm asking Given that input dictionary which is key 120 key 233 550.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:22,020
OK here I I'm asking you to write a code to select a dictionary elements that are greater than or equal

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,240
to 30.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,560
So he was just going to obtain try to obtain the value here of the first element within the dictionary

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,710
and see the R equals to a greater than or equal to 30 or not.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,040
OK.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,870
And simply opt in that value and put it somewhere else here.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,640
I just added a quick quick note here we haven't covered for loops yet we haven't covered how to do you

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,980
know a repeated operation yet.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,720
Sheila I just wanted to do it manually anyway.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,100
All right.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,050
Let's see how can we do this.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,650
Let's try a quick sample first.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:54,980
All right.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,540
So let's see how can we actually obtain the value within the dictionary if you guys remember from previous

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,000
lectures that in order to obtain let's say the number of the value of 20 here associated with that key

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,780
one we're going to call the dictionary with its name going to say OK input underscore dictionary.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,840
OK.

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,990
And open square brackets and we're going to say OK I need the value associated to the key one.

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,850
All right.

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,660
First you need to run this to compute shift enter then run this shift enter and you come up with a value

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,580
of 20.

27
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,260
Okay.

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,790
When obtain let's say the second value I'm going to say okay instead of to make it make it so that one

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:39,060
to get to run it and you've come up with a value of 30 which is the value associated to that key here

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,320
let's try to obtain the third value.

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,290
So it will come up with a value of 50.

32
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:45,870
All right.

33
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,350
Looks great.

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,840
Okay let's go back to key.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,750
So I want to do here is that we wanted to simply want to compare the value of only open the parameters

36
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,080
that are only greater than 30 right.

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:05,030
So simply I need to write an if condition I'm going to say okay if wherever value they're going to be

38
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,740
obtaining here right.

39
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:13,800
If this value is greater than or equal to 30 column right enter.

40
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,590
I need to obtain that value and prove it.

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,790
Put it somewhere else.

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,150
Okay.

43
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,530
And place it in a list right.

44
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,690
Which means here.

45
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,400
I need to create a new list right.

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,350
So I'm to simply go here and create a new list I'm going to call it let's say out okay for instance

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,830
and I'm going to initialize it as let's say empty.

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,750
So this is kind of an empty list.

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,030
Okay.

50
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,970
So what I wanted to do here I'm going to say OK I wanted to if the input dictionary of key one simply

51
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:56,150
if 20 is greater than 30 I'm gonna say okay out right Dot I'm going to use the append method.

52
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,620
Right.

53
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:04,960
And I'm going to say OK let's optimize that value which is input dictionary of key 1 which is the value

54
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,650
here.

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,660
And that sets appended basically take that value and append it just kind of stick it or add it to our

56
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,850
output list here.

57
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,060
All right.

58
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,100
Let's run this.

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,150
If we run it and if we take a look let's say it out.

60
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,040
And if we just shift enter you will come up with basically an empty array.

61
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,460
Okay.

62
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,770
Why why is that.

63
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,380
Simply put because 20 is actually not greater than or equal to 30.

64
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,070
And that's why the even if we on this condition the body of the F hasn't been satisfied hasn't been

65
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,680
rain yet.

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,120
Right.

67
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,680
OK so that looks good.

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:43,980
Right.

69
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,260
So this is the first step.

70
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,250
Again a here on what I'm going to do we're going to do everything manually OK.

71
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,910
This is kind of a very basic preliminary way of writing a code.

72
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,000
But here the idea is to try to teach you how to learn together how can we perform and if else condition

73
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,970
in a very simple format.

74
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,210
All right.

75
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,950
Let's do it again.

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,450
Let's repeat the exact same if condition but we're going to do a repeat it to all all of them right.

77
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,220
So I need three of them right.

78
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,660
One for key one.

79
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,990
One for Key two.

80
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:20,760
And if it's right out in key two and put it here I'm going to say okay let's go compare key three and

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,820
compare two key three looks good.

82
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,320
All right let's run it.

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,030
Shift enter.

84
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,170
Let's try it.

85
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,220
And that's what we are expecting.

86
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,420
We're actually expecting because 30 is actually equal to 30.

87
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,750
Right.

88
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,050
So this condition has been satisfied.

89
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,010
So we actually obtained the parameter and appended to our output list here.

90
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,980
So that's why you're seeing the value of 30.

91
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:50,000
And here's it since key three which is 50 was actually greater than or equal to 30.

92
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,540
The condition has been satisfied.

93
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,900
So we actually performed around the actual body of the if condition and we appended the value which

94
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,460
is 50 to the our output list and that's it.

95
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,880
That's pretty much how can we solve this question.

96
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,830
All right I hope you guys were able to figure that out.

97
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,620
Let's keep going.

98
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,390
Let's see.

99
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,550
Question five here.

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,460
I'm saying okay write a code that ticks a number from a user and compare it to a randomly generated

101
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,860
randomly generated.

102
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,420
So here this My apologies generated.

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,710
Okay.

104
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,780
No.

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,570
And simply state which one is larger or smaller.

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:33,840
All right.

107
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,030
So let's see how can we do this.

108
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,530
So there's actually speedy and I say advanced but a little bit like you know like there is lot of information

109
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,490
in here.

110
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,710
So what I'm going to do here I'm going to say OK I need to take data from the user.

111
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,180
When I say okay user which is a variable we're going to be obtaining from the user.

112
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,970
I'm going to get input and I'm going to say ask the user enter a number.

113
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,750
Okay let's say between 1 and 100.

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,480
OK.

115
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,470
All right.

116
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,400
Please bear in mind that the input we're going return the string right.

117
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,270
But in order because we wanted to perform comparison at some point make sure to cast it into an integer.

118
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,460
So whatever we're going to be getting here we're going to actually converted two into an integer.

119
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,870
Right.

120
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,480
And put it in the user here.

121
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:28,800
Let's run that and after you enter number between one 100 lists let's say say 20 plus enter and nothing

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,250
happened.

123
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,390
If you take it if you go ahead and check the user you will find the value of 20 which is what we have

124
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,060
just entered.

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,640
Looks great.

126
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,900
The next part is I wanted to compare that value to a randomly generated number which means I have to

127
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,840
use the random generator.

128
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,160
Right.

129
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:52,010
So to do that I'm going to say okay import gonna import random okay.

130
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,670
I am going to say OK let's use for example whatever value I'm going to call it let's say comparison.

131
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,570
OK.

132
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,500
Which is the random generated number.

133
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,270
OK equal to random dot Rand.

134
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,720
And so Rand ends and I pass along a number between 1 and 100 OK.

135
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,250
Let's run that.

136
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,730
Let's take a look at comp if we run it.

137
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,960
You will come up with the number 20 as well.

138
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,120
Let's run it again.

139
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,970
You'll come up with number 68.

140
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,770
One more time you come up with number 12 which is simply you are generating random numbers between 1

141
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,390
and 100.

142
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:30,830
All right.

143
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,120
That's perfect.

144
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,190
Now we have two variables.

145
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,980
We have the user which is the value that has been fed or input by the user.

146
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,050
And we have a random generator number called comp comparison.

147
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,670
And now we're actually ready to use our if else condition.

148
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,440
All right.

149
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,500
Let's see how can we do this math.

150
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,320
OK.

151
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,090
So what we need to do here we're going to say let's assume that we wanted to perform the if condition.

152
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:04,730
Going to say OK if you found the user value was greater than the comp value OK we are going to print

153
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:20,360
to the user let's say going to say OK the value you entered the value entered is greater than the randomly

154
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,730
randomly generated value all right.

155
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,300
OK.

156
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,470
Looks great here.

157
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm saying OK.

158
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:44,100
Else if you found the user value was equal to the comparison value we're going to see Okay print and

159
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,680
we're going to say here.

160
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:59,700
Let's say value entered is equal to the randomly generated value.

161
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,050
All right.

162
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,480
OK.

163
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,000
Looks great.

164
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,100
And then the else which is the last one I'm going to say Okay print.

165
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,490
If it's not equal and if it's not greater then then obviously it's less then what is smaller then let's

166
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:23,900
do that going to say Okay print sorry print value entered is less or smaller than to make it consistent

167
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:34,100
with greater here and this is smaller than the random the generated value.

168
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,000
All right.

169
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,500
Looks great looks perfect.

170
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,120
Let's run that.

171
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,690
So when we're done it may tell you OK well values in the region enter the smaller than the random generated

172
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,330
number.

173
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,000
Why.

174
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,830
Because here you are comparing the 20 compared to 47 in this case.

175
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,070
Right.

176
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,590
So since 20 was actually smaller than 47 we only executed this on the right.

177
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,720
OK.

178
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,840
What we could do here to make a little of the code a little bit may makes sense.

179
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:06,420
We can actually print both values before going into the if condition we seeking every time going to

180
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,370
go ahead print.

181
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:17,540
And I'm going to say OK value view entered value entered is going to open curly brackets.

182
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:26,720
I'm going to say end randomly generated value is you know open another curly bracket.

183
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:34,300
And here I'm going to say if you guys remember a kid dot formats and we're going to pass along our user

184
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:41,610
value and our comp value which is simply here our comparison value our random integrated value is going

185
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,120
to be printed here.

186
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,250
And this is the user input.

187
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,190
We're going to be printed here.

188
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,160
If we read that again we're telling you okay your value you entered was 20 and the random generated

189
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,550
value was forty seven.

190
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:57,580
By comparing these two together the value entered which is 20 was actually smaller than the randomly

191
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,780
generated value.

192
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,200
Right.

193
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,910
It's make sure that that code actually works again.

194
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,910
Let's try it again.

195
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,770
Let's enter any value to say OK let's say 90 for instance let's enter.

196
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,420
Let's keep running.

197
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,570
So the value is 90 generate the random number the number is 36.

198
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,690
And let's run this one to Daniel will you.

199
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,990
OK value entered is 90 and generated value 36.

200
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,160
The value entered is actually greater than the randomly generated event which makes complete sense.

201
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,700
All right you guys can test that code like you know like hundreds of times if you want to just to make

202
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,410
sure that the code works.

203
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,770
And that's pretty much all what I have for the section.

204
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,520
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

205
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,870
And in the next section going to keep going and continue solving the rest of the problems.

206
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,600
See you guys in the next lecture.
