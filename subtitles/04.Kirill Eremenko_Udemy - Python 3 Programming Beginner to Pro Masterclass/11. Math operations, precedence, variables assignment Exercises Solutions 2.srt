00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,970
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:09,340
This lectures we're going to keep going and know continue the solutions of the exercise meaningful for

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,480
available assignments presidents and mathematical operations.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,970
So let's take a look.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,780
So here I am asking you to write a code that takes the dimensions of a cube.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,120
OK.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,430
Which is let's say a.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,630
And then paint its area and its volume right.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,310
Because we're able to figure that out.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,970
So we're going to find a value called a.

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,420
And I put let's say 20 into it and around it that will generate a nothing happened.

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,090
But I can check and go here and can view aids were there a quiz 20.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,720
Right.

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,420
And what I could do I get any took a couple of cells press a couple of cells.

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:49,340
And what I could do here is going to say okay area equals two it's six multiplied by a multiplied by

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,630
eight.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,170
Right.

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:56,610
So let's do it in a more simple basic way six multiplied by a multiply by a.

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,770
All right.

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,760
Looks great.

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,700
And I could think the area again and I can actually view it here to run it that will generate twenty

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,370
four hundred.

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,850
Alright that's okay.

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,720
Looks good for the volume okay.

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,460
What it could do then into volume is actually a CUPE or eight.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,520
Well I could do amnestic volume.

27
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,030
OK.

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,660
Equal to a very simple four times a again.

29
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,090
Times a.

30
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,320
In a very very simple form.

31
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:30,920
If I did that and if I wanted to view the volume around it that would generate a thousand which is basically

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,030
the volume of my cube.

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,460
If the side is 20.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,170
If I want to change the side and make it let's say here it's a whatever you know it's a two for example.

35
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,410
I don't have to go and do over all over again and just go and you know I run it and that will kind of

36
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,420
be in the update for me.

37
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,180
Give me the idea and then give me the volume afterwards.

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,200
All right sounds great.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,670
The next question that we have is I want you to protocol that takes a number and incremented three times.

40
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,530
Again you are free to choose whatever number you want.

41
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,320
OK.

42
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,210
But let's take a look.

43
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,120
So you're going to say okay X equals two let's say 40 k..

44
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,060
What do they they're to incrementally three times.

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,420
If you're going to get a call you can do it in two other two ways.

46
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,020
You can do it first.

47
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,190
You say okay X plus equals two three.

48
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:19,610
Right.

49
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,510
Which means dig the old X and see to it.

50
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,080
And the results we're going to be the new X which is 43.

51
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,830
If I do that and if I wanted to view X if I run it then I come up with 43 great extent I can actually

52
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,470
do with the other way around and say say X equals 240 right.

53
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:47,160
And I can say okay X or equals to X new plus 3 or 8 and then I can view X and that there will need 43

54
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,700
46.

55
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,570
Exact same answer.

56
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,920
That's one way of doing it.

57
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,200
The other way of doing it which is you know pretty very very simple.

58
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,690
You can actually go heat as well.

59
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,450
So okay I'm not going to the.

60
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:04,340
And then at plus one or I and they're going to come here at plus equals plus equals to 1 and then x

61
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,570
plus equals to 1 which is obviously we're not going to go there and I'm going to do this anymore.

62
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,820
He did just again because it's kind of you know the Absolute.

63
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,220
After the beginners bet they'll get 240.

64
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,260
Add one add one and one to it.

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,390
And if I run it again the exact same answer.

66
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,160
Which means it took the first X you know a day to become 41 to 41.

67
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,850
They did become 42 41 42 of they did become fully 3.

68
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,690
That's what we're going to do here.

69
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,320
All right why am i explaining it this way.

70
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,250
I mean spinning it this way.

71
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:40,100
Because in the future we're going to learn how to do for the loops and why loops which is you know where

72
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,980
you take that comment and sort of writing it three times.

73
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:50,030
I can just condense it in one comment that does it repeats whatever operation for us several times which

74
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,270
is going to come really handy really powerful in the future.

75
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,390
Right.

76
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,600
OK.

77
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,950
Let's take a look at the next example.

78
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,030
So the next example that we have here is I'm asking you what went wrong.

79
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,180
Headlines the code so that Z becomes equal to 50.

80
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,740
Actually let's zoom in a little bit on it.

81
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,450
So I'm asking yoki think the value of x equals 20 y equals 230.

82
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,510
And I'm asking you to tell me what went wrong.

83
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,910
Okay so let's say let's assume I don't know what happened here and Arun it would Daimyo case something

84
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,290
went wrong.

85
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,190
Name is not defined which means I didn't define what is a then an operation.

86
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,520
I say define X yes I define Y.

87
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,360
But then in the final key What's s and then find that.

88
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,920
OK so what I'm asking you to do is to simply go here and line.

89
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,430
Okay so simply define S.

90
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,430
OK so again and find S here.

91
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,460
Okay so the answer is going to become equal to 55.

92
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,630
So I know that if I add explicit Y that would need 50 right so let's define S and put 5 into it.

93
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,890
OK which means 20 plus 30 plus 5 which in the 55 if one and that then.

94
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,000
Nothing will happen because it plods Z.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,630
But if I create a cell here and it Z I around it then become a come up with the answer 55 which is basically

96
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,950
what I was asking you to do.

97
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
K I.

98
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,100
OK the next question that we have here is I'm asking you to write code that performed the following

99
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,420
mathematical operation.

100
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:28,330
I want you to simply deny the value of z and simply give the absolute of x minus y multiplied by x plus

101
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:28,800
why.

102
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,520
Okay.

103
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,150
All right.

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,420
How can we do that.

105
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,600
So if you get a call we have done let's say they find any valid values for x and y can say X equals

106
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,210
to four.

107
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,170
Okay.

108
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,060
They're going to say y equals two let's say two for example and they're going to say Z equals stew.

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,770
And what it could do to do absolute is if you call it was a B s just to do the absolute open brackets.

110
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,250
I'm going to say X minus Y.

111
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:55,900
OK.

112
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,230
That would be the first part.

113
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,810
And then do multiplication.

114
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,160
Can open the brackets.

115
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm going to say X plus Y.

116
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,060
That's basically writing the exact same equation as a guest can see it.

117
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,900
And then here we're going to plot Z to view what's inside there.

118
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,880
Let's try let's let's run it.

119
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,670
And that was a 12 gauge.

120
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:22,240
Which simply put Peter got forward minus two which becomes two and then multiply by six which is four

121
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,960
plus two.

122
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,650
And that will generate 12 for us which makes complete sense.

123
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,020
Right.

124
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,070
Great.

125
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:33,220
The next question that we have here I am asking you to basically go through these kind of you know lines

126
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,580
of code.

127
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,010
Again there's tons of information in here again and you wouldn't find this kind of common that in the

128
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,340
concept lectures I'm not going to cover all concepts here.

129
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,590
I'm just going to introduce for example in the exercise some new concepts where you guys can you know

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,630
do for example extend the research.

131
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,510
Okay.

132
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:56,440
So here kind of you know introducing a new concept for you guys in the exercise event are kind of some

133
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,090
restrictions in a very big naming.

134
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,850
You can just go in name very and whatever you want.

135
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,340
These are kind of the allowable names you can for example do underscore salary that works.

136
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,670
Yes that's not a problem.

137
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,940
Salary under score.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,240
OK.

139
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,010
That's not a bad salary one salary 2018 salary under the squawky.

140
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,180
You can do all these variables are you know valid.

141
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,630
They are look great.

142
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,870
If you do all of them you know kind of upper case that's fine.

143
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,970
But bear in mind that salary lower case is completely different variable compared to salary uppercase.

144
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,720
These are kind of represent totally different variables which means that you can go ahead and refer

145
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,490
to them again.

146
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,360
Okay.

147
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,060
We need to make sure that all the letters match.

148
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,230
Okay so will then that means you only fit into the exact same value.

149
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,810
Okay.

150
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,450
Okay.

151
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,550
What about the Big Nose Knows what you know what you should do what you should and do it should start

152
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,810
available with a number you can go and say okay let's see two salary that doesn't work or if you use

153
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,580
any of the reserved words in here.

154
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:03,100
So here we have kind of a list of reserved words which is simply put a couple of words that we are not

155
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:10,330
allowed to use like for example for from Twitter try while true.

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
Just don't use them.

157
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:11,800
Why.

158
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,690
Because they mean something else for Python Python just to use them.

159
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,110
You know the kind of differently.

160
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,280
Okay.

161
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,190
So I'm asking you to do here is to simply go through that code okay and try to see which one is allowed.

162
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,330
Which one is not.

163
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,720
And make sure the record run OK.

164
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,800
All right so all if we've done it you'd come up with your invalid syntax comes off.

165
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,990
Ed we're going to show up.

166
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay so first of all salary equals 20.

167
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,200
That looks great for me.

168
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,520
You know my problem is upper case salary equals 25.

169
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,540
Not a problem too.

170
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,920
But bear in mind this salary is completely different than this.

171
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,340
There's just totally two different variables.

172
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,820
I dare say for equal stenn.

173
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,250
Okay first four it's actually one of them is old words here.

174
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,470
So if you go up here you would see that Ford is here which is one of the reserve words which is kind

175
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,360
of you know not allowed to use and actually peiser on its own or an old book on its own which will highlight

176
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,900
it as green which means do use or right which means to do that you have two options either to deleted

177
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,880
or to do what with quality comment or commenting.

178
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,530
What in my comments so actually if you go ahead and do hashtag here.

179
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,880
And if you do space you'll see that the column has changed which means that basically this line becomes

180
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,650
a comment becomes kind of words that posted.

181
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,880
We're not going to be executing.

182
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,740
It's doesn't become a command anymore which means that the code we're going to go on to execute this

183
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,590
execute this come here.

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,340
Doesn't doesn't do anything just keep Do this do this looks good.

185
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,090
All right do it do this as well.

186
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,700
Looks good to me here.

187
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,610
Something is wrong.

188
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,580
What was it basically that we started that variable with number two which is again not allowed.

189
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,780
That's one of the stuff that we have not allowed to do is that we started a variable name with a number

190
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:06,150
we're not allowed to do this or you could do here can go and comment this gay or I underscore sandri

191
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,330
that works true equal 20.

192
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:08,760
Okay.

193
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,580
If you actually go up here you would see two as one of the reserved words you you're allowed to use

194
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,160
it.

195
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,950
So what it could do you're going to come here comment that out.

196
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,700
And Salad it underscored looks good underscored that it looks good to me.

197
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,030
Actually I do run it.

198
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,360
You will see again something is wrong but you would see that the wrong here has nothing to do with any

199
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,110
of that.

200
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,080
It's in the print comment which makes sense because here I am asking you to basically print something

201
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,440
that's not allowed anymore.

202
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,640
So I could and I copy this beast in here.

203
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,270
I'm going to go here.

204
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,200
Comment one of them which is kind of the given.

205
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,590
And I'm going to go here to remove the words that I had that I don't need to care for because they move

206
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,340
from here go here to move this one.

207
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,410
I don't need it.

208
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,710
We're go here move through.

209
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,190
I don't need it and all that looks great.

210
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:08,820
So if I were on this then you would come up with perfectly with the values 20 25 12 13 15 30 again here

211
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,450
we just cover print are going to show print simply now printed or stopped on the screen.

212
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,210
We can have lectured on print moving forward.

213
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,630
This just got kind of a quick exercise refresher for you guys to exercise their valuable naming and

214
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,280
which ones are allowed and which ones are not allowed.

215
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,410
All right.

216
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,650
OK.

217
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,930
Let's keep going.

218
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:35,640
So the question number 11 is I'm asking you to simply write a code that takes celsis temperature and

219
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,980
convert converted to fair and right.

220
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:44,520
So what I'm asking you to take celsis value multiplied by nine over five plus thirty two and that give

221
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,620
us an and hide value.

222
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,750
Okay.

223
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,140
So it could do here and say okay see for example the value of C which sense for Celsius let's call it

224
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,920
whatever let's assume it's 23 for example or let's say it's 20 or eight which is basically this value.

225
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,150
So simply when you run the code you should see that the result of the fair higher value is actually

226
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,760
68 which is the conversion that we're looking for.

227
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,690
So what it could do here basically is is going to add the exact same equation and say okay F which set

228
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,560
foot forward and height equates to nine divided by 5.

229
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,710
Multiply the answer by C right.

230
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,200
And then what it could do to add plus 32.

231
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,220
Let's make sure he took multiply this first which makes sense.

232
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,630
The answer again added to 32 looks fine.

233
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,850
And he knows it's going to show F which is what's and right and that right and that if Right and that

234
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,020
that would show me 68 which is exactly the same as we have here.

235
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,170
Looks great.

236
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,560
All right let's take another point.

237
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,230
Let's stay.

238
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,610
Let's say I think 40 degrees C in a go here.

239
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,330
Change it.

240
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:51,690
Make it 40 degrees C run it run it run it will generate 104 which is if you go up you'll see it's 144.

241
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:59,380
Basically this equation stands for the linear linear line equation simply OK.

242
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,370
So again the one to go into the mathematics of it but just you know here that's the intercept which

243
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,390
is you know like the intercept of the y intercept which is 3 two and that's kind of the slope of the

244
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,200
line which is you know the delta.

245
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,170
Why don't do X which is nine divided by five here.

246
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,780
And that's kind of the or the second conversion from Celsius temperatures to four in high temperature.

247
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,140
Again these codes are very useful.

248
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,450
Yes it looks simple but you can actually do it.

249
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:27,650
And you know like executed in reality like actually deploy it and use it for whatever application you

250
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,290
want.

251
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,750
Moving forward what I'm going to show you and show you how can we actually think that value is sort

252
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,640
of inserting the code.

253
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,250
I'm going to ask you moving followers to actually ask the users to improve that value so good as the

254
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,240
users to input.

255
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,670
What's the what's the temperature of today and the use it for this I think in a print the and hide value

256
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:53,980
for it more than for the last example that we have is asking you to write a code that converts from

257
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,180
kilometres per hour into miles.

258
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,620
But.

259
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,040
And I'm asking you to refer to this equation below again this is even simpler.

260
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,820
So you say okay kilometre per hour you can call it whatever you want.

261
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,870
And when I say let's say 90 which is you know like the value he they actually can see here let's say

262
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,800
it's 90 kilometres Brown.

263
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,610
What I could do.

264
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:20,260
Netsuke mph which sent from miles an hour per hour equates to exact same number point six to one 4.

265
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,440
Multiply this by kilometre per hour.

266
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,910
And then I'm going to show mph or a mile wide.

267
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:33,710
But if I am that one that done that that would generate fifty five point ninety to actually it looks

268
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,220
pretty.

269
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,240
This actual real This is actual like an old you value or even of you know image.

270
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,770
So here it is set our 90 kilometres per hour which stands for around 50.

271
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,750
This is 50.

272
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,460
Island 55 miles an hour which makes complete sense.

273
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,070
Let's take another example.

274
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,940
Let's go in and assume I'm going to do let's say pick for example want 80 kilometres for example I'm

275
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:01,010
going to say okay when 80 kilometres but our ground that saloum that on that that would generate around

276
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,390
111 miles per hour which makes complete sense.

277
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,180
Right.

278
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,510
Okay.

279
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,680
So again now we should be familiar with variables variables Simon's presidents and basic mathematical

280
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,720
operations.

281
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,420
Great job.

282
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,830
You guys should be proud.

283
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,860
I hope you guys enjoyed that section and see you in the next section.
