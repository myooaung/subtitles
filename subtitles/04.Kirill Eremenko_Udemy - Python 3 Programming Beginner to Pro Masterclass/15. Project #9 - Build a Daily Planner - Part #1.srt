00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:11,130
Hello everyone and welcome to this project and this project we're going to try to kind of practice about

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:19,830
how to use files how to get the input data from the user how to perform or use dictionaries how to do

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,010
for loops how to do if conditions and how to treat files as well.

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,810
Maybe access files or print data from the files so there's like tons of learnings in this particular

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,200
project.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,300
However this project is actually pretty easy.

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,790
It's pretty straightforward and simple and it's really useful too.

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:44,760
So what what I want us to do is we want it to assume that for example your university student and you

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,000
would like to develop a day planner.

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,820
OK.

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,950
So I want you guys to write for example a code that takes a user name and password from user and grant

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,170
or deny access.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,420
All right.

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,570
And if the if the password and the user name matches what we saw which is you know what we could still

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,350
going to be doing here storing that data here.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,100
Once the access granted the system we're going to request to get the time of the day from the user.

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:18,750
So from the users to enter the time of the day afterwards we are going to store within our program a

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,860
certain specific timeframes going to say let's say at 10:00 we have let's say programming lecture in

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,810
room 8 at 12:00 we have let's say computer vision lecture in Room C at let's say one o'clock we have

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
our lunch at the cafeteria.

21
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:42,300
It's kind of a day planner you are guiding yourself you know kind of you know like to attend for example

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,250
specific lectures.

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,240
It's kind of a reminder for you.

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,460
And what what we're going to do afterwards as well if the system were going to provide the user with

25
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,130
details on the lecture title and location which is you know what we've just discussed and as well we

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,100
are the software as well once we once the software decides which lecture is going to be going to be

27
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,430
selected by the attending they will as well retrieve lecture notes that we already stored before in

28
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,240
a text format scholar lecture notes not text.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,590
You guys will find that lecture note the text in here.

30
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:14,880
All right.

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,970
And the course package if you guys go here you will find that there is a file called lecture on this

32
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,220
called notes.

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,890
Right.

34
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,840
And here you will find that you know there is like lecture notes date 2016 Professor let's say Mitch

35
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,100
you know election one and it's kind of a coding exercise.

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,410
All right.

37
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,690
And basically you just wanted to retrieve that information so you can access it you know for the user.

38
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,640
All right let's get started and let's build some codes here.

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,320
Let's read some quotes before we read the code.

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,180
Let's take a look maybe at some of the code in action.

41
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,980
So here I am asking to enter user name so the user can enter Ryan and then password we're going to select

42
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,710
whatever Password please bear in mind that here the password in this case was actually didn't show up

43
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,550
for the user.

44
00:02:59,550 --> 00:02:59,820
Right.

45
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,300
That's very important point.

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,420
OK for the user name actually showed right for the password which I will try not to use kind of you

47
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,250
know like a very important and easy way to actually enter the password.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,950
And it sure will show stars.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,370
So nobody would actually look at your password and know it.

50
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:23,930
And if the user name and password matches the user name and password that we have in our database they

51
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,590
don't get a say Okay access granted.

52
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,040
Welcome to the system.

53
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,870
And we're going to ask as well.

54
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,280
What's the time right now.

55
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,050
So the user are going to insert the time between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. So let's say they use it until

56
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:42,560
it's a nine then the program again direct him to you should attend programming lecture room A.

57
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,060
And here you go.

58
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,590
This election notes.

59
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,150
All right.

60
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,330
Let's take a look at how can we build this.

61
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,360
All right.

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,390
First of all let's go ahead and

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,930
let's define our user name and password.

64
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,340
First we're going to say user name equals two.

65
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,940
You guys can call it whatever he'd say let's say user name is Ryan for example.

66
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:14,530
I'm going to set passwords and then say password equals to you guys can name it whatever you want here.

67
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,580
I'm going to call it let's say why S.K. percentage 1 2 3.

68
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:28,140
So this is the password and username that they use it has to enter in order to keep going in order to

69
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,370
actually grant the user access to the system.

70
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,730
All right.

71
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,820
So we're going to do here.

72
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,460
We're going to get the user name and password from the user.

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:48,870
So going to say OK let's input and we're going to ask the users to enter your username All right.

74
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:56,590
And we're going to take that and put it in input underscore username.

75
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:56,950
All right.

76
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,100
OK.

77
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,250
Looks good.

78
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,050
Let's as well get the password.

79
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,360
We're going to say input.

80
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,460
OK.

81
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,210
Underscore password equals two.

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,530
We're going to say OK.

83
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,960
Input and here we're going to ask him okay.

84
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:20,990
Enter your password.

85
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,780
All right.

86
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,040
OK.

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
Looks good.

88
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,250
Let's keep going.

89
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,680
And let's make a check here.

90
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,480
So he'd have just tried to fill out the easy part right.

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,080
Some say OK if you found a user name that the users had that saved in the system.

92
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:43,180
These are the seven system was equal to our input on the score.

93
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,180
Username.

94
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,730
Right.

95
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,380
Which is basically what the user have entered.

96
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,350
And so obviously the username and the past would have to match.

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:06:00,830
I was going to say input underscore password equals to the password right.

98
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,900
If these conditions happen I'm going to say Okay if that's successful I'm going to say Okay print

99
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,220
okay.

100
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,790
Access has been granted.

101
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,430
Welcome to the system.

102
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:20,990
All right.

103
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,740
Looks good.

104
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,990
Okay.

105
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,020
All right.

106
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,640
And then we'll go do something here.

107
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:26,960
Okay.

108
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,570
What if it doesn't happen.

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,030
Can take it.

110
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,880
Else if that doesn't happen it's printout.

111
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:40,130
I'm going to say well username for password is not correct

112
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,230
access denied okay all right.

113
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,720
Looks good.

114
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,040
Okay.

115
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,500
Let's actually give it a shot.

116
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,400
Let's see what's going to happen.

117
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Let's run.

118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,830
That's when we run it.

119
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,180
Introduce me to say Ryan for example.

120
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,870
Enter password.

121
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,200
Let's say I'm going to insert like random password 1 5 7 8 whatever.

122
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,880
Enter obviously the username and password did not match what we have here.

123
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,600
So we got user name or password is not correct.

124
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,250
Access denied.

125
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,500
Which is simply we didn't execute the body of the if we only executed the LS portion of the if.

126
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,840
Right.

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,850
Okay let's run it again.

128
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:25,370
Let's enter for example Ryan like this and let's match the password let's say why SDK percentage 1 2

129
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:32,470
3 run it well again it didn't graphing it didn't get me access it says username and password as well

130
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,010
is not correct.

131
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,200
Access denied to even though they use a name as it should be the same right but please bear in mind

132
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,090
that this is case sensitive right.

133
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,350
So we need to make sure that the key is that the first letter only is uppercase right.

134
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:53,880
So let's run that let's let's match it this time let's enter why is K percentage 1 2 3 run it's access

135
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,450
granted.

136
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,680
Welcome to the system.

137
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,570
Perfect.

138
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,810
OK now this is just the basic just the beginning.

139
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,720
All right OK.

140
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,530
What I want you guys to do here which is you know like we had we have an issue here with this code.

141
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,530
We haven't done anything yet but you we have an issue here and want to fix it.

142
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,030
So the issue here is that the password.

143
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,650
OK everyone can read it right.

144
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,680
So you can actually can read that the password why escape percentage 1 2 3.

145
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,640
What we want to do here is that we wanted to kind of you know do kind of a little bit of a check to

146
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,990
actually hide that password.

147
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:34,120
So what we could do we're going to say OK import get pass and get past we'll actually get to help us

148
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,490
tremendously actually showing the password getting the password without actually showing it on the screen.

149
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,480
So let's go ahead here and let's comment that out because we don't need it anymore.

150
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,340
Let's copy it.

151
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,990
It's basic here.

152
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,640
Take it input password equal and sort of input what we're going to do.

153
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,010
We're going to take a get pass DOT get pass.

154
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,130
That's it.

155
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,200
Once we do this let's try it.

156
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,430
So this enter user name.

157
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,850
He writes Ryan enter your password.

158
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,550
Is exactly what we have here.

159
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,610
And if we entered y SDK and that's the beauty of it if you just take a look here you will find that

160
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,380
there is no I can't read anything right which is pretty much what will happen in real world.

161
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,190
Right.

162
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,180
So let's read it again.

163
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:25,060
So we have Y this key percentage 1 2 3 strong it's access granted welcome the system and the password

164
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,740
does not show.

165
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,490
Which is amazing.

166
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,660
That's exactly what we're looking for.

167
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,350
All right.

168
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:29,980
Okay.

169
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,120
And that's pretty much the first step in building our code.

170
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,640
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

171
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,030
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

172
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,940
And the next lecture I'm going to keep going.

173
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,800
We're going to define our function.

174
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,060
We'll get to for loops if conditions.

175
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,160
Dictionaries we're going to do tons of stuff in the next lecture.

176
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,660
Please stay tuned and see you guys in the next lecture.
