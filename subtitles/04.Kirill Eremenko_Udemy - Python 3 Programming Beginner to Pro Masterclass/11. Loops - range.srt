00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:10,080
We're able to cover the basics of how to create for loops and in this lectures we're going to learn

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,230
kind of a very easy way of creating a full loop using a keyword we'll call it range.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,640
Okay.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,430
All right.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,090
So let's get a look first at what they mean by rains.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,650
So rain generates a list of numbers which is used to iterate over with for loops.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,730
So let's assume that I want to for example say to print numbers from 0 till 5.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,000
All right.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:40,200
So what I could do I'm going to say OK for i in range and here I can simply illustrate or iterate OK.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,820
How many numbers I'm looking for.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,090
So if I wanted let's say two print numbers from 0 to 5 I'm going to put here Number Six OK and bear

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,200
with me I know it might be a little bit confusing but this is just you know the way the way goes.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,610
OK.

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,070
That is actually two confusing points.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,340
All right.

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,100
So first I want to take it for i in range 6 and put column going to say Okay print.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,200
Go ahead and print I should enter.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,110
And here we go.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,040
So we're able to print simply numbers from 0 up till 5.

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,290
So the first actually there's two points.

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,530
The first point is for loops when we do four loops using the range actually we start with an index of

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,010
zero.

24
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,390
OK.

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,300
So the index here starts with 0.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,490
That's the first confusion.

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,120
All right.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,410
Obviously in our world you know like as humans say no starts with one.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,710
Right.

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,060
We don't.

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,200
We don't start with zero in general but that's what we.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,810
That's how we know the index he works.

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,000
So going to take it for i in range six then first of all we're going to start with zero index based

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,580
meaning the list index of indices starts with zero not one that's four step the next step is we go here

35
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,900
if we list six we're not going to actually print the value of six we're going to print up two and excluding

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:56,160
the value of six which means I'm going to print number 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 and not 6.

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,830
All right.

38
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,530
Again let's take a look another example.

39
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,890
Let's assume that I wanted to let's say print range 0 and 10 that will generate numbers again integers

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,500
from 0 1 2 3 4 up until 9 and not including the value of 10.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:10,810
All right.

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,680
I know it's strange.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,530
That's fine but that's the way it works.

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:13,890
All right.

45
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,840
So I'm going to ask you guys to please go ahead and maybe posit video and print numbers.

46
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,230
OK.

47
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,830
From I want to print numbers from zero to 14.

48
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,300
All right.

49
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,520
That's what I wanted to do.

50
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,290
I wanted to print numbers from 0 to 14 using again obviously arranged.

51
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,620
Please go ahead pause a video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,150
All right.

53
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,750
You guys were able to figure out the challenge.

54
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,900
What I ask you has to do is to print numbers from 0 to 14.

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,510
So simply you're going to take it for i in range.

56
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,830
And here are going to pass along and instead of because I want to 14.

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,980
Then he put 15 hit instead.

58
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,320
All right.

59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,410
And afterwards I'm going to take a print and print I shift enter.

60
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,160
Here we go.

61
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,420
See you print the number 0 1 2 3 up until 14 we didn't include the value of 15.

62
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,110
All right.

63
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,650
Sounds great.

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,740
OK.

65
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,500
So let's go ahead and maybe print numbers from 49 49.

66
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,050
So going to say OK print.

67
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,490
All right.

68
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,700
And I wanted to print I obviously.

69
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,170
OK.

70
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,250
And before doing that that will be the body of the four.

71
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,400
So going to say OK tab I won't say four.

72
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,650
OK.

73
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,380
Say i in range and I wanted to print numbers from four till nine.

74
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,720
So I guess a fourth till 10.

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,050
All right.

76
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,390
And put my column here.

77
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:31,970
Enter.

78
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,840
Here we go.

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,240
So now we'll be able to if we put for example range here with only single value that means I'm going

80
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,820
to start from the number zero.

81
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,120
All right.

82
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,340
And I will keep going up to and excluding the value.

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,930
However if I wanted to let's say put range and I put two values four to 15 that means I'll be printing

84
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,360
numbers starting from four going up to and excluding the value of 10 second printing four five six seven

85
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,700
AB until nine.

86
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,500
All right sounds great.

87
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,330
Let's take a look at another example.

88
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's assume that I wanted to print.

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,200
For instance let's say numbers.

90
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,900
OK that goes 1 3 5 9 and so on.

91
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,160
All right.

92
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,090
Let's see how can we do that.

93
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,480
First of all I take it for i in range.

94
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,160
And here I can pass along what I wanted to do.

95
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,600
They wanted to print numbers from 1 to 20 with a step of two.

96
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,640
All right.

97
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,030
OK that's kind of an even advanced form.

98
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,670
So again with using the word range you can use to kind of three ways of doing it.

99
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,030
First you can specify only one number and that should go from 0 up to and excluding that number.

100
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,460
Here you can specify range.

101
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,000
You can take it for till 10.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,680
That means are going to be printing four to nine.

103
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,750
Another way of doing it you can see it for i in range want to 20 with step 2.

104
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,800
What you could do let's go ahead and actually print I and see what's going to happen and as we're going

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,090
to get.

106
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,660
We're gonna get one and then because we were mentioning step two.

107
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,450
So each two numbers we can do a step.

108
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,120
So that's what we did.

109
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,190
We skipped number two so.

110
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,260
Okay one and then three and then five and seven and so on.

111
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,010
Up until nineteen.

112
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,330
All right.

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,890
Okay sounds great.

114
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,840
Let's go ahead and maybe take a look at one another examples.

115
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,260
All right.

116
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,560
And actually before doing that example let's go ahead and actually go do a little bit of challenge.

117
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,140
What I want you guys to do is to print numbers.

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,800
All right.

119
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,780
With a step from one to 30.

120
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,100
All right with the step of three instead.

121
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,420
All right.

122
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,040
So again I wanted to print numbers from one to 30.

123
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,660
With the step three.

124
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,190
All right.

125
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,410
Let's do this.

126
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,350
Go ahead pause the video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

127
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:45,800
All right.

128
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,550
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

129
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,350
We're asking us to do is to simply go ahead here and do pretty much the same that we have done in the

130
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:59,740
past when and take it for I in range and I'm going to pass along numbers from one till say 30 or 31.

131
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,830
And with the step of three.

132
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,210
All right.

133
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,880
So instead of Step Two before we're going to do step three.

134
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,160
All right.

135
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,200
And again come here and take a print.

136
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,810
I just enter.

137
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,620
Here we go.

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:18,140
So now I print one and then step it skip three then representing for 7 10 and so on up until 28.

139
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,800
OK.

140
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,510
If you wanted to maybe make it let's say print 31.

141
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,410
All right.

142
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,490
Maybe make it to 32.

143
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,050
And here we go.

144
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:25,940
OK.

145
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,130
So if you wanted to include maybe the note number thirty one for instance.

146
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,540
But obviously he'd want to print numbers from one to thirty two just going to stick to 30 here.

147
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,810
All right.

148
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,130
All right sounds great.

149
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,780
Let's take a look at one example.

150
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,640
For example let's assume that I wanted for example to let's say print numbers in a descending order.

151
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,300
So I wanted to print let's say numbers 10 8 6 4 and so on.

152
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,500
How can we do that.

153
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,020
Let's.

154
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,360
OK.

155
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:57,840
What we could do in a sec for i in range can pass along before here we started from a smaller number

156
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,450
going up to a bigger number right.

157
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,470
Well we could do here can do the opposite.

158
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,410
We're going to start from 10.

159
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,830
And I'm going to stop let's say at for example zero and I'm going to do a step of minus two.

160
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,380
All right.

161
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,400
OK.

162
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,120
When I say print print my value I should enter.

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,700
Here we go.

164
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,350
All right.

165
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,790
So what we could what we did here is that we went in in descending order.

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,670
We started from a large number 10.

167
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,850
And every time I'm going to go subtract values of two from each index I mean I say 10 and then eight

168
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,830
and then 6 4 and 2 and so on.

169
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,130
All right.

170
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,480
OK.

171
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,840
Sounds great.

172
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,730
Another way of actually doing it.

173
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,160
You can say OK for i n it's actually worth we'll call it reverse.

174
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,220
We're going to say reversed.

175
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,750
All right.

176
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,440
And you can pass along key range let's say number five for example.

177
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,640
And I'm going to go ahead and say print I shift enter.

178
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,540
And that's kind of a way of reversing kind of rates if I leave this range on its own it will go from

179
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,260
zero up to four.

180
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,010
But what I've done here with it reversed.

181
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,120
So they're kind of you know flip kind of the the the printing operation in a way it's going to say for

182
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,850
three two one zero and so on.

183
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,480
All right.

184
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,080
OK.

185
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,810
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

186
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,290
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

187
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,430
And this lecture we're able to kind of practice a little bit more on the reading the range keyword.

188
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,610
It's very powerful.

189
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:23,860
And if we saw if we can actually print the seeds of numbers starting from 0 up to and excluding that

190
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,150
value we're able to do that.

191
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,240
We had the mini challenge and we're able as well to go ahead and print instead of starting with index

192
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,860
0.

193
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,220
We can start let's say indexed for for example and this here and we're able to even step kind of you

194
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,320
know skip certain numbers by doing the step here.

195
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,700
All right.

196
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,390
And we have done kind of a mini challenge too and we're able as well to go in in a descending order

197
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:52,090
instead of ascending order by going from a large number and going down instead using the mining index

198
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,180
and or be able as well to use the keyword as well reversed.

199
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,400
If you wanted to print in a reverse hash in here as we have shown in this example.

200
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,370
All right.

201
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,350
Okay sounds great.

202
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,030
Keep it up.

203
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,970
You're getting better at it every day.

204
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,330
And next lecture we're going to discuss kind of an advanced form of looping is what we call it nested

205
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,290
loops.

206
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,730
All right.

207
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,470
And we're going to see as well kind of a little bit more advanced topics for the gods too for loops.

208
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,600
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
