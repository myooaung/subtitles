00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello everyone and welcome to this new election in the PBS lecture.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,060
We learned how can we deal with files mainly text files in this lecture.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,540
I'm going to show you how can we perform pretty much the same operations but on C as V files instead.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,630
Okay so let's see how can we do that.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,010
First step is where is my C V.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,020
Where's my C as a father might be dealing with.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,170
OK so he has to go back here.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,490
You will find again in the course lectures you will find.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,170
There is sample file in here.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,310
It's open it's Gates actually opening it opening up

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:35,990
all right.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,790
So here we go.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,040
That's my sample file.

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,180
So if you guys take a look at it you find that here there is a lot of information that is like First

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,040
Name Last Name emails.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,400
OK.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,510
That is like postal code the gender.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,430
And that is dollar value.

19
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,440
Maybe the salary of an employee or something.

20
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,360
OK.

21
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,930
Again this is just hypothetical you know like fake data.

22
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,330
Let's see how can we read that data and maybe many play that data using Python.

23
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,250
So first step what I'm gonna do when I say OK import CSB.

24
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,180
All right.

25
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,950
And then going to say with open and they need to specify the name of the file.

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,560
So here in my file was what was called Simple on this core file that C is V.

27
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,890
And they're going to open this as C as V file.

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,510
OK.

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,050
All right.

30
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,100
And now we pretty much have all the information we need.

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:32,070
So what we need to do afterwards when I say OK C is v dot reader.

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,640
And then here I open the file as quality as we file right.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,340
So get a good look.

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,190
Go ahead and actually read my C is v file and I have to specify the delimiter.

35
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,710
So Quito going to specify the delimiter as just a comma

36
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,580
All right.

37
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:57,670
And all that content I'm just gonna put it in let's say Red C as V information see as V information.

38
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,270
All right.

39
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,650
And what we could do afterwards we're going to say okay maybe take that information convert it into

40
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,260
a list.

41
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:10,350
So list we're going to take our reality as V and put that into data all right.

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,550
I know it sounds a little bit confusing but let's see what's happened here.

43
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:20,010
So first up as we went to the open seas we open simple file C as V and we opened it a C V or call it

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,830
as f for example you again you can call it F if you want.

45
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,550
Or maybe this can call it F if you want to avoid confusion.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,540
No we could do afterwards you could say okay see as v dot reader open read that file with the limited

47
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,720
equals comma and that would be our read C as V and then convert that Red C as into a list format and

48
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,700
that should be my data shift enter.

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,630
Here we go.

50
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,860
Let's take a look at our data.

51
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,230
Just enter.

52
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,390
And here we go.

53
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,610
So now we basically have kind of a list of lists right.

54
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,170
So we have a major or big list here.

55
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,690
And here we have lists inside the list.

56
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,990
This the first list that has the header here the list of all the first let's say employee second employee

57
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,880
third employee and so on.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,120
All right.

59
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,700
OK.

60
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,610
So let's take a look at.

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,640
That's basically how can you read the C as before.

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,590
Let's see how can we.

63
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:13,220
For example let's assume they want to take all these names and maybe create another list that contains

64
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,810
only the first name and last name.

65
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,760
That's a Noah moron or an for example like Nina Keller and so on.

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,610
How can we do that.

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,130
So what we could do we're going to say okay let's create a list that lips list we're going to call a

68
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,350
court full names equals to like just a new list.

69
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:37,460
And what we could do we going to say for row in my data and what I need to do with I need to go into

70
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,360
my data I don't want to go through all the data right.

71
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,070
I just need to extract information from here only.

72
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,800
Right.

73
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,180
So going to see from data from one till four.

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,520
OK.

75
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,810
First of all why did it go zero so I didn't go to zero because I didn't want to get the header right.

76
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,690
And when I stopped at four because I go up to and not including four.

77
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,370
So this is simply going to go here one two and then three.

78
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:01,760
That's it.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,680
OK.

80
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:11,150
So every time I'm going to go there I'm going to take full names which is my empty list here.

81
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,290
Every time I perform not a pen I'm going to append value to it.

82
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,760
So what I've got appending I'm gonna appending simply I need to append the first name.

83
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:30,700
Joseph let's say in Python for instance when I want to say OK I'm going to extract row of 0 plus apologies

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,490
plus then it maybe to add like a space or something and then add again another plus and then need to

85
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,100
add row of one

86
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,450
all right.

87
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,960
OK.

88
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,490
So when I say row of 0 first of all.

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,680
OK.

90
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:54,050
When I say row in data the word row contains all that information contains all that list.

91
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,000
So this is the first index zero.

92
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,520
This is one that is two three four and so on.

93
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,670
When I say row zero that mean Joseph space and then row 1 that means pattern here for instance.

94
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,270
And that's a shift entered.

95
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,280
Here we go.

96
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,450
Let's take a look at full name full underscore name.

97
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,470
And here we go.

98
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:19,070
So now we've been able to simply take kind of a c as we file read it in and actually be able to as well

99
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,700
kind of print all the first last name for its last name and so on.

100
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:22,940
All right.

101
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,680
So now it's time for a quick challenge.

102
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,820
What I want you guys to do is to simply go ahead and extract all the information let's say of the gender

103
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,640
in here.

104
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,210
So I wanted to extract male male and male for example.

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,780
OK.

106
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,910
Please go ahead pause the video and I'll see you guys after the challenge all right.

107
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,600
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

108
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,400
Let's go ahead.

109
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,630
Well one I what I ask you has to do simply go ahead here extract any column like the gender or dollar

110
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,070
or whatever.

111
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,520
So let's go ahead and accept actually the gender column.

112
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,800
So going to say OK so what we could do we could say let's say genders equals to let's say this afterwards.

113
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,030
Who could say for role in data from one to four.

114
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,640
It's exactly the same as before every time.

115
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,700
Take extract whatever information appended to the gender and say append every time I'm going to go here

116
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,230
and append information and want information to append it to go to row.

117
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,750
But I need to extract the elements in the 0 1 2 3 and 4.

118
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,080
All right.

119
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,390
OK.

120
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,880
Here we go.

121
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,050
Shift enter.

122
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,010
So now we're good.

123
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,900
Let's take a look at genders.

124
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,260
And male female.

125
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,490
OK.

126
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,700
Let's go ahead and maybe try.

127
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
For example the dollar value.

128
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,320
So I'm gonna say OK I need to do let's say the same stuff here so I make a dollar here.

129
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,180
I'm gonna create this and make it dollar

130
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,470
and I wanted to print the dollar and here instead of five I want to make it sort of.

131
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,810
So he lets count him again 1 0 1 2 3 4 and 5.

132
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,800
So that should be five minutes of the four shift enter shift entry would go.

133
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,970
Now we're able to accept all the standard information.

134
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,530
OK.

135
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,390
All right.

136
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,110
That's pretty much what I have for this lecture.

137
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,040
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

138
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,720
Keep it up.

139
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,140
Should be proud of your newly acquired programming skills.

140
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,690
Let's recap all of them so far.

141
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,260
This lecture I've been able to actually deal with CSB files we're able to actually open CSB files and

142
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:28,110
extract information out of it and we're able as well to maybe do some full looping and accept information

143
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,700
and with it kind of a mini challenge to extract specific data like dollar value and maybe the gender

144
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,390
values.

145
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,650
And that's pretty much all we'll have for this lecture.

146
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,560
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

147
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,750
And hope you guys enjoyed the section in the next lecture.

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,680
When I walk you through the exercises tons of fun we have tons of exercises ready for you.

149
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,930
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
