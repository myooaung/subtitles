1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's take a look at that additionals plots.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,220
Let's see how can we plot histograms or box plots so I could do here.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,880
Let's assume that we have a bunch of variables so we have let's say a list that has 21 22 23.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,940
And I wanted to plot a histogram histogram shows simply the frequency how many we get define basically

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,170
different bins.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,730
Anybody specify how many how many numbers fall within these different individual bins.

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,840
So yes you can do that then.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,940
First was specifying the number of bins.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,380
So a number of beans he is five.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,420
And here we did clot that hest for histogram he was specific Okay the X which is the variables and I'm

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,730
looking for specify the number of bints which qualify.

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,930
And then here you specify let's say the face column.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,200
Let's strand that.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,010
And that would generate this.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,510
So simply put it you don't need to actually go and do the mathematics for us.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,390
Just map plucked live you know end of the or the packages or the models that we have can do that for

17
00:00:59,390 --> 00:00:59,950
us.

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,920
Okay so here you specify again because you have five bins and you simply counted how many numbers fall

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,280
between this is year 20.

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,990
You plug them and so on and so forth.

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,670
OK.

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,810
All right.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,090
What if I wanted to change let's say the number of beans or chemical let's say 15.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,090
You look at this you'll see that that's how the how can change the number of beans if you can make this

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,640
for example from red to let's say blue.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,660
You can do it too.

27
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,870
You can make a blue.

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,920
You can again do tons of stuff with it.

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,920
Again it's pretty simple.

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,330
What you could do as well.

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,740
They can plot all of the box plots OK embossed plots.

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,170
You're just going to create kind of all I can ask for should data.

33
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,420
So I'm going to say OK I have data that has a mean mean mean distribution of 20.

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,260
And you have a standard deviation signal three and you're going to generate the data that has that mean

35
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,110
which is 20 sender deviation is what we call the dispersion from me.

36
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:58,020
How have disproved the data is the larger the standard deviation the more dispersed my data.

37
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:05,550
So the mean is 20 and they have all kind of the dispersion or extended deviation is around three around

38
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,850
me.

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,050
So we generate a simply random values here.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,140
That kind of ground that mean and send elevation can create the green beans of 30.

41
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,580
And in the UP of the histogram some in a plot histogram of X number of bins.

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,830
And I'm going to show the face colours.

43
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,880
And again call the y label n the.

44
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,550
And the title to.

45
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,330
If you're not that that one shouldn't generate and my histograms you would see that histogram Because

46
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,330
you specified Rent N which is normally distributed of ten thousand semples.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,520
That's why you get.

48
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,470
You get simply friend and enemy distributed data which makes sense.

49
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,360
The mean is 20 because the mean of the data is actually tending to make sense.

50
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,270
And you have a standard deviation sigma of three which really must make make sense to array.

51
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,900
And that's pretty much what we what we've got here.

52
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,180
So you have a number of bins of 30.

53
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,340
You plot a histogram and that's how can you kind of plot histogram as well.

54
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,210
This just kind of one other example of of a hue.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,990
Yes well he has specified the tidal.

56
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:15,050
And that's what we've got here for the tidal Gates is find the new 20 and send their version of of three.

57
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,240
Right.

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,750
Let's take a look at another type of plot which is what we call it kind of a bot plot.

59
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,780
Let's see what we what we have this.

60
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,870
If you run this would come up with basically this kind of kind of graph.

61
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,380
How can we get that.

62
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,650
So let's assume that we have angry create kind of a sÃ¨vres of some nucleate let's say dealer 1 which

63
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,530
is MP.

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:46,190
The trend them look normal normally is to build a 120 10 n 2000 so any 2000 dealer sets and they need

65
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,730
one.

66
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,790
The base of the mean is 120 and that's why you see the the platzman 120 Senden deviation of pretty much

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,200
10 what you could do here.

68
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,750
And again these are the arguments get me there send a deviation and then on the distribution end the

69
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,910
number of values desired.

70
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,480
How many semples how many data sets you're looking for.

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,540
You create again another data that has mean of 60 that's where you would see when you plotted it means

72
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,210
60.

73
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,700
You have a standard deviation of 30 that's what you're getting here.

74
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,410
And 2000 semples too.

75
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:24,600
Again people telling them that normal 70 20 and 2000 45 and that's 40 and 5 and 2000 if you create or

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,020
you concatenate all that data in one list and then you can plot it using basically the box plots if

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,660
you get you create a figure as we've done before and then Figg dot EB subplots OK.

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,360
You can assure him of that line you need it.

79
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,200
And then what you could do here and create an axes because he you specified one one one you simply first

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,220
subplot that has just one finger an image basically.

81
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,320
And here is spy X's DOD box plot.

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,490
That's where you actually pass along the data and we'll do the wasp plot for you.

83
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,350
And that's the box plot you ask.

84
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,650
You guys can see here it's really very simple.

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,740
Again if you let's say change this to let's make it two hundred.

86
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,990
And if you run it you'll see the data has been the meat has been shifted.

87
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,550
If you change that send a deviation to let's make it 20 you would see that basically that windu here

88
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,940
should increase rate.

89
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,180
If you run it you will see that actually increase because the standard deviation pretty much increase.

90
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,980
Okay.

91
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:26,020
And if you to take a look at what do you mean by basically in these this graph.

92
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,510
So simply here you plug kind of the middle of the median here.

93
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,090
You plot the Q1 and Q3 that's what you're getting here which is kind of one sigma.

94
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,910
And that's one of the standard deviation you can see and simply put this three sigma.

95
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:45,860
So Hugh what you're plodding here these two what we call a thief three quarter of percentile.

96
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,440
And that's all we're getting here and all these diets all these points outside.

97
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,190
That's what we call an outlier okay again.

98
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,450
Unless you're doing you know extensive statistics you're not going to be using the the book's plot.

99
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,700
He doesn't want to give you an idea of how powerful we can use map of lip on it.

100
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,050
The next figures in its image are going to be plodding we have a lot lots of plots.

101
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,510
So what we're going to do we're going to see the plotting.

102
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,370
Okay.

103
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,380
So what we're going to do is get import axes Cedi.

104
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,490
Okay full of 3D plodding and it's assumed that it wanted to plot let's say X versus Y versus Z.

105
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,750
Let's see how can we apply kind of a surface.

106
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,340
It's really interesting and very kind of beautiful to plot a way you could do this and say okay I'm

107
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,560
going to create a figure of plot figure and specify the size you and then he's going to create an axis

108
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,280
basically.

109
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,670
And what we're going to do here are going to create these the deed and wanted to plot and he can specify

110
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,190
these cataloguing equality.

111
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:51,160
And when I plot axes Well xii's you can call it whatever dots care and pass along my values my the dealer

112
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,610
then wanted to plot you know going to best along X Y and Z.

113
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,620
And he going to specify the collar angle as specify the Micro's too.

114
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,400
And you can specify the labels as well.

115
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,040
That's blood that's and that's what we're getting.

116
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,210
Pretty interesting.

117
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,800
So you can actually view the data in a 3D format which is zeni powerful too.

118
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,030
All right.

119
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,430
If you wanted to change for example that blue and make it let's say red.

120
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,350
Mean then didn't see the markers.

121
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,260
No I did not make it.

122
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:21,350
Just keep it to keep it as it is and it's a safer that me change the size and make it let's say 10 by

123
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,560
10 and it's plug that.

124
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,270
That's what I get and give a little bit smaller and the dust becomes becomes stripped away.

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,740
What if I wanted for example to plot say well look at the way it's free.

126
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,380
Okay.

127
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,680
It's tough to explain it before actually viewing it.

128
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,940
So let's run the Alpha and the code and can explain it after it.

129
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,470
So if you're on the call do you come up with this what we call it a wire wire.

130
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,590
Wondering which side of you are plugged in the dealer in a 3-d format but has the kind of a white and

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,250
that is really pretty and through that kind of you know like I had to have like plot you know like go

132
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,460
for a presentation or something it's really powerful too.

133
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,500
And then here you have a plot the 3D 3D and I'm going to do specify the figures size specify the subplots

134
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,530
and I'm going to do here and say okay axes Cedi dot get test data point or fire.

135
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,800
That's just to get the data.

136
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,120
OK.

137
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,920
That's going to offer some test data.

138
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,680
If you have your data you can simply specific it that's my X That's my why there's Maisie an order to

139
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,130
call or deploy the wireframe you can use the Xs dot plot underscore the wireframe and then you can specify

140
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,940
Okay this Pipettes along with X Y and Z.

141
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,670
And here you go specify the stridency stride.

142
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,170
Let's assume that I make it let's say from 20 make it to hundreds for example and plot it.

143
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,140
You'll see that simply here it becomes a little bit smaller as you can see here.

144
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:49,340
If you make it let's say go back to 20 and that's what we're getting a little bit more details if you

145
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,550
make it let's see the seas try to make it a hundred.

146
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,000
You get again.

147
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,780
You will see that we dropped lots of lines in here.

148
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,540
Again that's kind of you know we can use depending on the dealer that you are plotting.

149
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,170
And that's where we going to using the plot underscore why free or it's.

150
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,390
One more one more plots let's actually plotted first and then go back and see what it would mean actually

151
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,680
to come up with these you know kind of pretty pretty graphs.

152
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,480
So in order to do that you need to create what we called the mesh grid.

153
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,210
Okay.

154
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,510
So in order to do it you need to define again X get you to the final why you wanted to create a mesh

155
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,700
grid out of ex-wife.

156
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,680
It's kind of like creating a grid in it each of the intersection of this grid a plot something in the

157
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,250
z direction.

158
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,210
So here we specify the key.

159
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,610
We're going to call a range of x and y.

160
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,860
We create n.p. from nump by mesh Dritte that would create our mesh see have no x and y that's kind of

161
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,810
a mesh.

162
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,710
And then he can plot whatever you want in the z direction here.

163
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,450
The actual plotting the sign of the square root.

164
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,910
X squared plus Y Square again it's kind of you know it's it's contained within the Python library map

165
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:04,370
gotlib library but you can do tons of activities just look you know look at it look up messengered and

166
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,470
Python you can you can do what one does with a concealer dozens of pretty graphs just give you kind

167
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,420
of an example.

168
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,640
Again it would be only going to be using vison actually in this actual course.

169
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,090
This one I'll give you an idea of how powerful these librans could be.

170
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,480
So here you can see a x and y npe The mesh grids.

171
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,860
You create the mesh.

172
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,410
And here you create you specify the function that you wanted to plot in the zede rection and then you

173
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,750
specify again you want to plot X's dot plot surface.

174
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,560
That's what you're going to get X Y and see and he to specify the coloured map.

175
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,850
You ran it again.

176
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,920
That's what we're going to get.

177
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,220
Pretty pretty interesting.

178
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,270
And the final plot they were going to be showing is were collop pipeline.

179
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,940
If you wanted to create kind of a pipeline showing a different kind of kind of portions within the pie.

180
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,250
OK.

181
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,860
It's kind of it's very valuable in when you're running for example different presentations or kind of

182
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,120
you know like a somebody of a it is very helpful except different values 2055.

183
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,410
This kind of a percentage.

184
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,710
Okay so then it's some up to 100.

185
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,330
Did you have different colours green red yellow.

186
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,680
How do you suppose the final got explode.

187
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,270
We wanted to for example emphasize specific let's say pie within the pipeline.

188
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,900
Know make it let's say stand out I'm going to say what do you mean by that.

189
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,950
And here you have lithic a couple of countries.

190
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,290
Egypt United States Canada China Europe that's kind of the labels.

191
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,210
And what you could do they can create the pipeline out of it.

192
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,380
You can see the pie.

193
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,740
You can specify the values some of the values.

194
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,150
That's kind of how you divide your pie.

195
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,000
You can find the colours which is what we have.

196
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,090
You specify the labels which is you know kind of the country's going to be plodding and explored if

197
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,250
you wanted to have nor certain section are going to be coming out of it.

198
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,300
Let's say on it and that's what gets political.

199
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,610
Countries that seem pretty much tidal that we have here.

200
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,330
And that's what we got here.

201
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,560
So these are the different percentage associated with the counties you have 20 to say for example Egypt

202
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,960
three percent for example for Europe.

203
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,230
That's what we're getting here.

204
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,060
And because we selected explodes for the last one.

205
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,290
That's where you see Europe coming out of it.

206
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,980
If you want to make this for example point five that would show that you are actually supporting you

207
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,280
know the empire you stipulated the United States is the second one here.

208
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:25,350
You separated it you make it look kind of you know out of the out of the room or emphasize emphasis.

209
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,770
I put more emphasis on it.

210
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,630
That's pretty much how can you plot your pie.

211
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,270
I.

212
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,620
And that's pretty much what I have for this section.

213
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,910
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next section.
