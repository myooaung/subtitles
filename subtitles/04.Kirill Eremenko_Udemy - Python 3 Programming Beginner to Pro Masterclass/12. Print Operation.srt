00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,330
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,700
We're going to discuss the print operation and how to get data from the user using the Input comment.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,490
All right.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,840
These kind of you know two concepts they are very kind of important because that's how you get to you

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,440
know like develop a python code that can interact with a user.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,470
They can actually print something to the user and get data as well from the user.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay which is pretty interesting.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,860
Now we can actually take you know kind of you add code to the next level and do like greaney Fun stuff

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,580
with it.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,690
Okay so now we are at two a.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,120
Which is in the concept section and we are covering the print operation and how to get user data as

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,430
well.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:45,660
Right.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,840
Let's take a look.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,340
So let's assume that we wanted for example to print let's say you know like a welcome message to to

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,300
a user.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,720
What I could do is say okay X equals two whatever value then you open your open double quotes and then

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,480
you say okay let's say welcome to python on.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,450
Great.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:06,900
Right.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,170
So you have done here that you find available and you put basically these kind of characters within

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,450
that very case if you're on that.

23
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,670
And if you actually go here and say X what's x that will tell you Okay that's actually x contains Welcome

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,990
to my course.

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,850
If I wanted to get the type actually of X right you didn't cover that yet but are going to been covering

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,380
the future if I show that it would show you its actually string.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,310
S T R stands for string.

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,250
So now we know that there is an integer which is you know kind of if you put let's say X equals 10 we

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,360
know that there is float.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,700
If you put let's say X equals let's say 10.5 For example when there is a fraction an element or here.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,150
If I wanted to show shortest string value which is kind of a series of characters you get Again the

32
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,380
objective of this.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,710
Basically section is not to convert the strings because we're going to have a separate section completely.

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,520
Just converting strings and all the same methods.

35
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,680
But here I wanted to simply show you how can we print beida on the screen.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,380
So to print data on the screen we're going to use to confuse the print case we're going to do print

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,690
open parentheses and then you get a list X..

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,590
Which means of asking Python to actually plot or print whatever the value of x to the screen.

39
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,100
If I did that then you would find that the actual text you'd welcome to Python course without the double

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,590
quotes.

41
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,880
This is very important actually just containing what's in between here.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,410
We're going to be printed to history Alright.

43
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,610
Okay great.

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,080
That's pretty much how can we print data just print up a bracket and just print whatever you get.

45
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,130
So the next consider that I wanted to basically introduce some of the format method.

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,880
OK let's assume that one or two yes print data on the screen.

47
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,350
Let's see.

48
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,400
Welcome to python of course.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,840
But I want it little say to specify a name.

50
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,160
I wanted to say welcome.

51
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:08,130
Let's say Mitch for example to python of course or welcome let's say Ryan to a python course the welcome

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,560
whatever whoever he is.

53
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,310
Okay how can we do that.

54
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,030
How can we kind of you know this kind of break of that trained and insert data in between.

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,380
In order to do that we're going to use the format method simply to do this.

56
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,460
Let's take a look.

57
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,080
Let's assume that it wanted to print for example a welcome message based on a specific name.

58
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,370
Okay so going to say a meme I'm going to put let's say whatever name you can insert your name forwards

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,460
in Peter's is going to insert Mitch for example.

60
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,090
So he's going to define a very record name and put Mitch into it.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,200
Right let's run it and let's view what's inside anning for it.

62
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,010
It tells me actually there is much inside me.

63
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,690
OK sounds good.

64
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,490
Now I want it to print a welcome message too much to do that I'm going to make it print.

65
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,950
Open brackets apprentice's and then I'm going to do here.

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,480
I'm going to say Okay double quotes as it were done before and write your welcome message we're going

67
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,710
to say welcome and I don't need to put something because no need to put the name I'm going to show you.

68
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,940
How can we do that.

69
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,050
Welcome something key to this let's say python on course.

70
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,820
OK.

71
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,100
The whole idea here is I wanted to print something in order to do that.

72
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,920
Python has what we call it format format method.

73
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,500
OK what you could do here is that you can put kirrily brackets.

74
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,930
OK so if you put these brackets.

75
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,310
OK.

76
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,600
It's kind of a way that telling python that okay you print whatever message.

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,440
Welcome to this python course here.

78
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,340
Cake and whatever.

79
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,240
Here in this county bracket just put something in there and then appestat along just kind of separately

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,920
using a different method.

81
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,650
It's all quality format method.

82
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,340
OK OK it looks strange but once I tried it it would show very well.

83
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,910
Sure that's actually pretty simple to do here.

84
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,620
Going to the god dot format.

85
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,300
Okay so after the Colts see Dot format.

86
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,630
They're going to open parenthesis again.

87
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,990
I'm going to pass along whatever name that I wanted to list here.

88
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:13,060
So this basically what I'm saying telling Python to do is escape welcome within the brackets just pass

89
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,760
along the mean whatever values just come here and put it here in these two really brackets and they

90
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,130
continue along and say Okay to this by some quotes and that's it.

91
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,190
OK let's run it.

92
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,920
And you would say that's actually that's exactly or expecting.

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,140
Welcome mecham this thing course if I go here and say let's change it to let's say Ryan for example

94
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,720
and that did on that and there will say this.

95
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,550
You're welcome Brian to this python course.

96
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,070
Perfect.

97
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,750
What's even interesting is that you can actually use the fortinet method to print numbers as well so

98
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,080
I can say Okay welcome for example.

99
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,640
You know like or say for instance my name is Ryan for example and I am let's say 20 years all of 25

100
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,820
years or whatever.

101
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,490
Let's see how can we do that.

102
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,460
So what we could do here I mean to say okay print cake or print printing these and what we could do

103
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,410
is say okay double quotes and say Write whatever you want.

104
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:10,060
My name is an open croner brackets because they need to list here's something I'm going to show it again

105
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,960
after the format Okay.

106
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,430
And I am whatever the result.

107
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,540
Okay.

108
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,560
So now I know they're going to print are going to do something here.

109
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,050
Right.

110
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,850
And then a spatz Along something here.

111
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,430
So I'm going to use a format method to actually do this with this.

112
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,670
Dot format right.

113
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,630
I'm going to open parentheses.

114
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,740
I'm going to pass along.

115
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,190
I need two pairs in Maine and they want to pass an age as well.

116
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,400
So I'm going to pass a name or eight N bracket comma.

117
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm going to say person on the H but it then in the the agent.

118
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,940
So what I could do to go here create in you again press a and cell and define an age let's say 23 for

119
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,330
example.

120
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,520
And let's say again to go back and change the name make it let's say Mitch back again.

121
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,180
And that's it.

122
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,190
That's pretty much it.

123
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:03,440
So you can see here he can pass along an integer printed in print as well as string if you want to.

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,160
Let's take a look let's run this first name.

125
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,150
So now I have named Mitch right here that would print just welcomed me to this course.

126
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,260
Now I wanted to print a different one you're going to say age 23 and I say print.

127
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,190
My name is whatever and I am whatever it is old that's from that.

128
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,580
And that's it.

129
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,850
That's pretty much what we're expecting.

130
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,410
My name is it's a mess.

131
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,120
And I am 23 years old which is great.

132
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,810
Now you can pass along whatever you can she make it 25.

133
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,770
Run it through it.

134
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,700
Then you see that becomes 25 years old cake again the format message we're going to be using it extensively.

135
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,090
It's actually very very powerful.

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,030
I'm going to use it throughout the course to print you know mix of strings mix of numbers mix of floats

137
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,350
mix of whatever stuff we wanted to print.

138
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,050
Perfect.

139
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,560
Let's take one last example before we conclude the print.

140
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,090
Let's assume that you wanted to print the value of pi.

141
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,450
A few of us are familiar with the value of pi which is three you three points one fourth of that we

142
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,460
use generally when we can give you three for example of a circle.

143
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:02,870
OK.

144
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,240
Which there is actually there's a date it's called Pi Day.

145
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,650
OK.

146
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,710
It's what we could do here going to say okay I want it to print let's say print open parentheses.

147
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:19,230
Okay I'm going to say okay the value the value of pi is an open curly brackets.

148
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:25,840
And here you're going to see a dot after the article because in a dot format or brackets I'm going to

149
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,880
pass along the value of pi which is that's a three point one for you.

150
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,900
Based on whatever you want k for and that's they tell me the value by is 1 4.

151
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,400
Perfect.

152
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,030
That's exactly what I was expecting.

153
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,710
All right.

154
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,880
And again let's go ahead and refresh again.

155
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,170
Now we know how can we define a string.

156
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,610
How can we go here and print an actual string.

157
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,250
OK.

158
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,720
Sorry Hugh can pressure print the value chain here and we know how can we use the format method to pass

159
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,390
along a name with the string.

160
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,090
How can we print imane along with the age for example using again the curly brackets and the format

161
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,860
method.

162
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,040
And again another example of to plot the pipe and alright.

163
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,420
That's pretty much all what a half with the section.

164
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,980
I hope you enjoyed it and in the next section we're going to cover how to get data from the user or

165
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,080
a and see you guys in the next letter.
