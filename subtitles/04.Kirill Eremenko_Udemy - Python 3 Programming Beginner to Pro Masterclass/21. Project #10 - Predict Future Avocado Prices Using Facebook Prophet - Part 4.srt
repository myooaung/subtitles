00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,270
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,370
We're going to repeat pretty much the what we have done before which is simply trying to get the data

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,370
make prediction in the future and try to plot the data as well and see what's the trend of the price

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,660
of the avocado over the lifetime over like twenty nineteen for instance.

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,870
But what we're going to do here which is you know we even more exciting here we looked at the data previously

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,580
for the entire U.S. market.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,090
So we use the data for the overall data.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,310
Right.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,460
OK.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,720
So what we could do here.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,320
What we're going to do here we're going to select a specific region.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:37,850
OK.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,210
We're gonna select specific region.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,830
So just kind of a subset of data.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,140
You guys remember let's go up and let's review the data.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,330
So if you remember that's actually plotted here again.

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,980
You know what you're going to say OK let's view the data.

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,820
So we're going to go ahead actually and repeat the entire exercise kind of review for the previous one.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,770
So going to say I'm a hit I'm just gonna copy paste as much as I can because we have done that discuss

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,890
that before.

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,800
So again here we going to see as we figure out what is going to be the entire.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,910
Again we can go ahead here and view the data.

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,100
That's my beautiful data.

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,990
We have the dates and I have the average price because remember and here have the reason right.

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:24,030
So what I need to do here I need to plug the data and actually apply my profit predictions for a specific

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,060
reason I'm not gonna do it for the overall you know like data that we have.

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,060
OK.

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,130
So what we're going to do here we're going to take a subset of the data.

29
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,770
OK we're going to take specific section of the data and create another data frame.

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,380
So going to say OK I'm gonna get go to Africa to underscore data frame on the score sample and we're

31
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:51,480
gonna go ahead and get I've got to underscore the data frame and here we're just gonna get specific

32
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,940
elements was just just the data points that are related to let's say specific region let's say West

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,330
to the U.S. whatever.

34
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,130
Okay let's go to avocado underscored data frame and what I'm going to do here I'm going to pick region

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,890
when the region equals equals to West All right.

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,900
It's one that's K looks good.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,350
Let's take a look at the sample.

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,910
Let's run it and that's our data here.

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,610
Let's go back to the region.

40
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,900
You'll find that all of the region here is West which is exactly what I'm looking for.

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,680
All right.

42
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,160
Perfect.

43
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,680
OK let's go ahead and sort by date.

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,300
It's exactly the same as we've done before right.

45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:44,350
So going to think of avocado on this quarter frame on this core sample right equals two again to underscore

46
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:51,430
their frame and this core sample but we're going to sort of they're going to see sort underscore values

47
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,840
by date.

48
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,250
Right.

49
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,220
OK.

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,510
So that looks good.

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,640
Let's take a look at the data sample now.

52
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,540
And here we go.

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,570
So if you take a look here you will find that simply you went in and an ascending order kind of thing

54
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:15,250
the data starting from January of 2015 going up you know eleven twelve of January as well.

55
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,000
And then February and so on.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,660
So it looks like the data looks good.

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,970
If we scroll down the most up to date data was actually 25 25th of March of 2013 which is pretty pretty

58
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,270
good decent.

59
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,020
All right.

60
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,700
So what we could do next.

61
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,560
Let's go ahead and actually view the data.

62
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,960
Let's take a look at the you know like the trend in prices for a specific region only.

63
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,910
All right let's do put BLT the plots and I'm going to do I'm going to say OK avocado underscore data

64
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,350
frame on the score sample of date.

65
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,900
Right

66
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,280
OK.

67
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,690
And I'm going to plot the exact same thing as well.

68
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:01,060
So I've got to underscore that a frame on this core sample and here I will get a pass along the average

69
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,480
price all right.

70
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,110
Looks good.

71
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:05,990
But some that

72
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,010
and here we go.

73
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,030
That's the trend.

74
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,610
So again was hovering around like let's say one dollar going up one point seventy five going up and

75
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,810
down and went up to let's say 250 which is crazy.

76
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,650
People went crazy about avocados actually like you know even even myself like you know like it just

77
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,940
everyone was eating it.

78
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,030
The avocado toast across men like among millennials and stuff.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,950
So maybe that's what's happening here.

80
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,740
And then it goes you know popularity maybe went down a little bit.

81
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,560
You know when they realized the price actually pretty high.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:38,920
All right.

83
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:51,870
And let's actually change as well the size or BLT dot figure and we'll take a fig size equals to Let's

84
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,140
make it 10 and 10

85
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,000
right beautiful.

86
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,620
That's our graph as well.

87
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,200
Perfect.

88
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,590
Let's go ahead and again do the training if you guys remember.

89
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,290
Again I'm going to go against you all the time.

90
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,290
See this again.

91
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:16,340
First let's let's actually stop here for that specific lecture and in the next lecture is to have an

92
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,680
intellectually dedicated for training.

93
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,780
We're going to go ahead.

94
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,640
We're going to rename the columns.

95
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,150
We are going to do the predictions.

96
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,820
OK.

97
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,560
I hope you guys enjoy that lecture and see you in the next lecture.
