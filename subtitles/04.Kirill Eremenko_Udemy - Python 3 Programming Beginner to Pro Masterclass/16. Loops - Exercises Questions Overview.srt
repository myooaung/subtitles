00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the PBS lecture.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,580
We learned how can we do if conditions in Python and in this lectures.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,890
We're going to walk walk you through the questions related to the exercises for four and while loops.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,350
OK so in this lecture I'm just gonna walk you through the questions and in the next video I'm going

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,050
to walk you through that through the detailed solutions.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,690
So please make make an attempt to actually solve these questions if you can't or if you don't get stuck

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,000
that's fine don't worry about it.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,290
Again these levels please bear in mind that these levels are intermediate levels.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,660
They are not beginners anymore.

10
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,750
OK.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,130
All right.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,190
So let's get started.

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,640
So here I'm asking you to tell me what will this code generate.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,720
OK so here we have it lists my phone iPhone BlackBerry Samsung and Google.

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,240
And here there is simply a why loop.

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,480
OK.

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,450
And it seems like you know what kind of printing for example that list and that is kind of a condition

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,230
here that you know like might stop it at some point or something.

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:11,590
So that's I'm asking you without running the code please tell me what do you expect to see when we when

20
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,100
we run the code.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,270
OK.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,460
The next question is I'm asking you to write a code that display all numbers from 1 to 20 using while

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,640
loops and for loops.

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,700
So that would be a great kind of exercise for you guys to practice why loop and for loops and that would

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,260
be kind of the expected results.

26
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,150
So here we're expecting let's say 1 to 19 and you're expecting 1 to 19 as well.

27
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,010
Obviously you can adjust it and make it want to exact 20 hit.

28
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,130
I mean just excluding 20 years or so from 1 to 19.

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,010
All right.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,390
The third question is I'm asking you to write a code that generate the following table.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,260
I want to try to code that generate basically number 1 1 1 for instance and if it's two it seems like

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,780
you know the second number is kind of you don't like like the first number square and then here this

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,640
number is kind of you know looks like the first number cube.

34
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,740
That's the overall idea.

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,500
I want you guys to do it and kind of to print that table for us.

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,720
Question for I'm asking you to create it rolling dice game.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,200
The game should assume two dice either number one and two are being thrown and the random number is

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,590
generated every time the game should prompt the user to ask if he or she would like to keep playing

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,370
or not.

40
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,070
So this is basically what we're expecting to see.

41
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,170
So I'm expecting to see OK rolling the dice.

42
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,180
Please wait and hear rolling result for Dice one should be whatever random number.

43
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:42,160
So obviously we're going to use a random kind of library or package to generate random integers from

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,070
1 to 6 for Dice 1 and for those 2 and then it seems like you know we're going to be stuck in a loop

45
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,900
somehow because I'm going to be asking the user all the time to do you want to roll again or do you

46
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,980
want to play again or not.

47
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,750
And then you have to enter yes or no.

48
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,500
2 Just keep going.

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,480
Or two exits.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,770
All right.

51
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,700
Question five I'm asking you to develop a code that printout the multiplication table the quote you

52
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:12,580
from the user to enter the maximum number to be printed which is no going to be from 1 till 9.

53
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,520
So basically when I ask the user to enter number ok whatever number so he'll enter number between 1

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:18,880
and 9.

55
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,430
So the user let's say enter eight and then this is basically the table that I'm looking for my apologies.

56
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,900
This is a table I'm looking for eight times one eight eight times two 16 and so on.

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,260
So basically you take whatever number they use you will enter and multiply it by series of numbers from

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,080
one to 10.

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,050
All right.

60
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,160
Question 6 I'm asking to write a code that takes the maximum and minimum limits from a user and printout

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,510
of the even numbers only between the provided range.

62
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,780
So I'm asking you to enter a number lower bound let's say 20 upper bound let's say one hundred and then

63
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,720
here I'm just printing the even numbers only 20 22 24 26 and so on so forth.

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,990
Question 7 What does this code generate.

65
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,660
So it seems like there is a for loop and there is you know kind of an if condition in here that kind

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,940
of breaks the loop or continue the loop at some point and I'm asking you to without running the code

67
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,680
to please tell me what do you expect this code to begin to generate.

68
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,240
All right.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:25,130
Question 8 actually have tons of exercises and and this I believe we have we have actually sixteen sixteen

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,200
exercises so that's a lot.

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,540
So let's go back again to a question 8 I'm asking to write a code that takes a list of temperatures

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:40,310
from a user and convert them from Celsius to Fahrenheit for example the user will enter a list of temperatures

73
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,880
in the greasy they'll be separated by space.

74
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,670
So let's say 30 40 50 and 60.

75
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,030
And basically what the code we're going to generate will generate something like this temperature.

76
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,780
Are temperatures in degrees and Fahrenheit we're going to be like.

77
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,040
These are all the temperature in degrees C and these are all the temperatures in Fahrenheit.

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,850
Obviously you can google the equation but we have done that before in the past.

79
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,420
How can we convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

80
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,600
Question number nine we're asking you to create a password generator that takes the required password

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,590
length from the user and generate a password.

82
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,200
The password should should have the password should be a make the mix of characters numbers and special

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,150
characters.

84
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,620
For example I'm asking to enter the lengths of the passwords to say it's 20 and then this basically

85
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,950
going to be generated.

86
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,740
Again it's this is a little bit tricky.

87
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,950
You need to do kind of an extend research on how can you actually generate these like random random

88
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,710
numbers.

89
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,760
All right.

90
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:47,830
Question number 10 I'm asking theoretical takes a string from user and sought the words and print all

91
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:53,450
words afterwards so simply using an answer for example like you know like like a sentence so I answered

92
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,140
that let's say I'm so happy learning Python today.

93
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,450
And then he would sort it like this.

94
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,010
This is uppercase right.

95
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,180
So that's why it has been sorted separately.

96
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,740
And then a H L P S and T.

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,070
So basically are or ordering them in an alphabetical order basically.

98
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,590
Okay.

99
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,790
All the words that they used were going to enter Question Number Eleven print the corresponding elements

100
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,390
in both lists between using below.

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,430
Sorry using two different methods.

102
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:33,040
So I wanted to print black iPhone black Samsung that black BlackBerry white iPhone white Samsung white

103
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:42,220
BlackBerry gold iPhone gold Samsung and gold BlackBerry actually here in this case let me let me show

104
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,390
you the list.

105
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,500
Actually this has should be here.

106
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,750
So that's actually the list.

107
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,020
OK.

108
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,360
So that will be provided within the question.

109
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,420
And I'm asking you to basically print the combination of all of them together using two different methods.

110
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,260
OK.

111
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:02,420
Think of it as kind of you know doing nested loops OK and using as well.

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,820
List comprehension as well.

113
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,080
OK.

114
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,460
All right.

115
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,260
The next question.

116
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,420
Question 12 I'm asking to write a code that takes a string and calculate the number of upper and lower

117
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:22,540
cases characters in whatever word you enter or sentence so he for example ask the user to enter a value

118
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,770
he entered hello world and here he basically the program counts.

119
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,580
Oh there are two upper cases and the rest of lowercase.

120
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:30,820
Right.

121
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,240
So here there's two upper cases and eight lower cases.

122
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,850
Question 13 I'm asking to write a code that takes the range number of number let's say for any number

123
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,850
from one hundred to 900.

124
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,580
So the user will insert the upper lower bound and I'm asking to print numbers would all digits are even

125
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,620
so basic.

126
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,340
You're getting all these two numbers and he were printing when all the additions digits are even so

127
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,660
let's say two hundred two or two two or four to a six all digits not just the numbers and just the numbers

128
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,390
would be pretty easy.

129
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,460
Here we have to kind of you know create a loop that basically goes along for each of these like you

130
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,840
know like digits and check of the R even or odd question number 14 we're asking to write a code that

131
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,410
prints I love you for example followed by your significant other name every three seconds.

132
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,590
Again you need to do kind of accident research and I give you kind of a hint to use time dot sleep.

133
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,480
OK.

134
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,840
That will you know kind of you know you answer the name of significant other it's a mom for example.

135
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,920
I guess if I love your mom and then after three seconds you print I love you mom and then you keep doing

136
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,460
this and you need to make sure that basically this loop will keep going forever.

137
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,360
So you have to go here to colonel and do interrupt so to interrupt the Colonel so question 15.

138
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,870
I'm asking theoretical that asking users to enter a password and ensure that the password satisfy the

139
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,230
following conditions has to have at least 10 characters has to contain at least one uppercase and at

140
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,030
least one number.

141
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,780
OK.

142
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,040
For example if the user enter let's say hello world you're going to say OK.

143
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,550
Password does not satisfy the requirements because there's no number in it overheated when the user

144
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,120
tried to enter.

145
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,420
Hello.

146
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,430
One world.

147
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,690
I say OK you password save successfully.

148
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,830
All right.

149
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,040
Why.

150
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,630
Because that's five all the three requirements and the last question I'm asking you try to code that

151
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,660
continuously gets data from the user and calculate the average and print it out on the screen.

152
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,510
So simply you're going to have a while loop or for loop.

153
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,250
Right.

154
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:35,380
And every time the user can insert a number let's say 10 then the average will be 10 and then let's

155
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,040
say they use an and 20.

156
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,580
So the average going to be 20 plus 10 divided by two which are going to be 15 and then using instead

157
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,580
a new number and they're going to divide again.

158
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,130
I'm going to click the continuous average as the user feeds in the data.

159
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,970
All right.

160
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,850
So best of luck.

161
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,040
And again if you guys get stuck there are tons of challenging questions here.

162
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,180
The objective obviously is not to challenge you at all.

163
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,890
The objective is for us to practice just stretch your limits as much as you can.

164
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,930
And then in the next lecture we're going to walk you through all the examples in great details.

165
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,090
Best of luck and see you guys in the next lecture.
