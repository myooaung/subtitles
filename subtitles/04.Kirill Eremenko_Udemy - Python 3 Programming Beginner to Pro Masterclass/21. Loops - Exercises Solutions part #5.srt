00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,460
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,590
All right I'm super excited because we're actually getting closer to finish the four and why loop and

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,430
you guys can become experts.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:17,510
We have a lot of we've got a lot of questions in here and it has been an exciting journey so far.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,480
So here I'm asking to write a code that prints I love you for example or whatever text you want it followed

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,810
by your significant other name every three seconds.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,360
OK.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,410
So the overall idea is to try to learn how can we use time that sleep.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,960
OK let's see how can we do this.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,930
Okay.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,180
Import that's kind of an external research right.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,900
They need to do import time.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:53,480
And what I want you to do is to say OK let's say enter or input enter the name of your significant other

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,350
significant other.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,630
Right.

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,160
OK and these are going to insert that we want to keep it as string.

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,180
No problem.

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,500
And when I wanted to do here I wanted to keep printing it every three seconds what I could do going

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,340
to say it while true forget guys remember while two means that I'm going to keep printing forever unless

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:26,190
I actually stop it somehow mistake every time going to say OK print and say OK I love you for instance.

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,300
Right.

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,720
And we can you know like print the name that we're going to be fair here.

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,470
If we do this that would keep going forever.

24
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:33,820
Right.

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,920
But what I wanted to do here are going to basically add kind of a delay in here so what I could do in

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,890
this okay time dot sleep and get specify how many seconds in here.

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,960
Three that means you're just going to go and sleep with this three seconds and go up again do it again.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,180
Sleep with this that's kind of you know you're putting the loop on hold for a while.

29
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,550
Please bear in mind that this would get to keep going technically forever.

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:57,800
Okay.

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,240
Yes it going be delayed every few seconds where they keep going forever right.

32
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,440
Right.

33
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,830
Let's run that they'd like you know mom for example and I love your mom.

34
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,630
And then three seconds later I love your mom.

35
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,940
Then she sings later.

36
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,760
I love your mom.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,380
OK.

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,000
It's pretty interesting and can use it you know to show it to your mom for example you know like you

39
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,120
love her or something.

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,100
OK.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,150
And what she could do to exit this who's going to come to colonels do interrupt.

42
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,840
It might not actually like sometimes it might take.

43
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,310
OK.

44
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,970
Now it interrupted looks good and that's pretty much all we have for this question.

45
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,650
Question number 15.

46
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:39,160
So I'm asking you to write a code that asks users to enter a password and ensure that the password satisfies

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,360
the following conditions.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:48,310
It has to be at least 10 characters has to contain at least one uppercase and at least one number.

49
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,300
All right.

50
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,200
How can we do that.

51
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,180
OK.

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,830
So what we could do is say OK I have to ask the user several times right.

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,700
So we can have while two as well.

54
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,280
So I'm going to be stuck in a loop.

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,850
I'm going to say okay every time I can ask the user password let's call it password.

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Music equals to input.

57
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,800
And we're going to ask the user OK.

58
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,740
Let's say it's time to change your password.

59
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,970
OK.

60
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,640
Please select a new password.

61
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,230
You know that.

62
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,740
That's what happened on the act when your password actually expires.

63
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:33,870
And first here you will find that basically there is because we added It's here.

64
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,230
So it saw that this is kind of you know like like we we concluded this jingle.

65
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,590
The string has ended here but that's not the case right.

66
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,550
So what it could do going to say okay that's double quotes here.

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,930
And we can come here and make this double OK.

68
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,910
It's actually going to work the exact same way.

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,170
All right looks good.

70
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,620
And here we have to check simply going to do a quick check on the password.

71
00:03:59,420 --> 00:03:59,870
All right.

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,430
First I want to check if it's has more than 10 more than 10 elements one of the characters right have

73
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,540
to check if it is digits.

74
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,590
It's simply it contains at least one number.

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,100
All right.

76
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,160
And you have to check as well if it is it has at least one uppercase.

77
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,120
Right.

78
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,950
How can we do that.

79
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:26,050
Going gonna say okay if lengths of my password was greater than or equal to 10.

80
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,010
That's my first check and I'm going to check as well.

81
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,840
I have to check if there is any of the characters.

82
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,640
So how can we check.

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,280
How can we check that.

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,490
That's actually pretty interesting.

85
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,060
That's this again kind of new we haven't done that before.

86
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,700
Let's.

87
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,090
Can we do.

88
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,340
They're going to take a four car in password so I can say okay every time going to go ahead.

89
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,640
Again that's my second condition.

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,110
Please don't be confused and say okay.

91
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,130
If you go ahead and do that password take it a character.

92
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,010
Right.

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,810
And whatever is gonna get out of it if you find the car dot is digit

94
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,140
is digit.

95
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,700
If you find that's actually has one digit.

96
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,990
Right.

97
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,680
OK.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,160
So to check if there is what we call it like.

99
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,740
Like only one condition has been happening when you use the any reserved word going say gave any of

100
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,380
this happened so if any of these conditions happened.

101
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:30,300
If you find in just one single digit then you here are going to return true which is good because this

102
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,310
has to be to have to be satisfied.

103
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,660
This has to be satisfied.

104
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,670
And we actually get to do the exact same thing as well but we need to make sure that it's an upper case

105
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,190
right.

106
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,160
So the second end and here we're going to see if again car.

107
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:51,240
But here it must not is digit going to see if it's is upper and that's it.

108
00:05:51,260 --> 00:06:00,820
If that is satisfied if that happened what we could do here is take a print password new password

109
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,670
saved successfully.

110
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,220
And all we could do here are gonna say okay.

111
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,080
And basically here we have to break actually.

112
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,840
So here we have make sure that we actually get a break right.

113
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,700
Because the password sucks.

114
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,700
It looks successful.

115
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,890
I have to bring the why loop I don't need to go ahead and as the users to enter another password I would

116
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,910
be annoyed because you know he answered.

117
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,340
He answered all everything is right.

118
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,510
But again it's still illegal ask him to enter a new password Elsa against UK print media say OK password

119
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,510
does not satisfy satisfy the requirements

120
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:53,780
all right requirements believe that's the way and that's it.

121
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,070
OK let's take a look.

122
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,220
So let's run it and say enter a new password let's say hello.

123
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,170
Well password does not satisfy the requirement and you feel you find that it's you are still stuck in

124
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,110
a loop right.

125
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,760
Okay let's try.

126
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,410
Hello.

127
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,420
All uppercase password does not satisfy the requirement the point is here he obviously can improve on

128
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,900
this and make a little bit more advanced to tell you okay why doesn't satisfy the requirements right.

129
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,100
So simply here you have to check which one have been false.

130
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,180
Going to say Okay Hello.

131
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,650
Let's say 10 let's say world.

132
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,960
So here we satisfy the 10 elements.

133
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,890
And he sets five that there is a digit at least and we're uppercase.

134
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,500
Let's run it.

135
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:34,910
Well.

136
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,180
Password safe successful.

137
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
That's perfect.

138
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,670
That's exactly what we're looking for.

139
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,350
All right.

140
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,630
OK.

141
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,350
The last question here.

142
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:51,830
I'm asking you to write the code that continuously gets a number of data from the user and can keep

143
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,940
the average and printed on industry.

144
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,750
All right.

145
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:09,630
How can we do that when I say a print say for example keep keep entering numbers and they will calculate

146
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,600
the average for you.

147
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,590
Something like that.

148
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,480
Something fun like this.

149
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,230
Then when I say Okay now I need to define simply two parameters right.

150
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,090
I need to define a kind of an accumulator that will get a carry the average.

151
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,160
Right.

152
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,870
And we'll set it to zero.

153
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,350
And I need to set this as well to know how many elements have been input and how many numbers have been

154
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,110
going to sort of set it to zero first here.

155
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,490
Take a while true obviously sorry wild and white.

156
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:48,710
While true and they need to say okay every time I'm going ask the user to input enters a number.

157
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,270
So using an insert the number X..

158
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,130
Right.

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,670
And every time I say Okay let's count one.

160
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,900
So n plus equal one figures remember.

161
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,930
Okay.

162
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,240
All right so I accumulated the number because the user just entered the number eight.

163
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,670
So now I have the total numbers of the user have entered.

164
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,440
Actually 1.

165
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,940
Now Masaki my average

166
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,820
equals 2.

167
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,760
And that's pretty little bit tricky okay.

168
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,950
That's kind of you know the equation that we need to follow.

169
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:28,120
Going to say okay he is gonna say that's my outcome going to Psyche my average right getting multiplied

170
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,830
by when I say okay my N minus one.

171
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,090
All right.

172
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,800
And I'm going to add along and get on top of it.

173
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:43,070
The value of x which is simply the new number or a new value that users have entered.

174
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,800
So that's kind of my accumulators too.

175
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,290
First when I started when I take my average right now is zero right.

176
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,020
So zero.

177
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,370
OK so zero plus X which is my new number.

178
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,920
Okay that's will be my new number and whatever you're gonna be getting here I'm going to say Okay let's

179
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,560
take that and let's divided by the value of n right.

180
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,290
Okay.

181
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,150
That's it.

182
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,990
That's pretty much it.

183
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,000
So every time I'm gonna go ahead take my average multiplied by N minus one.

184
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,440
Add up to it the new number that I've got and divided by the new value n all right okay.

185
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,270
Looks pretty good so far.

186
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:39,760
Okay let's let's print my current average is and what we could do.

187
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:47,930
We could do this and here we're going to say okay let's print out the average.

188
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,470
All right.

189
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,380
Think there is maybe a bracket missing but let's let's see.

190
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,490
Let's see if that works or not.

191
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,100
Let's run that.

192
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,520
So I'm gonna tell you okay into numbers into the average for you.

193
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,210
And it seems that here's and enter a number.

194
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,910
Oh obviously sorry I should have added input.

195
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,060
My apologies.

196
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:16,640
There'll be input into the number Okay let's run it.

197
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:23,060
Did you enter a number and say let's say 10 average just 10 let's say insert for example 10 again averages

198
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:23,630
10.

199
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,200
Then again average just then makes sense.

200
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,830
Let's enter for example 20 average to twelve point five.

201
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,480
Okay.

202
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,580
Obviously because you insert the so many numbers right let's actually go ahead and exit this because

203
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,090
you know like I want to test it on numbers I actually like you know familiar with.

204
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:48,840
Let's let's interrupt and let's try to start and clear outputs let's run it again.

205
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:53,920
Okay.

206
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,010
So and So 10 and 10 you average let's say for example 20.

207
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,590
I know that the average should be 15 right.

208
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,170
If I run it great it looks good.

209
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,230
My count average 15.

210
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,490
Let's add another 15.

211
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:11,180
So there will be again 15 15 at a 20 the average will be 16 at a 20 the average will be sixteen point

212
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,970
six and so on so forth.

213
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,900
All right.

214
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,260
That's pretty much obviously two to exit this maybe you can insert for example like our letter or something

215
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,120
that you OK not that they were going to exit right away OK.

216
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,410
All right.

217
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,920
And that's pretty much it.

218
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,390
That's pretty much all what I have for this lectures.

219
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,100
I hope you guys enjoy the exercise lecture and in the future in the next lecture I'm going to learn

220
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,090
how can we do functions.

221
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,650
I'm going to do lambda expressions it has tons of information tons of learning coming up.

222
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,560
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next lecture.
