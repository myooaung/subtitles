00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,470
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,790
I hope you guys were able to figure out at least maybe the first three questions that we have here.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,890
So let's get started.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,560
So here I am asking you what will this code generate.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,520
OK so here I am asking is Python equals to Python and all of them here please note that all of them

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,780
here uppercase here we have the only the first letters uppercase and all of them here are lowercase.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,870
So simply all letters have to match in order to generate true.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,930
So that means here this is false.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,270
Right OK.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,030
The next question I'm asking is print is Python equals to python.

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,890
Well both of them looks good.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,880
So here we are two you asking is Python not equals to python.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,140
Well python is actually equal to python.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,230
All of them they are exactly matching.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,060
So I'm asking they are not equal.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,590
Well that was false.

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,110
Right here I am saying is 15 not equals to 10.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,330
Well that's true.

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,520
This statement is actually true because 15 is actually not equal to 10.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,320
All right let's run that.

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,330
And that's what we got here.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,030
False to false true.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,030
Looks great.

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,300
All right.

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,250
OK.

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,840
Let's get good.

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,380
Keep going.

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,650
Let's go ahead to the next question that we are asking what will this code generate.

29
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,120
So let's assume that again we don't know what's happening here.

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,500
Let's see how can we analyze this statement.

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,430
It's going to say OK is hello not equal to Hello.

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,250
This is this First we have to analyze them one by one right.

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm saying OK.

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,140
Hello.

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,910
Not equal to Hello.

36
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,190
Well that was true statement.

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:45,480
Right.

38
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,500
OK.

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,710
Because here not all of them are are the same.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,080
Not all of them are uppercase for instance.

41
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,560
Mercifully end is six greater than two.

42
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,030
Well that was true.

43
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,820
It's five equals to five.

44
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,220
Well that was true as well.

45
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,920
So here they have two and true and true then the outcome should be true.

46
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,030
All right.

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,580
The next question I'm asking is print.

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,500
Hello.

49
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,810
Hello.

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,380
Not equals to Hello.

51
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,850
Well is Hello.

52
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,160
This one not equals two.

53
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,730
Hello.

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,830
Well this statement is actually true.

55
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,600
Right and I'm saying or well they actually don't need to continue anymore.

56
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

57
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,340
Why.

58
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,340
Because if one statement of one only is true.

59
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,390
That's it.

60
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,420
You know then the outcome or anything.

61
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,510
So here if I said let's say anything.

62
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,460
Okay.

63
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,020
Wherever Whatever value the output will be true and no matter what.

64
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,390
All right.

65
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,810
So basically both of them are true.

66
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,120
Let's run this through.

67
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,760
Let's run this.

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,210
The outcome is true.

69
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,670
All right.

70
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,540
Looks great.

71
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,560
Let's go ahead and check the third question here.

72
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,280
I'm saying OK what will this code generate.

73
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,930
Here I have X equals 20 y equals to 30.

74
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,640
And I wanted to see two print is X equals Y X not equal Y and so on.

75
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,110
So first is X equals to Y.

76
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,480
Well this statement is false.

77
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,980
Here I am saying is X not equals 2 y.

78
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,150
Well the statement is true right.

79
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,290
Is X which is 20 is 20 greater than 30.

80
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,890
Well that was false.

81
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,750
If is 20 less than 30.

82
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,860
Well this is true.

83
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,830
Is X equals to Y.

84
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,360
That was false right.

85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,200
Please make sure to add the hash tag here.

86
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,920
So yes it is x equals two Y.

87
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:57,320
Well that was false and then or is X not equals 2 I am saying is X not equal to y.

88
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,900
Well that was true.

89
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,790
So if I say 0 or 1 the outcome will be true.

90
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,150
Right.

91
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,820
The outcome will be one.

92
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,310
I am saying is X equals to Y is 20 equals to 30.

93
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,780
Well the answer is false.

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,100
And I'm saying end is X not equals 2 y which is true.

95
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,680
Same the outcome should be 1.

96
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,480
Think of it again as multiplication multiply okay is one multiplied by a zero mystery multiplied by

97
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,050
1.

98
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,830
The outcome should be zero which is to be false.

99
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,810
All right let's double check.

100
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,330
So if we check that we'll see the case.

101
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,610
OK.

102
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,500
That is false.

103
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:42,160
False True True False True and then true and false.

104
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,340
All right.

105
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,800
That's pretty much it.

106
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,110
OK.

107
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,910
So.

108
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,230
So now we're able to.

109
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,190
I hope you guys were able to figure out the these first three questions yourself as well.

110
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,230
I hope you guys enjoyed that lecture and in the next lecture we to keep going with questions for up

111
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,230
till 10.

112
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,920
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next lecture.
