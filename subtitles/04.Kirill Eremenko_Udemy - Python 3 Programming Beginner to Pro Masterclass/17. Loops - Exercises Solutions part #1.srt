00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:04,100
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,090
Let's get started.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,810
And let's keep solving our questions for four and why loop.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,730
OK.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,900
I hope you guys were able to figure out maybe one or two of these questions or hopefully all of them.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,330
I hope.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,800
All right let's get started.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,450
So you know I'm asking you to tell me what do you expect here this code to generate.

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,220
OK.

10
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,410
So here we have a list which is my phone equals to iPhone BlackBerry Samsung and Google.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,380
And I'm setting an integer.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,270
You know what counter to zero.

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,560
And I'm asking would kill while as long as the counter I which is zero less than lengths of my phone's

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,710
OK which is simply going to before.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,530
Right.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,760
And say OK every time I get my phone.

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,420
Of index.

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,010
So we're going to be phone of zero.

19
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,280
We're going to be basically iPhone.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,810
Right.

21
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,760
And that will be in the phone and basically increment the counter.

22
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,390
Which is fine.

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,800
That's not a problem.

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,070
Thinking I'm asking if phone which is you know might be iPhone might be BlackBerry might be Samsung

25
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,290
as we go through the wire loop every time right.

26
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,070
I'm okay if iPhone was equal to Samsung I'm getting what I'm going to do here.

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,210
Yes.

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,390
OK.

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,950
Continue.

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,510
Which means when I say continue that means I'm basically going to I'm going to keep going as long as

31
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,350
I haven't met the Samsung or the not all the Samsung value here.

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,640
OK.

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,100
So simply put what I'm going to do here.

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,330
Let's say if I run it's going to say OK so here I've got the iPhone and then I've got the BlackBerry.

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,620
OK.

36
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,050
Because every time I'm gonna go hear music if the phone equals Samsung.

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,750
No.

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,620
So if it's not equal Samsung beats are going to skip this and they're going to print.

39
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:40,860
Right.

40
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,530
So that's why I print iPhone and then go ahead for the for why loop.

41
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,650
Take BlackBerry.

42
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,620
Right.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,140
Go ahead.

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,580
Here check is BlackBerry equal to Samsung.

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,430
No.

46
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,060
So basically in a skip the continue.

47
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,490
Right.

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,220
And then that's why I printed BlackBerry.

49
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,720
Go up again to Samsung.

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,860
I mean I say okay is Samsung equal to Samsung.

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,490
Yes.

52
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,720
So here I'm going to execute basically my command here continue.

53
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,480
And that would simply going to ask me to continue.

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:14,010
So again to skip basically the the the Samsung portion and that's why I didn't pin the Samsung here.

55
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,590
So we skipped basically the print and then we'll go up again.

56
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,370
Right.

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,390
We took the Google and then we check is Google equal to Samsung.

58
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:21,990
No.

59
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,200
So we skip the continue and we print the Google in here.

60
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,490
All right.

61
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,350
So basically I just wanted to hear to check if the were the Samsung or just gonna skip it.

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,650
That's pretty much it.

63
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,140
All right.

64
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,050
OK.

65
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:41,430
For question 2 I'm asking you to write a code that display all numbers from 1 to 20 using while and

66
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,710
for loops.

67
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,080
All right.

68
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,240
OK.

69
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,660
So can we do that let's first start with the full four.

70
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,280
Let's start with the flu first.

71
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,970
Let's say OK for I am going to say range because remember the range from 1 till 20.

72
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,610
Right.

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,220
Because here if you guys remember I just wanted to print one too.

74
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,170
Let's say 19 that I want to print kind of you know like I like excluding number 20.

75
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,730
Obviously you guys can increase that and make it 21 so you can actually print the value of 20.

76
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,450
Right.

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,690
And then you're gonna say Okay print get a print I okay.

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,800
That's it.

79
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,100
So let's run it.

80
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,570
And that's what we've got here.

81
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,300
If you don't actually print from one till 20 just make that 21.

82
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,090
Let's run it.

83
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,390
And then here you get the numbers from 1 to 20.

84
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,040
All right.

85
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,960
OK.

86
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,640
Next question is using why loop.

87
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,560
So I'm asking you to using while.

88
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,340
So I'm gonna say OK I'm gonna ask you OK.

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,430
While as long as it's just an index whatever index that is so.

90
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,290
Which means I have to initialize the index here to zero first.

91
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,810
Right.

92
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,880
I say okay as long as my index eye is less than twenty first.

93
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,690
Okay let's see what's going to happen.

94
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,750
Let's go ahead and print i.

95
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:02,620
Let's run that and actually it has been printing zeros all the time right.

96
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,130
Because why.

97
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,690
Because within it accumulate the counters.

98
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,340
Right.

99
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,160
So obviously here I need to activate the counter basically here it's stuck in a loop right.

100
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,040
So going to say OK Colonel interrupt that would enter the kernel and please make sure to actually include

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,640
the counter.

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:15,880
Right.

103
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,110
So going to say okay I equals to I plus 1.

104
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,410
That's a way of doing it.

105
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,570
Another way of saying what could I plus equal one which is the exact same way of actually incrementing

106
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:32,470
the counter when I say Okay while I will I less than 20 PRINT I equals two I plus one.

107
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,030
All right.

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,860
Okay.

109
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,720
Actually let's hear.

110
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,580
Let's set that to 1 because we don't we actually want to go ahead and print from 1 starting from 1.

111
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,100
You know we don't want to print to be on number from 1 to 20 not from 0 to 20.

112
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,280
Right.

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
Let's run that.

114
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,430
If we run it yet and come up with 1 to 19 if you wanted to make it 1 2 20 just make this.

115
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,760
Sorry.

116
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,110
Making this twenty one.

117
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,930
Let's run it and you'll come up with numbers from 1 to 20.

118
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,430
All right.

119
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,110
Question number three here I'm asking you to write a code that basically

120
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,460
generate the following table.

121
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,890
I wanted to generate numbers 1 1 1 2 4 8 3 9 27 and so on so forth.

122
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,490
Let's see how can we do this.

123
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:25,540
So what we could do we going to say okay for x in range and I wanted to print apparently numbers here

124
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,560
from 1 till 10 first right.

125
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,010
Ignore what I'm gonna do for the next column and the third column.

126
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,080
It seems like here I need a for loop right.

127
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,730
Change from one till 10.

128
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,950
That's what I know.

129
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,110
Okay I need from one to 11.

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,200
If you guys remember range I don't exclude the last Elementary.

131
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,800
That's why I included two print.

132
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,770
Actually Number 10 I need to put here eleven right.

133
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,640
OK.

134
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,520
We're going to say print and I can simply print.

135
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,330
Here again we can use the format method.

136
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,330
So here I need one here.

137
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,100
Right.

138
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,820
And then again another curly bracket.

139
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,770
Again another curly bracket just to print the number.

140
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,010
It's square and it's cube as well right.

141
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,440
So keep dot format because remember.

142
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
And then it can pass along the value of x.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,790
I can pass along X times X right.

144
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,060
I can pass along X times X times X right.

145
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,430
Which is basically the person on the number Square and it's cube looks good.

146
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,990
Obviously we have just one little modification going to do Let's print it out first.

147
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,910
Let's see what's going to happen.

148
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,260
Let's run it.

149
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,000
And that's what we have got here.

150
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,210
We have got you know all the numbers 1 1 1 2 4 8 3 9 27.

151
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,740
Looks great right.

152
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,980
All right.

153
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,080
What we could do as well is maybe we can organize it a little bit.

154
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,700
Let's go ahead and maybe copy this.

155
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,750
And that's actually part of the solution lecture.

156
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,170
You guys we know the notebook.

157
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,040
What are the other solutions are here I added you know like kind of

158
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,850
elements here just to indicate how many decimal points I wanted to print.

159
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:08,080
So here I want to say Okay I need to print let's say 0 OK 2 D.

160
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,550
So I'm saying okay I need to print zero decimals okay.

161
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,270
And I'm printing.

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,790
I wanted to print right here.

163
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,670
I wanted to print two decimal points.

164
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,820
Okay let's go ahead and make it okay.

165
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,040
I need to print.

166
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,520
He had three decimal points.

167
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,800
And here I wanted to print let's say four decimal points 2 and 4.

168
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,170
Let's see what's going to happen here.

169
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,120
Let's run it.

170
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,800
And that's what I've got here.

171
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,340
It's way more organized way more you know kind of like don't like much much prettier.

172
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:40,960
All right.

173
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,840
That's all we have for this lecture.

174
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,110
Again we in this actually we went through the solution for the first three questions and in the next

175
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,910
lecture we're gonna keep going and continue solving all the questions.

176
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,550
I hope you guys enjoy the lecture and see you in the next lecture.
