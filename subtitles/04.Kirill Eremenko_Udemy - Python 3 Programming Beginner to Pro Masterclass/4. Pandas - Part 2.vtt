1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.660
Read the next step that we're going to be talking about here is how can we use penders the inner freedom

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.390
place specific functions.

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.240
So let's assume they find a function again.

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.140
We we we covered functions before.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.910
So you as I'm assuming those are experts now by now when it comes to function let's assume they have

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.660
a function that let's say perform kind of a cellular raise you Centre with a certain salary or hourly

7
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.030
rate and then it as let's say raise of two dollars for those.

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.400
So again the function is called Def sellery Raise it send it send it the argument why what it does is

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.000
just return y plus two which is simply put just adds whatever argument to the function you can add to

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.450
to it if you under this.

11
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.060
That's my function.

12
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.610
What you could do instead of actually going there and accessing different elements within the penders

13
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.100
been offline you can actually just apply a certain function right away and that's the power of penders.

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.400
You can just load huge amount of data okay which is huge Excel data within Python and what we could

15
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.760
do.

16
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.520
We can define whatever function call a specific column and apply function to it which is very very extremely

17
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.790
powerful.

18
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.130
So I could do.

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.960
You'd want to look.

20
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.820
When I look at the sanity column what I'm going to do here going funky d.f. I'm looking for the Salida

21
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.140
column.

22
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.340
That's how you access that sanity column and then you can use the dot apply to apply a specific function

23
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.650
which essentially you can possibly move the function here.

24
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.180
If you run that then you would see you came up with a salary which is 35 became 37 29 became thirty

25
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.720
one.

26
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.810
You simply added to each of these columns.

27
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.600
What if I wanted for example to go here with the employee.

28
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.740
Let's see a name and again the length of the number of kempton's each kind.

29
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.690
So again in a month that they'll tell you okay.

30
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.060
Now I have six characters.

31
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.620
Now I have five characters.

32
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.960
Now I have four and I have four or five of his and so on so forth.

33
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.750
OK.

34
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.030
Or.

35
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.460
What if I wanted to let's say some or the number of use of experience within a column you get again.

36
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.230
It's like it's like excel when you write.

37
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.240
For example some men who specify the column what columns you want out of some major sum that you can

38
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.630
do in here and post are using penders that offering you get quality a D F square bracket years of experience

39
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.330
got a dart some that will simply sum up of the number of years of experience.

40
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.580
If you go back you sum up the platform at 7 7 and 10 that's 17 and that's how he come up with a number

41
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.440
of different teams thought a number of viewers.

42
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.150
OK.

43
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.260
What if he wanted to let's see perform some sorting and ordering.

44
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.560
So here let's assume I find the airframe PD the data frame.

45
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.970
That's again my exect and then from that the find before we know that we're very familiar with it and

46
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.140
what it could do here.

47
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.680
Ken let's see sort where the number of years of experience.

48
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.900
OK so let's assume they're going to be more this line first so I'm going to go now.

49
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.410
Just copy this.

50
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.160
Actually just let's copy it's going to create a cabinet and then get anymore.

51
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.480
This line at first in place two I'm going to show you what you mean by this.

52
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.100
Let's assume they're going to sort the array.

53
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.370
OK.

54
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.460
Sorry saw the pen did a frame by so called sort underscore values and by equal in this piece a five

55
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.720
give which column you're looking for to actually sort your pain there's the traffic.

56
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.870
If you run this then you will see the action sorted it.

57
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.030
So now you sort of the pen did a frame.

58
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.000
These a number of years of expediency you took.

59
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.870
Actually he had the bird put in number one and then he got this good three and then four and then nine.

60
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.710
That's how you do sorting it.

61
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.370
The key element here is that if I go up here and they find the f again and run it you will be surprised.

62
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.530
You'd be like okay what happened if you run d.f. again you will see that you actually did enchained

63
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.110
the order that'll be a repeat of the pair of the dataflow him anymore.

64
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.440
You actually went back to the original one.

65
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.940
Why.

66
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.790
Why event.

67
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.020
That's because you didn't put what we call in place equal to what happened here.

68
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200
Event you simply.

69
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.040
Okay you perform that sort of thing.

70
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.060
But he actually didn't override the auditioner origin of the order to do that.

71
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.340
You have to specify in place equal to when you do this.

72
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.780
That means okay I am going to do the sorting by going to actually do that effectively on the actual

73
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.710
beta from the F.

74
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.050
So if you should run this d.f. AGAIN sort it underscores the values again by equals the user experience

75
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.120
the exact theme of this where instead you specify in place equates to true.

76
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.500
If you done this and if you run d.f. then you're going to come up with with the source of the error

77
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.450
they are going to be in.

78
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.720
Override the origin of the offering that you had before.

79
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.640
All right.

80
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.080
So now we know how can we perform sorting end or doing how can we do all our lies specific functions

81
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.770
to it.

82
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.660
And how can we apply logic loss of operations on penders the free or a.

83
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.930
Okay.

84
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.050
So how can we do concatenation and merging.

85
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.920
OK so let's assume that we have ceded freedoms the ef1 which is a fine he d.f. to and D3 and I wanted

86
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.340
to see concatenate them on to put them in one big data.

87
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.120
How can we do that.

88
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.340
Let's define them first.

89
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.260
So going to find them first as a dictionary you know using addition to the funky PD that they refrain

90
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.490
from gillispie swag in open brackets are going to have a which is a one a one in old in one with three

91
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.160
B again.

92
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.850
C indeed.

93
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.030
And here I'm going to specify my index we're going to be zidan want to see mr. on that.

94
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.380
And let's look at the d.f..

95
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.870
And that's kind of you know Minimed to sell your team.

96
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.600
We're going to find again another Matrix.

97
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.170
And I did a free but instead of having a naughty E3 we're going to have 47.

98
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.470
Great.

99
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.950
Let's run that.

100
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.570
Let's plug the d.f. too.

101
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.200
And that's the EF 2 again.

102
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.130
All right.

103
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.100
And he does specify the index they're going to be four five six and seven and that's why we're going

104
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.750
to come up with these indices here.

105
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.370
Here's the index was it 0 1 2 3.

106
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.900
Okay.

107
00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.550
Hear that and this will d.f. to.

108
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.940
It's actually four five six seven or eight.

109
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.220
What if I wanted to let's say create them in a third date a frame.

110
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.310
That's how we define it and you plot it.

111
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.440
That will be my third offering if I wanted to simply concatenate.

112
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.430
When I see concatenate.

113
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.230
That means I'm going to put them all together.

114
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.680
I'm going to just like put them on top of each other.

115
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.610
You can specify that if I get PDA sense for a pen did a green dot cat concatenate open brackets and

116
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.860
then specify the agway and edf ONE first gift to an industry.

117
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.560
If you round that then you would come up with this big bedframe that has all these small offerings in

118
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.970
it altogether and that's simply what we have.

119
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.380
You have the one gift to give three.

120
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.860
You put them together you come up with the result here.

121
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.830
So let's take a look at another example.

122
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:56.610
So here if we let's say the time again another did a frame as a data okay with it contains again employee

123
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.660
I.D. which is want to see 45.

124
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.780
These are the first names of all the employees they have.

125
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.720
And these are the last names of other employees they have.

126
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.160
And let's assume that that's for example our engineering department.

127
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.240
So he could do that you can create PD.

128
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.580
They're free.

129
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.910
You define the raw data.

130
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.560
You can simply instead of actually find them separately.

131
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.860
You can buy them here again as kind of you know you do a dictionary and then he you specify OK.

132
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.700
That's my column and I'm looking for I'm looking for column employee I.D. I'm looking for a first name.

133
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.230
I'm looking for last name that would get to create your data.

134
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.460
If you run this this simply we're going to create a field that has employee I.D. for column QAs years

135
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.810
postponed.

136
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.450
Here have my first name here and last name here.

137
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.080
All right.

138
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.950
Let's assume may have for example another let's say five employees but they were clits in the finance

139
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.890
department.

140
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:53.340
So you know they find a complete ideas different obviously have six seven eight nine and 10 first name

141
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.950
bets and these are the first names.

142
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.660
And these are all the last names.

143
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.790
And he can define again PD that they add a frame create a frame out of the dictionary by specifying

144
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.710
the raw data that we have here and then specify what columns I'm looking for.

145
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.130
Right.

146
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.300
And they'll get going to be my finance department.

147
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.540
So these are the employee the part me that's my finance that's my finance department.

148
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.970
So what I could do here.

149
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:23.040
They can find again and other data field with has employee I.D. and have the standards simply put a

150
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.150
have a date a frame that has all the indices of employees and you had first name last name.

151
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:34.410
I'm going to find another in a frame that has again the seemingly I.D. but we have celebes only celeries

152
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:35.350
column only.

153
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.930
And then I wanted to see how can we merge them together.

154
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.580
Okay.

155
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.700
That's how can you do merging and joining within with impaired is the different.

156
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:48.630
All right so let's run this that want to create simply my employee I.D. here one two three four and

157
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.390
up until 10 with all the hourly salary.

158
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.170
So what I could do.

159
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:58.140
First they can actually concatenate which is just put them together the finest Department the imaging

160
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.910
department on top of each other.

161
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.740
Again I've done that before.

162
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:07.440
PD The DOD concat then you open up you specify this is going to be first the engineering department

163
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.110
and then the Pioneer's department.

164
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:18.960
If you've done that then you come up with simply put our our dinner frame here that has simply our engineering

165
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.460
first followed by the finance after what I could do.

166
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:30.680
After that I can again concatenate the finance department in the engineering department and can create

167
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.280
other deeded offerings here.

168
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.970
As you can see here instead of of running them by default penders we're just going to put them kind

169
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.400
of you know on top of each others what it could do.

170
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:48.540
We wanted to put them next to each other which is by the Collen can specify the axis if specify X equals

171
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.280
one.

172
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.900
That means we need to put this the first in a frame first followed by the one delivery.

173
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.860
Next which is by the column.

174
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.590
In general by default if you don't specify access or he specify exits will 0 they're going to put them

175
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.130
on top of each other.

176
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:09.870
Or it obviously I'm not going to use this because I need to match will join this basically with my salary

177
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.030
I need to join these two together.

178
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.610
So to do there then I can use Pedia that medrash and they can specify which column that it wanted to

179
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.360
merge together.

180
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.270
I don't want to repeat that idea because it's repeated in two separate data frames.

181
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:31.500
So we're going to say OK we need to demerge d.f. along with the d.f. sellery on and I specify my column

182
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.210
which column that it wanted to merge them together.

183
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.310
If I own this then you will see that's bewley's who is he that umpire.

184
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:44.740
You only have one employee I.D. I have or my first name last name and arming send and that's it.

185
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.020
That's pretty much all I have for penders Need a fee.

186
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.290
I hope you guys enjoy their section and see you in the next section.
