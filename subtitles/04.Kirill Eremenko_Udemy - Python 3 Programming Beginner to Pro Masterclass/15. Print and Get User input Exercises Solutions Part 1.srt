00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,000
I hope you guys were able to figure it out.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,830
You know at least a couple of the questions that you guys had before if not that's fine that's built

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,120
you know like all the solutions together.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,680
OK.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,380
So I'm asking you to do for the first question is to write a code that takes a speed inputs from a user

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,320
in kilometres per hour converts it into miles per hour and then print both speeds on the screen something

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,630
like.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,650
That's what I'm expecting to see basically.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,430
Right.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,600
So let's take a look.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,710
It's going to do here.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,750
Don't find a variable in a kilometre column but to put our whole key in MH You can call it whatever

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,970
they're going to say OK it equals two.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,840
And then as the user to input data is going to say input.

16
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,660
OK.

17
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,460
And I'm going to as the user to enter speed.

18
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:46,530
Right.

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,090
In kilometres per hour.

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,250
All right.

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,990
And because Hilo have kind of column that I'm asking to do list at column as well.

22
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,240
Right.

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,980
Looks great.

24
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:03,890
One important element here if you as a member of that user input whatever value this number will be

25
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,660
is changing.

26
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,660
Correct.

27
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,660
In order to do the conversion if you guys remember from the string to Integer I have two cast basically

28
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,600
whatever the data that I'm getting here.

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,090
Okay.

30
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,100
And convert it to integer.

31
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,150
You can as well you can obviously take the colombus butt out and convert it as well afterwards but you

32
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,880
can do it in one shot to see.

33
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:27,700
It's open parentheses and come here and close the parentheses.

34
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,820
That's it.

35
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,490
So whatever string value that we're going to be fed here we're going to be converted into integer afterwards

36
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,920
and be put into colombus put out which is great.

37
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,170
Next step is to say okay I need mph would be equal to basically the equation that we have done before.

38
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,370
Point 6 to 1 4 right.

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,510
Multiply that by the K H which is the value that will take before.

40
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,480
Please make sure that all the letters are in lower case so you won't have any issues afterwards.

41
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,740
OK.

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,940
Now you have done the quad version.

43
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,950
That's great.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,450
Well you could do it afterwards if you want just to print the data on the screen.

45
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,650
I need to print Speen in Columbus but our equals to whatever you can do that.

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,780
OK let's take a look.

47
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,060
So going to say cannot say okay print open parentheses OK.

48
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,400
Open again.

49
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,200
Quality of scale speed in kilometres per hour right.

50
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,620
Are those good and a C equals two.

51
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,460
Because there is an equal right.

52
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,970
And what I could do here.

53
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,890
I'm going to say okay comma.

54
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,740
I'm going to print kilometres per hour which is my value here that I have you but I need to pin the

55
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,950
units so basically this what I'm going to be expecting to see here.

56
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,170
What I need to do they need to see a case space as well.

57
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,330
I'm going to put here kilometres per hour.

58
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,360
Upper case which is not going to be printed afterwards after the number.

59
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,150
Okay.

60
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,040
Looks great.

61
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,900
When to do we are going to copy this.

62
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,620
I'm going to make it again here.

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:03,300
Print speed in miles per hour and miles per hour equals 2 again mph which is the very we have before.

64
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,400
M p h right.

65
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm going to specify mph mph.

66
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,950
Right okay it looks good to me.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,090
Let's run it let's test it with a different number.

68
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,950
Let's run that's a.p. the economics but our.

69
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,150
Let's say it's 50 for example this time.

70
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,170
Run it.

71
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,390
Okay so speed in kilometres per hour equals to 50 kilometres but our richest input data looks great

72
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,750
to me.

73
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,350
This is a free show right here speedin miles per hour is around 31 miles per hour.

74
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,720
Which is again pretty.

75
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,070
Looks good to me as well.

76
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,700
OK.

77
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,990
That's pretty much all what I wanted to do.

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,660
I hope you guys were able to figure that out.

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,210
OK.

80
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,180
Perfect.

81
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,100
The next question that we have is that I ask you to print the calendar for this month.

82
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,630
Just because whatever money you have.

83
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,290
OK.

84
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:58,110
And I wanted to print the calendar using simply this okay to import the module calendar and then here's

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,340
how you're gonna use calendar month.

86
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,800
Pass along whatever number of the year.

87
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,500
Okay.

88
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,770
And pass along the month here OK.

89
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,860
Again this kind of an extended research I haven't covered before but again you know.

90
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,600
Please be prepared to go ahead read the documentation and make sure you're actually familiar with whatever

91
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,790
comment because you.

92
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,970
Be flexible moving forward to do whatever is called on your own.

93
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,430
Now just stick to the Course.

94
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,830
Ok this article looks frivolous imports calendar.

95
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,110
Its first step.

96
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,000
Second step.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,620
Going to say okay you're equal to let's say 20 16 for example.

98
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,680
I'm going to go on.

99
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,600
And let's say for example last month's going to say for example March or thirty or whatever.

100
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,080
Three here.

101
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,780
Well I would do afterwards.

102
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm going to say okay I want it to print.

103
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,760
That's what I wanted to do and I want it to print.

104
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,620
Here's what a listed here bouquet is a faded calendar.

105
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:04,890
But months and they open prentice's if they pass along they hear and again pass along the months then

106
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:10,840
that will helping to simply print whatever you and whatever you think using the calendar.

107
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,030
Basically modu that we imported here.

108
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,420
OK.

109
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,380
Let's give it a shot.

110
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,110
If we're on it that's all we actually get.

111
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,090
It's actually in March 2014 and that's basically the calendar for March 2013.

112
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,870
Just perfect.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,280
OK.

114
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,190
That's pretty much again very easy.

115
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,160
We have a couple of the before.

116
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,830
But again I want you to practice searching like module's on your own.

117
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,630
OK.

118
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,730
All right the next example is I'm asking you to instead of actually feeling this.

119
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,040
OK.

120
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,250
OK.

121
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,980
Actually the months of assembly use to improve the year end the month.

122
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,580
Okay.

123
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,260
Again it should be very straightforward.

124
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,880
Just got a copy.

125
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,510
Basically what we have here.

126
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,460
I'm going to copy the exact same here.

127
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,740
And just a couple of changes.

128
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,590
Here's what I want to do instead of four years to in 2016 and months equals thirty three.

129
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,690
What I wanted to do with I actually ask the users to input the data for me when I say OK and then I

130
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,710
say OK we're going to see more of this are going to use input.

131
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,700
I think as a member input or in parentheses open double quotes and they say OK enter right here and

132
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,050
here.

133
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,350
And actually giving kind of an example as well to the user and say okay for example you entered the

134
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,230
year I'm going to tell you Okay I for example E for example you know double.

135
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,860
Colin I'm going to say 2019 For instance I'm going to do Colin here.

136
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,540
And it's a for example create space.

137
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,960
Looks good to me.

138
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,280
Please don't forget that whatever going to be fed he'll going to come as a string.

139
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,720
You need to do the conversion into an integer.

140
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,640
Again do not cast it as an opening in parentheses and close the parentheses here.

141
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,610
Cake looks good to me.

142
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,330
I'M GOING TO THE EXACT SAME THING.

143
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,350
SAME THING.

144
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,540
Integer open and then input.

145
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,820
Or print.

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,390
Right.

147
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,250
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,900
Input.

149
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,880
Open.

150
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,710
I'm going to say again here.

151
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,570
Right and when asking.

152
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,930
Enter months and then will give them an example of how to in a month.

153
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,840
E n and tell him K for example.

154
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,050
It would be 0 3.

155
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,860
Colin and that's it.

156
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,870
All right so once he was into the year of the month all these variables were going to be fed here and

157
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,420
there are going to be printed on the street.

158
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,500
Alright that's they can look around it.

159
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,290
They took it into a year in the middle of say 2015.

160
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:27,800
Anthea let's say less like a month or eight run it and then actually it's August of 2015.

161
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,650
And that's actually my calendar as well.

162
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,220
Huge.

163
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,730
Very interesting.

164
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,500
All right.

165
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,740
Sounds great.

166
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,270
All right.

167
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,480
And that's we're going to conclude the lecture here and then the next lecture going to continue along

168
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,080
and finish of the coding exercise.

169
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,480
I hope you have enjoyed it and see you in the next election.
