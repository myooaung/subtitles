00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,950
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the biggest lecture we're able to get an overview of how

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:13,130
to write them for a loop and we're able as well to kind of see a little bit of keywords just enumerate

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,160
and some other keywords as well.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,110
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,550
Such as range for instance.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,780
Let's take a look here and see how can we use the word break and continue with it within a for loop

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,680
or a while loop.

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,210
All right.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,550
So let's take a look at what you mean by break and continue this cycle.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,780
Good example.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,680
So assume that I have.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,210
Again my list which is what we have defined before which is let's say list of fruits.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,670
That's actually copy it of writing it again.

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,640
So here we go have Apple blueberries mangoes and so on.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,020
All right.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,800
Press enter it.

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,560
We go if with a view if we'd like to visualize our list.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,730
Here we go this our list.

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,540
Right.

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,560
So what we could do.

21
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,950
I'm going to say OK I wanted to print all the elements within my list.

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,680
We have done that before we have done in the past.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,150
Say before I in my list colon and then say Okay let's go ahead and print my I entered.

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,980
I'll be able to print apples blueberries and so on.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:14,780
Let's assume that I wanted to for example print let's say Apple blueberries mangoes and that's it.

26
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,790
So I wanted to print let's say the first three elements only.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,130
All right.

28
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,720
So how can we do that.

29
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,860
What we could do here.

30
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,910
We're gonna say okay.

31
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,420
For i in my underscore list.

32
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,440
What I could do.

33
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,820
I'm going to say okay let's go ahead and print the value of i.

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,260
Which is exactly the same as before.

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,070
So if I leave it like this then I will go ahead and actually print all of them.

36
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,810
All right.

37
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,080
What I could do instead.

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,780
I can add kind of a little bit of an if condition in here.

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,050
Okay.

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,640
If you guys recall call from previously I can say for example if you find for instance if you find I

41
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:57,050
equals to let's say here identified as mango mango.

42
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,640
If you find that if you find I equals to mango.

43
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,530
So if each of the elements here within my list if you go here and you obtain let's say the first element

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,720
second element third element if any of the elements you are obtaining here you found that that was equal

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,200
to mango.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,340
What are you going to do.

47
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,430
And that's the power that's the new element that I wanted to.

48
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,570
A new concept that I wanted to introduce in this lecture is we can actually use the key words we call

49
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,840
a break to actually kind of break our love for us.

50
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,080
Right.

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,480
Which is kind of very very powerful.

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,570
So what I could do here are going to say if you find R equals to mango.

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,120
Break the loop which means just don't continue.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,320
Just skip it.

55
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,840
Break the full loop and keep going.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,740
All right shift enter.

57
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,670
Here we go.

58
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,520
So now basically we went in there.

59
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,870
We're able to print the apple blueberries mangoes and that's it.

60
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,280
And once we reach the word mango We actually print it out.

61
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:46,610
Right.

62
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,470
Because I do the print beforehand.

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:48,720
Right.

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,970
So I printed the word mango.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,610
Then I came here checked it's i equals to mango.

66
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,360
Yes.

67
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,730
Then I performed this.

68
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,070
So I was able to actually break my loop.

69
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,780
All right.

70
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,070
OK.

71
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,320
Sounds great.

72
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,560
All right.

73
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,200
So now it's time for a quick challenge.

74
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:10,140
What I want you guys to do is to go ahead and print Apple blueberries mangoes and watermelon.

75
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,490
All right.

76
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,320
And stop here.

77
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,540
OK.

78
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,750
So please go ahead pause the video and you'll see guys after the challenge.

79
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,620
All right.

80
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,250
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

81
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,300
What I got what I ask you has to do is to simply print all these elements Apple blueberries mangoes

82
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,840
and watermelon and stop here right.

83
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,060
So let's go ahead and do that.

84
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,880
And I say for I in my list print.

85
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,810
I can print all the elements.

86
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,270
However if you find I equals to my watermelon

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,560
OK.

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,350
Please break.

89
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,300
Just break the loop.

90
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:48,740
Enter.

91
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,650
Here we go.

92
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,200
And here we are able to print Apple blueberries mangoes and watermelon and we'll actually skipped the

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,230
apricots skipped the last element in there.

94
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,620
All right.

95
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,880
OK let's take a look at another example or another keyword that I wanted us to learn.

96
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,610
So now we're able to know what they mean by break.

97
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,330
So break simply just breaks the loop just exit the loop another way.

98
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,640
In other words that we're gonna be using extensively as well throughout the course is the word call

99
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,860
continue.

100
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,170
All right.

101
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,420
So what do you mean by this.

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
I actually have kind of a quick summary for you as here.

103
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,260
So again the windbreak is used to exit the loop.

104
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,880
All right.

105
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,910
The words continue is used to skip the current block and return to the for a while loop.

106
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,350
So simply put I wanted to skip what's happening there and just keep going and just continue to loop

107
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,000
without doing anything.

108
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,680
All right.

109
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,220
So let's see how can we do that.

110
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,030
Let's assume that we have let's say a list of numbers I'm going to call my list equals to just bunch

111
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,310
of numbers in there.

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,330
So we can define it as one two three four five six seven eight nine and let's say 10.

113
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,480
All right.

114
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:58,280
And what I wanted to do you're gonna take a for I in my list I'm going to loop on each element within

115
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,990
my list.

116
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,790
And I wanted to only print the odd numbers only.

117
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,410
So the objective here is to print the odd numbers only.

118
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,690
All right.

119
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,880
So what I could do going to say okay go ahead to each of these elements which is what I said here.

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,370
And if you find in any of these numbers.

121
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,930
All right.

122
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:22,020
Was if you divided it by two and was equals equals to zero if you guys remember.

123
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,330
Right.

124
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,520
So if you find any of these element that was even number.

125
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:25,840
All right.

126
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,630
What I want what I'm asking us to do simply is to continue

127
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,880
else other than that just go ahead and print I.

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,230
OK.

129
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,940
So what the hell happened here.

130
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,030
OK let's ahead I actually go ahead and run it for us to shift enter.

131
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,880
Here we go.

132
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,890
So I was able to simply print all the odd numbers in there so I clicked 1 3 5 7.

133
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,190
So what happened here.

134
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,990
So I can say OK for I in my list.

135
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,870
So please go ahead grab each of the elements within my list.

136
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,090
All right let's actually zoom in a little bit and every time I'm gonna go take that number divide by

137
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,730
two and get the remainder.

138
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:02,990
All right.

139
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,220
If the remainder was equal to zero.

140
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,840
That means it's an even number.

141
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,740
All right.

142
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,910
Please don't do anything.

143
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,520
Continue and it's a continue.

144
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,970
I was just gonna skip that block.

145
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,160
I'm gonna skip all the things that go up again go to the full loop again which means I'm not going to

146
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,270
be executing this command whenever there's an even number.

147
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:28,770
However if it's an odd number if I said OK if I divided by two as equals equals zero failed that means

148
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,780
I'm not going to execute this or going to not going to do the continue I'm actually going to go here

149
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,210
and print that number.

150
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,130
All right.

151
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,350
And that's why I was able to print numbers 1 3 5 7 and 9.

152
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,060
All right.

153
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,610
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

154
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,910
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

155
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,500
Let's recap what we have done so far.

156
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,070
So in this lecture we're able to study just kind of two key words that are very important which is mainly

157
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,710
break and continue.

158
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,970
Break is mainly used to actually break a loop continues mainly used to actually skip that specific block

159
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,820
and go back again and perform the loop again.

160
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,300
All right.

161
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,390
