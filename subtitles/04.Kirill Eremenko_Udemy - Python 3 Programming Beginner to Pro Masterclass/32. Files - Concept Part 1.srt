00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello everyone and welcome to this new section.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:11,520
This section we're going to learn how can we deal with files in general how can we open text files.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:19,860
How to how do we read text files how to write text files and we'll learn as well how can we read them

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,000
right into what we call it C as we file or comments separated files as well.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:24,710
OK.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,700
So let's get started.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,320
So first we in order to deal with files.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,820
First of all the files have to be contained within our current folder.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,380
Ok.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,440
In this exercise we're going to be doing assume OK.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,740
Our Father contained within our folder within the exact same folder that that Jupiter notebook is contained

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,610
in.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:44,850
All right.

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,840
So let's take a look at that.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,490
All right.

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,760
So if you guys take a look at it here you will find that here we have these our CSB.

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,120
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,350
I was shift the notebooks.

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:56,780
OK.

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,020
So here's our old all I was used to notebooks and including all the exercises too.

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,690
And he would find tons of files that is fruits input foods output that is you know like new file.

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,630
There's my file like Long story short all the files that we're dealing with are contained within our

23
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,470
course package.

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:11,890
All right.

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,120
OK.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,730
Let's go here and let's go ahead and see how can we cheat files in general.

27
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,000
OK.

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,100
So let's assume that I wanted to open my file dot text.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,570
OK.

30
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,550
So I'm gonna say F equals to open.

31
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,630
And here I open parentheses and then I have to list what's the name of the file they wanted to open.

32
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:36,310
See they're going gonna call it my file the TSC and I have to specify the reason of opening it.

33
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,510
Why are you opening it open for reading purposes are hoping for writing purposes why are you opening

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,230
scene me I'm opening it for reading purposes.

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,790
OK afterwards are going to say Okay print

36
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,840
and afterwards you're going to say Okay take my so simply put what we do what we did here is that we

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,630
open the text file for reading purposes and pretty much kind of think of F. as kind of the handler.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,660
That's kind of you know the file is became f simply okay.

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,710
So I'm gonna say Okay I need to F and I need to do dot read okay.

40
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,540
And that's it.

41
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,520
And to print it when you press ship enter.

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,300
Here we go.

43
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,210
So now I've been able to actually read all the content within our within our text file.

44
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:22,100
So if you open actually my text files if you will here if you open my files which is this one if you

45
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,130
open it you will find this is the information that we just printed right.

46
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,230
And become becoming your point python.

47
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,610
Python is a great programming language.

48
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,370
I'm learning how to under fire and python and so on so forth.

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,530
OK here we go.

50
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,830
It looks great.

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,800
All right.

52
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,260
The next step is let's assume that I wanted to only read one single line only.

53
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:49,960
So what I could say I was okay F equals to open and hit again to specify my underscore file the text

54
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:57,610
and I'm gonna open it for again for reading purposes but here I'm gonna say print and F instead of read.

55
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,140
So when I say f the treat only that would read the entire content of the text file here I could say

56
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,360
F only dot read line and that's it.

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,890
That will read simply the first line which is unbecoming point python.

58
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,510
All right.

59
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:10,820
Great.

60
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,830
OK.

61
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:12,770
All right.

62
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,770
Let's assume that I wanted for example instead of reading something I wanted to let's say create for

63
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,130
example a new file and maybe or maybe write something to it.

64
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,410
OK write something to my file in here which is my final text.

65
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,100
OK.

66
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,430
All right.

67
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,290
So what I could do.

68
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,340
I'm going to say okay F equals to open and then open my file again and then which is my file.

69
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,260
But what I'm gonna do here I'm going to open again stop the text obviously and I'm gonna open it.

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,770
Not for writing writing purposes.

71
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,820
I can open it for here in this case for appending purpose.

72
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,160
A guy's go up here in front of the reading purposes that is append if you wanted to let's say append

73
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,010
or add for example additional information to a file.

74
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,430
Okay.

75
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,210
And afterwards I'm going to say okay f dot instead of read actually gonna write to it and you can write

76
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,000
whatever you want.

77
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,920
So here that's a first of all make sure you actually can close that file.

78
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,480
So let's close it Casey open it for appending purposes and then here you can write let's say

79
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:20,040
I am learning python and will be a pro soon.

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,180
Something like that something.

81
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,250
OK.

82
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,880
All right let's let's shift enter.

83
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,720
Here we go.

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,430
And here you find that Python basically kind of returned back to tell you OK.

85
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,390
Fully three it's kind of you know like a confirmation code.

86
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,770
All right.

87
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,740
So let's take a look at the file so I could do you and say OK let's go here.

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,500
Open my file.

89
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,450
And here we go.

90
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,820
You'll find that the file of the original file contains only that information before.

91
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,890
Now I added I am learning python and will be a pro soon which is simply what we have just added in here.

92
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,060
OK.

93
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,720
All right.

94
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,100
OK.

95
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,110
So what we need to do afterwards after we actually write something to it or read something from it.

96
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,220
We have to make sure that I should close the file.

97
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:01,440
So going to say actually it's close the actual file here and we have to say f dot close to actually

98
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,430
close the file.

99
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,340
All right.

100
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,290
Looks good actually do it in a separate file and sort of appending new information at the close.

101
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,940
That's a close the file and that should basically conclude what we wanted to learn in here.

102
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,820
So in this section we're able to actually open the file read text into it we're able to as well read

103
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,470
specific line from it and we're able as well to write information if you wanted to append information

104
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,790
to the file.

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,110
What I'm asking us to do is to please write your name into my file the text I just wanted to you to

106
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,250
simply open the file for writing purposes appending purposes and then write let's say your name and

107
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,680
please make sure that you know like you close the file afterwards go ahead pause the video and I'll

108
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,600
see you guys after the challenge.

109
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,070
All right.

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,980
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge when ask us to do is to simply go ahead open.

111
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,360
Pretty much what we have done here.

112
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,680
So going to do this and maybe at the close as well.

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,080
But he did ask us to maybe write your name so here we're just gonna write maybe like like Ryan for example

114
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,130
simplicity okay.

115
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,100
All right.

116
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,810
You can call it whatever whatever you want.

117
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,800
So here I open my file for appending purposes I wrote whatever I wanted here and then closed the file

118
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:22,920
shift enter Okay looks good maybe go back and check on our file which is my file.

119
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,410
The text all right.

120
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,340
And here we go.

121
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,090
You will find that there is Ryan simplicity have been added here at the end.

122
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,360
Right.

123
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,770
Obviously you guys should be able to see your name or whatever you wrote here.

124
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,260
They should be able to see it.

125
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,850
And that's pretty much all we have for this lecture I hope you guys enjoyed it in the next lecture.

126
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,440
I'm going to walk you through how to create in your file from scratch and how to do maybe some couple

127
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,620
of you know like mixed files operations with some for loops.

128
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,750
Best of luck and I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
