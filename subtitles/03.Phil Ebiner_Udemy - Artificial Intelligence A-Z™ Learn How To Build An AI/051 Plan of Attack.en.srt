00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,980
Hello and welcome back to the course on artificial intelligence.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,550
And today's section we're going to tackle deep convolutional CULE learning.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,860
So we're taking a deep learning too even a further step so we originally started to cool earning the

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,650
simple learning.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,840
Then we took that to deep learning and now we're taking too deep convolutional learn.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,960
So let's see what we're going to discuss in terms of intuition.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,200
Different sections are going to be quite quick.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:33,730
There's not much that we need to add as long as we're familiar with convolutional neural networks and

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,940
we'll touch on this towards the end of this trial.

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,770
So today in this section we're going to talk about deep relationship learning the intuition behind things

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:49,960
and why it's so powerful why exactly it's so important to move away from deep Kule learning and why

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,500
deep learning is just a basic building block where it's just a step for us on the postes to deep relationship

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,710
learning and what kind of avenues deep can Lucian convolutional CULE learning opens up to what kind

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,020
of avenues the knowledge opens up to and where it can be applied.

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,590
We'll have some examples of that and then we'll talk about eligibility.

16
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:19,740
Trace or end step learning a very powerful addition to the whole concept of deep learning.

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,820
And we'll talk about the intuition behind that.

18
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,140
It's quite a complex topic but nevertheless we'll break down the intuition in quite simple terms and

19
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,350
then I'll give you some additional references where you can read up about eligibility Tracy if you'd

20
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,120
like to go into more detail but it is important for us to get the intuition down pat because we're going

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,510
to be using that in practical terms because we're delving into much more complex topics now that we

22
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:53,260
need to be add these extra or extra elements to our agents or to our learning algorithms so that they

23
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,100
can actually handle these complex environments and navigate them successfully.

24
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:05,380
And of course in this section because we're talking about convolutional neural networks it is highly

25
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,300
advisable that you check out an x number to convolutional neural networks.

26
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,460
Once again if you've done deep learning aitches at course then you already you're already familiar with

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,510
this information so you can safely proceed with these tutorials on the deep emotional Kule learning.

28
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,790
If you haven't done the deep learning aitches of course then it's a great idea to look at convolutional

29
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,540
neural networks and look at those intuitions.

30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:36,820
Charles there so you understand better how images are processed by neural networks in order to look

31
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:44,290
for features and what's the whole convolutional layers are about pooling Lares the flattening layers

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,190
and how all that works in order to come up with some parameters about that describe the environment

33
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,710
or that describe that image and therefore we're going to be using those as inputs into our neural networks

34
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,300
instead of that vector which we're talking about.

35
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,020
But more on that in the next tutorial.

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,610
So if you haven't seen those controls yet we will advise you to check them out to get up to speed with

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,460
or refresh knowledge on Cullerton illusional neural networks.

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,180
All in all we've got an exciting section and as you can see what that many intuition Tournelles meaning

39
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,850
that you can.

40
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,860
You'll be able to jump into the practical side of things very quickly.

41
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,430
So on that note I've always seen the first tutorial.

42
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,660
And until then enjoy AI.
