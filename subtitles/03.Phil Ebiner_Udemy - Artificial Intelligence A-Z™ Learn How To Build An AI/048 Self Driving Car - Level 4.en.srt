00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello and welcome to the final level of the self-driving car challenge.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,310
So this time my goal will be to beat the self-driving car not the level four because I want to challenge

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:18,330
you into improving the curves improving the AI or maybe improving the strategy so that you can beat

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,010
this challenge yourself.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:28,240
So I'm going to make a highly complex road that will still go from the airport to the downtown but maybe

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,050
too complicated for the car to find its way.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,190
So that will be my challenge so that I hope we can have fun with the challenging homework.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's do this let's approach this level.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,520
So let's select everything then let's load the brain and there we go.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,930
Now with the round trips between the airport and the downtown.

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,220
So it's going to take some time so I'm just going to put on some music and here we go with the road.

12
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,400
And there we go.

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,480
Here is the road.

14
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,170
And as you can see the car seems to have a lot of trouble.

15
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,940
So that's exactly what I wanted.

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,590
It's you know doing these little round trips in the same part of the road.

17
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,700
That's a problem.

18
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,570
It doesn't find its way right now to the downtown.

19
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,340
So how can we fix this.

20
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:58,070
Can we do need to change the strategy or do we need to change the parameters of the neural networks

21
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,980
that has changed the synopsis in the brain of the car.

22
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:10,940
Do we need to do something with the words you know maybe get a worse word when it's not finding the

23
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,730
goal as it is the case right now.

24
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:22,250
So so I don't know that for you to find out as you can see the rewards is not very severe when it's

25
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,340
not finding the goal.

26
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,370
You know it's not getting closer to the goal.

27
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,100
The reward is just minus 0.2.

28
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,910
That's not a severe bad reward.

29
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:39,300
You could try to decrease the reward even more like setting a reward equal to minus 0.5.

30
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,590
Maybe that will work.

31
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,730
And just throwing some suggestions to help you.

32
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,080
So that's a change you can make with the word strategy.

33
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,750
And then of course can make some other changes with your new network.

34
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,580
So you know in this section we create the architecture of the new network we choose to have 30 hidden

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,950
neurons in one hidden layer.

36
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:10,030
Maybe you can try to change the architecture by trying some more layers or some more hidden neurons

37
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,070
I don't know.

38
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,700
That's another suggestion for improvement.

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,290
And then you can also try to change something in a deep learning algorithm or something you can move

40
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,100
onto the course and find out about the other algorithms.

41
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,870
Maybe there is another one that will manage to handle this situation.

42
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,140
So good luck.

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,170
I look forward to seeing your solutions try to draw that same road that's perfect.

44
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,350
That's really pretty exciting enigma.

45
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:44,520
And if you want me to give you a hint or if you want me to explain quickly what the problem is.

46
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,100
Well you can see that right here.

47
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,450
When it reaches that point it's going back and that's because when it's reaching that point it's getting

48
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,800
too far away from the goal which right now is downtown.

49
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:02,410
You know when it's reaching that point if it goes further Well it will go further away from the goal.

50
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,630
So that's why it's going back here.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,400
And so you have to change something in the code something in the strategy to maybe punish it less when

52
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,660
it's getting further away from the goal.

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,100
Maybe that's the solution.

54
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm just throwing some suggestions.

55
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,540
I don't want to give you solution too fast but that would be a really good exercise.

56
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,880
And that's typically a problem that can be countered by engineers when they're making a self-driving

57
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,420
car.

58
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,870
But anyway I think that's a pretty cool enigma.

59
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,690
So I hope you will have fun and before solving this homework maybe you can do another very efficient

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,050
homework which would be simply to try to implement all this again.

61
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,140
You know just implement the exact same one that will be excellent practice because so far you've just

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,080
listened to my explanations but there is a huge difference between listening to something and try to

63
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,120
do the thing yourself.

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,690
Oh oh did you see what happened.

65
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,960
It just found its way.

66
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,090
That's amazing.

67
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,780
It's funny how it got out of it.

68
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,540
But I'm sure there is a better strategy to get out of it more efficiently.

69
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,220
And now it seems to be pretty good.

70
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,670
Maybe I'm speaking too fast maybe it's going to solve this.

71
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:11,980
No.

72
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,630
Here we go.

73
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,170
It's getting stuck here again.

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,210
That's pretty challenging for the car right.

75
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,630
But I'm sure this can be solved.

76
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,870
That's your go.

77
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,750
So good luck and please let me know about your solutions.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,540
And then I.
