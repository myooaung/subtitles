00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,480
Helen will come back to the course on artificial intelligence.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,760
In today's tutorial we're taking our first step into the world of A-3 see and as a first step we're

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,220
going to find out what disapprobation stands for.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,270
So A-3 C stands for a synchronous advantage.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,040
Actor critic algorithm.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,310
This is an algorithm which was developed at Google a deep mind in 2016 by a group of researchers and

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,760
it's the cutting edge algorithm for artificial intelligence.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,120
To date now it has multiple notifications and we'll discuss that more in the course especially in the

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,050
practical tutorials.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,000
But nevertheless this algorithm blows everything else including deep convolutional Q learning networks

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,870
out of the water completely out of the water and it is faster.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,300
It takes less time for training and gets better results.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,680
So throughout this part of the course we'll be referencing and we have already referenced by we'll be

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,140
referencing even more paper on the paper that was published that first introduced A-3 sea is called

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:09,030
the synchronous methods of deeper enforcement learning why Vladimir minae and others from Google deep

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:15,660
mine which show you this paper now so that you have a introduction to it so.

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:24,180
So here is this paper I wanted to show you so that you can get a feel for it and ready get introduced

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,180
to it a little bit.

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:33,270
And of course it is highly recommended to read through the paper and understand what's what exactly

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,900
they're talking about and you'll see that throughout the practical tutorials Adlon will be taking you

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:48,240
through certain parts of the paper through certain paragraphs or sections which will be relevant to

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,870
what will be programming at that point in time.

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,810
And what I wanted to point out here is like as you can see a lot of research went into this but and

24
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,890
there's a lot of references as well but like part of the area like is that at the end and they compare

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,950
the different algorithms compare the results and this is what I wanted to point out here.

26
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,450
So let's zoom in a little bit.

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,090
So here as you can see the even in Google deep mine their training or they're evaluating their algorithms

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,550
on games just as we're doing in the scores.

29
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,690
So exactly the same principle because games are a simulated environment or a small environment a confined

30
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,780
environment with certain rules and they want to understand how well this artificial intelligence doing

31
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,570
in those games.

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,080
And here we go.

33
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,670
Exactly.

34
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:43,200
All those games which you can find a lot of them you can find on open a gym and the games that we've

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,250
been working with.

36
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,940
So for instance in this section we're working with breakouts.

37
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,600
It's also here as you can see that for Breakout.

38
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,470
They've got in bold they've got the best algorithm highlighted so Dick un that's the algorithm we've

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:02,180
been working with and then some other algorithms and then you've got A-3 see through see if LSD long

40
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,540
or short term memory.

41
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,270
So that's the one we'll be implementing in this part of the course will be all have A-3 see with nÃ©lisse

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,270
team which makes it even stronger.

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,620
As you can see breakout is the best result is achieved by threes you fellows.

44
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,010
So that's the score.

45
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,680
Six six point eight compared to the others.

46
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:28,740
And also you can see that for most of them so if you now take a bigger picture view you can see that

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,990
most of the bold ones are actually in this last column.

48
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,990
So yes indeed there are some some games where other algorithms are performing better but as you can

49
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:43,890
see deep Dijk un is actually not performing better in any of the games but you can see that there are

50
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,600
other algorithms other algorithms perform better sometimes but A-3 cel ystem performs the best.

51
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,570
In most cases you can see that this ball this ball this one these wands this one and so on.

52
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,910
So you can see that atresia system is a really powerful algorithm.

53
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,430
It is indeed at the forefront of artificial intelligence and that's exactly what will be implementing.

54
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:15,600
So a very exciting section ahead highly encourage you to go through this paper and get really get a

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,170
feel for what we're going to be talking about.

56
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,650
And then throughout this section and throughout the especially the practical side of things practical

57
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,240
side of Stroh's we're going to be going through this in detail.

58
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,060
We're actually going to be working with their pseudo code here which is available and we're going to

59
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,470
be.

60
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,010
So I will show you how to implement that and how we're going to be working with it.

61
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,680
And on that note I hope you're going to enjoy this paper and I look forward to seeing you next time.

62
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,270
And until then enjoy AI.
