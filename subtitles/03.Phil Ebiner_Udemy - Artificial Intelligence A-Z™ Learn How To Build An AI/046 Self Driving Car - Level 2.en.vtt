00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.670
Hello and welcome to level two of our self-driving car A-game.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.250
All right.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.200
Are you ready to take level 2.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.310
Are you excited.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.640
Well me too.

6
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.810
Let's do this.

7
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.920
As you can notice I just quit the application but that's not a problem because we saved the last brain

8
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.740
so we're going to go back to the app and load the last brain and this will have the last weight of the

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.050
neural networks like you know it will have the last Sinapis of the brain.

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.820
So it will already know how to do the round trips between the airport and the downtown.

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.770
But now we're taking on the challenge of passing level 2.

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.870
So as a reminder Level two is to still do the round trips.

13
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.540
But by staying on a specific road that we will draw ourselves right now in the Statoil.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.740
So let's see if it can do that.

15
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.440
Let's make this road simple because then remember that Level 4 is a highly complicated road.

16
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.150
So for now that still be nice with our self-driving car.

17
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.470
All right let's do this.

18
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.840
It's already selected and going to select that over again.

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.900
And let's try to beat level 2.

20
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.990
There we go.

21
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.550
It's doing the weird spinning for us but that's because I didn't know that.

22
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.030
Let's load the brain and there we go.

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.350
Now it should be OK.

24
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.520
Yes it is.

25
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.160
It's doing the round trips between the airport.

26
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.950
There we go.

27
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.820
And now to downtown.

28
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.890
It's going into the downtown and perfect and now doing the other round trips.

29
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.520
All right.

30
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.700
So that's level one.

31
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.950
And now let's take care of level two.

32
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.100
So I'm going to draw a road something like this so let me think what to draw.

33
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.240
It has to be simple.

34
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.560
So what about what about something like this.

35
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.380
I told you I'm not a very good architect.

36
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.740
But I am trying to do something not too difficult.

37
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.520
Something like that.

38
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.440
What do you think.

39
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.560
All right.

40
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.520
So that's the other order of the road.

41
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.520
No something like this.

42
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.900
And there we go.

43
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.340
All right.

44
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.280
Pretty good.

45
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.560
Well that's a classic road but OK.

46
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.480
So it's in the road.

47
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.350
Perfect.

48
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.670
And so now the challenge is not to cross some sand.

49
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.920
So here we go.

50
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.780
First mistake.

51
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.970
But it's going to learn from this mistake and try not to do it again.

52
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.540
If we actually save the brain we can see the mistake probably.

53
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.750
Yes.

54
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.680
If we look at here well we see the mistakes it made here.

55
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.340
That's where it crossed some sand probably.

56
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.880
So there we go.

57
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.100
Right now it's on the road and it's reaching the goals.

58
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.000
Right now it just reached the downtown and going back on the road to reach the airport.

59
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.660
There we go.

60
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.360
Perfect Job well done.

61
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.170
So it seems that level 2 is passed already.

62
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.520
Didn't take much time to do the training.

63
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.290
So that's great.

64
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.050
That's great.

65
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.770
We can take it to the next level now.

66
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.030
Yes indeed.

67
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.050
The round trips looks perfect.

68
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.140
We can still send some bit of hesitation.

69
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.170
Maybe we can still increase the temperature.

70
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.080
But you know it's reaching the goals and staying on the road.

71
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.720
It's not crossing any sense.

72
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.450
So that's definitely a self-driving car.

73
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.310
So pretty exciting but now I want to make it more difficult for the self-driving car.

74
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.880
We want to take it to level three which will.

75
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.910
Oh here we go.

76
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.620
A mistake.

77
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.400
Sorry about that.

78
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.480
I thought it was already one game.

79
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.850
But you know it can still make some mistake actually.

80
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.420
We say you can probably see a constant war.

81
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.820
Close to 0.1.

82
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.510
There we go.

83
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.410
And that's probably the mistake.

84
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.100
But anyway it's doing a great job right now.

85
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.970
So we will take it to level 3 and level three will be to draw some obstacles but some difficult obstacles

86
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.190
to the car and the car will have to find its way to the downtown in the airport by avoiding the obstacles.

87
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.820
So it will be obstacles full of sand of course but it will have to avoid them and finally goes the airport

88
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.860
and the downtown.

89
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.670
So let's see if we can do that.

90
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.830
And until next time enjoy.

91
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.240
I.
