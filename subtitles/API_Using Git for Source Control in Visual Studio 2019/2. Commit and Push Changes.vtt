00:00:01.811 --> 00:00:05.811
In this demonstration, you will learn how to commit and push changes.

2
00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:08.841
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:12.831
As you can see, we are working now with my user account.

4
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:14.851
I haven't opened a solution yet,

5
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.441
so let's go to Team Explorer and let's click on the

6
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.771
plug to manage the connections.

7
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:25.811
Let's double-click on the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository to open it.

8
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:28.286
Now let's double-click on the

9
00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:31.781
WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool solution to open this solution.

10
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.995
Let's go back to the Solution Explorer and you can see

11
00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.801
we have opened now the solution.

12
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:41.781
Now we will implement the head command for the coffee shop info tool.

13
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:43.761
To implement that head command,

14
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:46.841
we need to add the Wired Brain Coffee data access class library

15
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:49.841
that provides the data about the coffee shops.

16
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:54.841
So let's right-click on the solution and let's select here Add, New Project.

17
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:59.801
In the new project dialog, let's search here for .NET Standard,

18
00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:02.168
and let's select here the .NET Standard Class

19
00:01:02.168 --> 00:01:04.831
Library template and let's click Next.

20
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.841
Let's call the class library WiredBrainCoffee.DataAccess,

21
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.821
and let's click the Create button to create it.

22
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.811
Now let's go to the Solution Explorer and let's remove this Class1 file.

23
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:20.804
Let's right-click on the DataAccess project and then select Add,

24
00:01:20.804 --> 00:01:23.831
New Folder, and let's call the new folder Model.

25
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:27.811
Let's right-click that folder and then select Add, Class.

26
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:31.668
And let's call the class CoffeeShop and let's click

27
00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.761
the Add button to add this class.

28
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:37.378
Let's make this class public, and let me paste the properties,

29
00:01:37.378 --> 00:01:40.791
location, and BeansInStock in kilograms.

30
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:44.273
Let's also put the cursor on the usings and let's press

31
00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:46.841
Ctrl+dot to remove the unnecessary usings.

32
00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:48.851
Now let's go again to the Solution Explorer,

33
00:01:48.851 --> 00:01:51.811
let's right-click the DataAccess project,

34
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.851
and let's add another class.

35
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:58.172
Let's call this class the CoffeeShopDataProvider and

36
00:01:58.172 --> 00:02:00.821
let's click the Add button to add it.

37
00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:02.781
Let's make this class public,

38
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:06.784
and let me just paste a LoadCoffeeShops method that returns

39
00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:09.761
the information about three coffee shops.

40
00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:13.041
Let's put the cursor on the CoffeeShop class and let's press Ctrl+dot to

41
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.851
add a using for WiredBrainCoffee.DataAccess .Model.

42
00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:19.283
Let's place the cursor on the usings and let's press

43
00:02:19.283 --> 00:02:21.771
Ctrl+dot to remove the unnecessary usings.

44
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:24.851
Now let's go to the Program.cs file of the console app

45
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:27.821
and let's implement the head command.

46
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:32.791
I just add here a line break and I paste in the logic for the head command.

47
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:35.801
Let me put the cursor on the CoffeeShopDataProvider class,

48
00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:37.761
let's press Ctrl+dot,

49
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:42.761
and let's add a reference to the WiredBrainCoffee.DataAccess project.

50
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.761
Now let me show you the code that I've added here.

51
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.771
Here I create a new CoffeeShopDataProvider instance

52
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:50.841
and then I start the while loop.

53
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:52.841
We read the line from the console,

54
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:57.811
and then we load the coffee shops by using the coffeeShopDataProvider.

55
00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:00.821
If the line from the console is the string help,

56
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.821
then we write to the console, Available coffee shop commands.

57
00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:08.821
Then we print out the location of each coffee shop.

58
00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.811
Let's see this in action and let's run the tool.

59
00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.781
Let's type in help and let's press Enter,

60
00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:17.568
and you can see available coffee shop commands Frankfurt,

61
00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:19.811
Freiburg, and Munich.

62
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.761
Okay, so the feature is implemented.

63
00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:25.781
Now let's commit and push our changes.

64
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:30.781
So let's go to Team Explorer and let's click here on Changes.

65
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:31.851
As you can see, by default,

66
00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:35.791
Team Explorer displaced the changed files in a hierarchy

67
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:37.851
so you can see the folder structure,

68
00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:41.344
but you can click here on the three dots and you can switch to a

69
00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:45.781
list view to see the changed files in a flat list.

70
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:50.761
But personally, I prefer the preview, so let's switch back to the preview.

71
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:54.761
What's also great to know is that you can see the changed files

72
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.781
with this red check in the Solution Explorer.

73
00:03:57.781 --> 00:04:00.851
Edit files have a green plus in front of them.

74
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:04.781
You can also right-click files in the Solution Explorer,

75
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.448
and here you find Git actions like Undo,

76
00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:09.974
Commit, View History, Compare with Unmodified,

77
00:04:09.974 --> 00:04:10.851
and Blame.

78
00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:15.851
When you click on Commit, the Changes page of Team Explorer opens up.

79
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:20.131
Another powerful feature to navigate to Team Explorer and

80
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:22.851
to this Changes page is the status bar.

81
00:04:22.851 --> 00:04:27.781
Here in the status bar, you can see that we have six changes.

82
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:32.771
When you click this, Team Explorer opens up with the Changes page.

83
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:33.851
Now when you look at the changes,

84
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:38.791
you can see that added files have the add suffix.

85
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:41.851
If you don't see that suffix, like on the Program.cs file,

86
00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:45.781
it means this file was modified.

87
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:47.811
When you right-click and edit file,

88
00:04:47.811 --> 00:04:51.791
you'll see you can't compare it with the unmodified version

89
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.841
because there was no unmodified version available.

90
00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:57.811
But when you right-click the Program.cs file,

91
00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:00.841
you can select here Compare with Unmodified.

92
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:05.811
Now you can see actually in Visual Studio what you have changed.

93
00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:06.801
As you can see,

94
00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:11.771
we have added a using directive for the WiredBrainCoffee.DataAccess namespace,

95
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.851
and then we have added here the code to implement the help command.

96
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:17.851
Also from the Solution Explorer,

97
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.714
you can right-click the Program.cs file and you can select here

98
00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:24.821
Compare with Unmodified to see the changes.

99
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:29.781
Now let's go back to the Team Explorer and let's commit our changes.

100
00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:31.821
Let's enter here a commit message.

101
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:35.801
Let's write Implement help command.

102
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:39.821
Now you have here the button Commit All, but this is also a drop-down.

103
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:44.441
You can see you can also commit all changes locally and then

104
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.821
push the changes to the remote repository.

105
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:49.781
You can also select Commit All and Sync,

106
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:51.831
which means you commit locally,

107
00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:55.781
then the changes from the remote repository are pulled,

108
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:59.831
and after that you've pushed all the changes to the remote repository.

109
00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:00.831
When you commit,

110
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:05.851
Visual Studio will automatically stage all the changed files that you see here,

111
00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:11.771
but maybe you want to stage files explicitly to create separate commits.

112
00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.781
For example, in this case,

113
00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:18.811
I want to create a separate commit for the added DataAccess project.

114
00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:21.801
So let's right-click here the WiredBrainCoffee.DataAccess

115
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:24.841
folder and let's select here Stage.

116
00:06:24.841 --> 00:06:29.124
Now you can see we have staged changes that go into the

117
00:06:29.124 --> 00:06:31.801
current commit and we have other changes.

118
00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:36.801
Let's also stage the solution file as we have added a new project.

119
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:39.811
So let's select here Stage from the context menu.

120
00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:41.841
Now let's enter a commit message.

121
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:47.771
Let's write here, Add data access project to solution.

122
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:50.801
Now, again, you can commit the staged changes locally.

123
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:53.781
You can also push or you can sync.

124
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:56.791
Let's click Commit Staged to commit the changes locally.

125
00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.821
Now you can see here the leftover changes.

126
00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:01.771
In the CS project file,

127
00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:05.791
we have added a reference to the DataAccess project that we needed to

128
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:08.801
implement the head command in the Program.cs file.

129
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:13.791
So let's write here the commit message, Implement help command,

130
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:15.851
and let's click Commit All.

131
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:18.831
Now we have all the changes committed.

132
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:23.023
So when you go to the Branches page and you right-click here on

133
00:07:23.023 --> 00:07:25.811
the master branch and you select View History,

134
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:28.851
you can see the two commits that we have just created,

135
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:33.821
Add data access project to solution and Implement help command.

136
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:38.811
To push the commits, you go to Synchronization page of Team Explorer.

137
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:42.781
Here you can see that we have two Outgoing Commits.

138
00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:44.781
Usually before you push,

139
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:48.851
you check if there are Incoming Commits by clicking here on Fetch.

140
00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:52.771
There is no Incoming Commit, so we can push.

141
00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:56.761
But before we click here on Push, let's close Team Explorer.

142
00:07:56.761 --> 00:08:02.761
You can also see down here in the Status bar that we have two un-pushed commits.

143
00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:03.801
So when you click this,

144
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:08.821
Team Explorer comes back and you are directly on the Synchronization page.

145
00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:15.781
Now let's click here on Push to push these two commits to the remote repository.

146
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:20.781
We have successfully pushed now the two commits to the remote master branch.

147
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:32.000
In the next clip, we will switch to the user Julia. You will see how she fetches and pulls the changes from the remote repository.
