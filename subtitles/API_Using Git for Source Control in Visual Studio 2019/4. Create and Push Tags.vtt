00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:05.771
In this demonstration, you will learn how to create and push tags.

2
00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:09.741
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:12.701
As you can see, we work as Julia.

4
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:17.711
In the previous clip, she has implemented the PaperCupsInStock feature.

5
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:19.791
She has merged her changes to the master branch.

6
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.761
As you can see, we are here on the master branch.

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:28.761
Let's click on this branch in the status bar and let's select here View History.

8
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.094
Here in this history,

9
00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:35.345
you can see that Julia has added the PaperCupsInStock property and then

10
00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:38.771
she has merged that feature to the master branch.

11
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:43.731
Now she wants to create a tag for this latest commit of the master branch.

12
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.781
So let's go to Team Explorer.

13
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.791
As you can see, Team Explorer has here a Tags page.

14
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:53.791
So let's click on this to navigate to the Tags page.

15
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.711
Here you can click on New Tag to create a new tag.

16
00:00:57.711 --> 00:00:58.751
Let's do this.

17
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:00.741
Let's enter a tag name.

18
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:05.741
Let's say this is version 0.5, and let's enter a tag message.

19
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:10.781
Let's write here Version 0.5 with paper cups in stock.

20
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:14.761
Then you can say here that you want to create a tag against the

21
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:17.761
latest commit this current branch points to,

22
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.791
and you can click the Create Tag button to create the tag.

23
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.741
So let's click it.

24
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:26.731
Now you see we have here the tag version 0.5.

25
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:31.731
Let's go back to this history view, and let's click here the refresh button.

26
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.791
Now you can see the tag also in this history view.

27
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:38.721
If you don't want to see tags here, you can click this button.

28
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:41.791
So when I click this, you see the tag disappears.

29
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:44.771
Let's check it again to see the tags.

30
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:50.711
You can also create tags directly in this history view for any commit.

31
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:51.751
So let's say, for example,

32
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:54.997
that we want to create a tag for this commit where

33
00:01:54.997 --> 00:01:56.771
Thomas has implemented the quit command,

34
00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:59.741
and also the help message from Julia.

35
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:03.781
So let's right-click this commit and let's select here Create Tag.

36
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:06.731
Now we are, again, in the Team Explorer,

37
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:11.721
and now we are here in the Create Tag section for this current commit.

38
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:14.751
So let me just cancel this, and let's go to home.

39
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:18.721
Instead of using the Create Tag context menu in this history view,

40
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.711
let's just double-click the commit,

41
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:23.781
and this will open the Commit Details in Team Explorer.

42
00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:26.751
Let me pin this so that you can see this.

43
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:31.751
When I double-click a commit, you can see it opens up in Team Explorer.

44
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:36.731
So now let's select this commit, and now let's click here on Create Tag.

45
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:37.761
Let me cancel again.

46
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:40.721
Let's right-click, and let's select Create Tag,

47
00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:43.496
and you will see that it just opens up this create

48
00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.761
tag view on the current commit.

49
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:49.741
I click it, and you see the create tag view is open.

50
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.741
Now let's enter here a tag name.

51
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:56.711
Let's call it version 0.4, and let's enter here the tag message,

52
00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:59.781
Version 0.4 with quit command.

53
00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:03.761
Now let's click on Create Tag to create this new tag.

54
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:08.711
Let's unpin Team Explorer, and let's click refresh in the history view,

55
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.479
and now you can see this tag also here on that

56
00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.721
commit that we have just selected.

57
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.751
Now Julia wants to push these tags to the remote repository.

58
00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:22.751
So let's go to Team Explorer, and let's navigate to the Tags page.

59
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:28.721
Here in the Tags page, you can right-click a tag to push that tag individually,

60
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.331
or you can click up here on Push All to push all the

61
00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:34.701
local tags to the remote repository.

62
00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:35.721
Let's do this.

63
00:03:35.721 --> 00:03:40.771
Let's click here on Push All, and now you see Successfully pushed to origin.

64
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:45.408
Now imagine your customers are using version 0.4 of

65
00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:49.751
the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool, and they found a bug in your software.

66
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:54.711
Then you can create a branch from the tag to implement a hotfix on that branch.

67
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:55.728
As you can see,

68
00:03:55.728 --> 00:04:00.711
here you can just select a tag version from which you want to create a branch.

69
00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:03.701
All right, so far to tags.

70
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:04.231
In the next clip,

71
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:13.000
we will switch back to the user Thomas and we will continue to work on the coffee shop commands feature branch.
