00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.989
In this demonstration, you will learn how to create and checkout a branch.

2
00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:09.939
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

3
00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.009
As you can see, we work now with my user account as user Thomas.

4
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.728
I've opened here Team Explorer and you can see I have opened

5
00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:21.959
the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository.

6
00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.999
Now let's implement the coffee shop commands for this coffee shop info tool.

7
00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.999
To do this, let's don't create the commits on the master branch,

8
00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.631
instead let's create a separate branch for that feature so that

9
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:39.309
we can work isolated on that feature without being affected by

10
00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.959
other commits on the master branch.

11
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:46.969
To create a branch, you just go to the Branches page of Team Explorer.

12
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.009
Here you can click on New Branch.

13
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.676
You just need to enter a name here and you need to select the

14
00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:54.989
branch from which you want to branch off.

15
00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.009
In this case, we want to branch off master.

16
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.939
So now let's give our new branch a name.

17
00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:06.019
Let's call it feature/coffeeShopCommands.

18
00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:08.949
As you can see, here is a checkbox.

19
00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:09.979
When you have this checked,

20
00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.939
the branch will automatically be checked out after it was created.

21
00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.029
Let me uncheck this checkbox and let's click on Create Branch.

22
00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:23.959
Now you can see here our new coffeeShopCommands branch.

23
00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.989
To switch to this branch, you need to check it out.

24
00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:30.691
You can do this by right-clicking this branch and select

25
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:32.949
here Checkout from the context menu.

26
00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:37.029
Or you can also just double-click this branch and now it's checked out.

27
00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:39.999
You can see that branch is now bold.

28
00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.019
The bold branch is the one you have checked out.

29
00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.979
Instead of using Team Explorer to switch between branches,

30
00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.019
you can also use Visual Studio's status bar.

31
00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:55.009
Down here, you can see that we are now on the feature/coffeeShopCommands branch.

32
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.029
When you click on this, you see also different branch options.

33
00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:03.299
You can view the history of the current branch or you can click,

34
00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.949
for example, here Manage Branches,

35
00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:08.029
which will bring you to the Branches page of Team Explorer.

36
00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:12.969
At the top, you can see the local branches that are on your machine.

37
00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.989
So now you can click here on master to check out the master branch.

38
00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.430
Now you can see in Team Explorer that the master branch

39
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.969
is checked out because it is bold.

40
00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.749
You can also see down here in the status bar that we

41
00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.999
have checked out the master branch.

42
00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.646
Now let's use the status bar again to check out our

43
00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:33.979
feature/coffeeShopCommands branch.

44
00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.009
Now let's actually implement the coffee shop commands.

45
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:42.019
So let's go to the Solution Explorer and let's open up the Program.cs file.

46
00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.959
Let's scroll down here to the if statement where we handled the head command.

47
00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.999
If the use didn't enter the string help, it is a coffee shop command.

48
00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.969
So let's enter here an else block,

49
00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.999
and now let's implement here the logic to handle the coffee shop commands.

50
00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:03.009
I have already prepared that logic, so I just paste it here into this else block.

51
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.720
Let me put the cursor here on the where method and let's press

52
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.959
Ctrl+dot to add a using for System.Linq.

53
00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.009
Now let's go through this code.

54
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:13.096
As you can see,

55
00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:16.442
here we grabbed all the coffee shops where the location starts with

56
00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:19.999
a line that the user has entered in the console.

57
00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.999
Then, we check the found coffee shops.

58
00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.999
If 0 coffee shops were found,

59
00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.969
we print out that the command that the user has entered was not found.

60
00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.979
If one coffee shop was found,

61
00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:36.345
we grab that single coffee shop from the found coffee shops list and we

62
00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.029
write the Location and the Beans in stock to the console.

63
00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:42.029
Else, if more than one coffee shop was found,

64
00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.989
we print out multiple matching coffee shop commands found.

65
00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.009
Then we write the location of all the found coffee shops to the console.

66
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.969
So let's see if this works, and let's run the application.

67
00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.959
Let's type in help, and now you can see the available coffee shop commands.

68
00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.989
Let's type in Thomas, as this is not an available coffee shop command.

69
00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.009
Now you can see Command Thomas not found.

70
00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:08.969
Now let's type in Munich, let's hit Enter,

71
00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:12.442
and now you can see that we have 56 kilograms of

72
00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:14.979
coffee beans in stock in Munich.

73
00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.009
Now let's type in just fr,

74
00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.029
and now we can see that multiple matching coffee shop commands were found,

75
00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.959
Frankfurt and Freiburg.

76
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:26.969
So I could just type in here frank, and I hit Enter,

77
00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:32.989
and now you can see that 107 kg of coffee beans are in stock in Frankfurt.

78
00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:33.410
Great!

79
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.949
Now let's use the quit command to exit the application.

80
00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.029
So everything works as expected.

81
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:43.989
Now let's go to Team Explorer to commit our changes.

82
00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:47.959
Let's use the status bar to navigate to the Changes page.

83
00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:50.989
As you can see, we have here one change.

84
00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:55.969
Let's click on it, and now we are on the Changes page of Team Explorer.

85
00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.949
Let's enter here the commit message, Handle coffee shop commands.

86
00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.999
Now let's use here the drop-down and let's select Commit All and Push.

87
00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.949
Now you can see here the outgoing commit,

88
00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.029
and now we successfully pushed the branch feature/coffeeShopCommands to origin,

89
00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.969
which is the remote repository.

90
00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.625
Let's go to the Branches page of Team Explorer and

91
00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.009
let's expand here remotes/origin.

92
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.502
Now you can see that the feature coffeeShopCommands

93
00:05:25.502 --> 00:05:27.979
branch is in our remote repository.

94
00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:28.999
Great!

95
00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:37.000
In the next clip, we will continue with the user Julia. She will work on another feature.
