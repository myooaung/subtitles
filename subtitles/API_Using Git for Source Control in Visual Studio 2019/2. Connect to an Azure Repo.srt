1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:05,535
In this demonstration, you will learn how to connect to an Azure Repo.

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:10,515
An Azure Repo is a Git repository that is hosted in Azure DevOps.

3
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:14,455
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

4
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:17,485
As you can see, we work now as user Thomas.

5
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:21,316
Now let's go to the Connect page of Team Explorer by clicking here

6
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:24,485
on this little plug to manage the connections.

7
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:27,505
Here you can manage your local Git repositories.

8
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:31,515
Up here you see also a Hosted Service Providers section.

9
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:37,485
You can click here on Connect to connect to an Azure Repo, so let's do this.

10
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:41,515
When you click on Connect, this dialog opens up to connect to a project.

11
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:47,505
As you can see, it shows the hosted repositories for my Microsoft account.

12
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,465
You can see here that I am part of the two organizations,

13
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:54,465
thomasclaudiushuber and wiredbraincoffee.

14
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:58,465
Here is the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository.

15
00:00:58,465 --> 00:00:59,535
Let's select this.

16
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:04,505
Visual Studio detects that we have this repository already under this path,

17
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:09,455
so it just shows here a Connect button to connect to the Azure Repo.

18
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:12,485
But if I would change that path, let's add a tool here,

19
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:15,485
you can see this button changes to Clone.

20
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:20,495
Now it would clone the repository to this path and it would also connect to it.

21
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:24,535
But let me remove these two again, and let's click here on the Connect button.

22
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:28,975
Now you can see that we are connected to the

23
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:32,485
WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository from Azure DevOps.

24
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:35,515
Let's go again to the Connect page of Team Explorer.

25
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:39,887
You can see here in bold the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool from Azure

26
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:44,465
DevOps and here the local Git repository that is used.

27
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,495
Now let's go back to the Home page.

28
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:47,695
On the Home page,

29
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:52,475
you'll find a few new sections that come from the Azure DevOps service.

30
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:56,475
You can manage now in addition from Team Explorer Work Items,

31
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,515
Builds, and Pull Requests.

32
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:00,545
As you might remember from the previous module,

33
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:04,495
Thomas worked on this feature/coffeeShopCommands branch

34
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:06,545
that you see down here in the status bar.

35
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:10,505
Now the user Thomas wants to send a pull request to Julia,

36
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:15,525
so let's click here on Pull Requests to go to the new Pull Requests page.

37
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,620
You can see here in this section the pull requests

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,495
that were requested by Thomas,

39
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:25,485
and you can see here the pull requests that are assigned to Thomas.

40
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:29,495
At the top, you have here this action to create a new pull request,

41
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:31,515
so let's click on it.

42
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,535
Now you see my browser opens up,

43
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:38,510
and we are here on the page in Azure DevOps to create a new pull request to

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,485
match the feature/coffeeShopCommands branch into master.

45
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:45,535
But now let me close the browser.

46
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:48,721
Instead of navigating to the browser when you click on

47
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,515
this New Pull Request action here,

48
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:55,455
you can also create a new pull request directly in Visual Studio.

49
00:02:55,455 --> 00:03:05,000
To do this, you need to install the Pull Requests for Visual Studio extension. Let's do this in the next clip.
