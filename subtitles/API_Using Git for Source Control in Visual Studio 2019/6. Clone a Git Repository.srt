1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,437
So far you learned in this module how to create a local Git

2
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:10,153
repository with my user account and how to push it to a

3
00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:12,220
remote repository in Azure DevOps.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,200
In this clip, we won't use my user account anymore.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Instead, we will continue as Julia Developer.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,769
You will see now how she clones the Git repository from

7
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:27,180
Azure DevOps locally to her machine.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,230
So, in this demonstration, you'll learn how to clone a Git repository.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,260
Let's switch to Visual Studio.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,210
Here you can see the start window of Visual Studio 2019.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,823
Now let's click here on Clone or check out code to

12
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:44,200
clone the repository from Azure DevOps.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,961
In this window,

14
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:51,230
you just need to paste the repository URL and you need to specify a local path.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,260
As you can see, there is also a special section for Azure DevOps.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,240
When you click on this, a dialog opens up.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,260
You can specify here your Microsoft account.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,240
As you can see, we are logged in as Julia Developer.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,200
Then you can see here the organizations to which this account was added.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Julia is part of the Wired Brain Coffee organization.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,237
So here she could select the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool

22
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:20,770
repository and she could clone it locally to this path by

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,270
clicking the Clone button.

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,230
But let's cancel and let's use here the approach with the

25
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,190
repository URL that works with any Git service.

26
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,250
So let's open up Azure DevOps to copy the repository URL.

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,590
As you can see,

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,550
we are logged in here as Julia Developer and she is part

29
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,250
of the Wired Brain Coffee organization.

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,685
Now let's hover the Tools project and let's click here

31
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:48,180
on the icon for the Azure repos.

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,230
This brings us directly to the page with the repository.

33
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:57,210
So now you can click here on Clone and you can just copy the repository URL.

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,230
Let's go back to Visual Studio.

35
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,260
Here in the start window, let's just paste that URL,

36
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,270
and you can see the local path is now Julia\ WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool.

37
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,240
This looks good to me.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,270
So let's click now the Clone button to close the repository.

39
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,270
The Connect page of Team Explorer is shown,

40
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,210
and you can see it is cloning the repository.

41
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,180
Now the repository was cloned and we are switched to the Solution Explorer.

42
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,230
Here you can see the folder view of the cloned solution.

43
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,230
You can click on this little icon to switch to the solution view.

44
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,210
So let's click it.

45
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,270
Now you can see the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool solution is opened.

46
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,240
You can go to Team Explorer, you click on Home,

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,326
let's go to the Branches, let's right-click master,

48
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:47,220
and let's view the history.

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,260
Here Julia can see the two commits Thomas has made.

50
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,250
Let's click on Manage Connections here to go to the Connections page.

51
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,260
Here you can see now this local repository.

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,200
If you want to clone another repository, you can open up the start window again.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,180
To do this, you just go to the File menu, and here you see Start Window.

54
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,298
So you can click on it,

55
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:14,190
and then you can again click here on Clone or check out code.

56
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,250
As you know, this brings you to this view.

57
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,250
Let's close it again and let's go again to the File menu.

58
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,700
There is also a menu point, Clone or checkout code,

59
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:31,180
that opens up directly this view where you can paste in a Git repository URL.

60
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,240
Instead of using this window,

61
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,230
you can also clone a Git repository directly in Team Explorer.

62
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,190
Just go to the Connections page and here you see Clone.

63
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,180
So when you click this, you can also enter here a Git repository URL.

64
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,260
Let's use this approach now.

65
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,210
So let's go to my browser.

66
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,250
You can see I have opened here github.com /dotnet/wpf.

67
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,180
Let's click here on Clone or download and let's copy the repository URL.

68
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,190
Let's go back to Visual Studio.

69
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,220
Let's paste the URL here and let's clone the repository to julia\wpf.

70
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,220
Now you can see the repository here,

71
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,240
you can just double-click it to open this repository in Team Explorer.

72
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,240
So when I hover here you can see we have opened this WPF repository.

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,180
Here you can see the solutions from that repository.

74
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,270
You can double-click a solution to open it.

75
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,210
But let's go back to the Connections page and let's open up again

76
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,240
the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository.

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,180
Let's double-click the solution to open this solution.

78
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,230
Now let's go again to the Connections page.

79
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,200
Now you see here we have two repositories.

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,250
When you right-click a repository that is not opened in Team Explorer,

81
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,180
you have here the option to remove it from this view.

82
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,240
Instead of using the context menu, you can also just press the Delete key.

83
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,190
This just removes the repository from this view.

84
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,250
It doesn't delete the repository from your machine.

85
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,260
If you have existing local Git repositories that don't show up here,

86
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,180
you can add them by clicking here on Add.

87
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,220
Then you just specify the path to that repository.

88
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,240
So I could click here on the three dots to select a path to a repository.

89
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,995
Or you can also enter a parent folder and Visual Studio

90
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:25,260
scans all the sub-folders for repositories.

91
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,180
So let's just keep here D:\Julia and let's click Add,

92
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,330
and you can see Visual Studio finds again the WPF

93
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,180
repository that is in the WPF sub-folder.

94
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,598
But now,

95
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:40,240
let me remove this repository from this view as we want to focus on

96
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,220
the WiredBrainCoffee.ShopInfoTool repository.

97
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,554
Alright,

98
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:47,990
now you saw how to clone a repository directly from

99
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:59,000
the start window of Visual Studio, and also by using Team Explorer. Let's wrap up now what you have learned in this module.
