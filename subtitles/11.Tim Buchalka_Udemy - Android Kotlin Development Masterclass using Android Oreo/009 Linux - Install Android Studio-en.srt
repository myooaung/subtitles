1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,390
In this video, I'm gonna show you how to

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,340
download and install Android studio

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,260
which is the program we're going to be

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,210
using to write our Android applications

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,250
in this course. Now just a reminder

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,710
though that this is the Linux video,

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,090
so if you're running a Windows machine or a

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,279
Mac there is a separate video you can

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,869
follow along with in this section of the

10
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:25,510
course for those operating systems but

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,650
if you're using Linux you're in the

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,109
right place, so let's get started.

13
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,580
Now it's possible that you might be running

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,640
a 32-bit version of Linux if that's the

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,500
case firstly consider installing a

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,540
64-bit version the next time you rebuild

17
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,620
your computer because there's lots of

18
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,320
advantages. Now to check whether you are

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,600
running a 32-bit we can open a terminal

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,559
session and we can type uname space

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,280
minus m, now if it reports x86

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,530
underscore 64 it does in my case that

23
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,530
means you're running a 64-bit version

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,629
but if it comes back with either a 386

25
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,449
or i6 86 then that means you're running

26
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,660
a 32-bit versions of Linux. Now Android

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,330
studio includes its own installation of

28
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,970
Java but that only ships with a 64-bit

29
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,610
version and won't work on a 32-bit

30
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,990
system, so that's why we're talking about

31
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,960
64 and 32 bit so the bottom line is if

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,470
you've got a 386 returned or i686 on

33
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,689
the screen by following that uname

34
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,360
minus m command and stop the video here and

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,390
watch the next video, that next video

36
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,040
will show you how to install Java on

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,799
your 32-bit Linux system, once you've

38
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,600
followed the steps in that video come

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,880
back here and continue with this one and

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,380
note that this applies even if you

41
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,020
intend programming in Kotlin. Kotlin uses

42
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,630
the Java Virtual Machine or JVM so you

43
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,909
still need to have a working JDK Java

44
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,460
development kit installed on your 32-bit

45
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,649
system to be able to do that. Now if

46
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,299
you're running a 64-bit version of

47
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,939
Ubuntu or one of its derivatives then

48
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,649
you need to install some 32-bit

49
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,810
libraries first and if you just go

50
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,210
quickly to Google's instructions on

51
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,189
their page and we're going to paste the

52
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,719
link in and this link is available in

53
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,429
the resources section of this video if

54
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,780
you need it you can see if

55
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,540
developer.android.com slash studio slash

56
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,050
install.html, once we get there we

57
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,610
need to select Linux

58
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,640
and by the instructions because we've

59
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,170
got instructions for three platforms or

60
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,320
select Linux and you can see there's a

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,390
commands there for 64-bit machines to

62
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,490
get Android studio to work now what goes

63
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,720
through what these are for but the

64
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,700
bottom line is that we need to install

65
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,250
all five to get Android studio working

66
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,560
to get emulators working and to avoid an

67
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,710
error that can pop up and with Ubuntu

68
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,770
versions right up to and including 16.04

69
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,020
all these packages have moved into multi

70
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,630
arch and it's likely that up that other

71
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,030
distros will do the same so what I'm

72
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,680
going to suggest is you to try these

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,270
commands first the ones I'm about to

74
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,220
show you but if you get an error with

75
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,620
any library use a corresponding command

76
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,810
that I'm going to show in a slide after

77
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,459
these commands, this will make the sense

78
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,770
as we go through. We're gonna open a

79
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,270
command window again we'll go back to

80
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,280
our command window and what we want to

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,250
do is start issuing some commands and

82
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,740
cause i'm on ubuntu 16.04 LTS, I'm going

83
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,270
to type sudo space apt to get apt - get

84
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,230
space update

85
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:27,519
I can type in my password then I'm going

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,400
to type pseudo space apt - get space

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,430
install space libc6:i386

88
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,300
we're going to go through and install

89
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,530
some of these and press enter to accept

90
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,840
the default of yes and we're going to go

91
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,110
through and do for other libraries as

92
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,080
well up arrow and we're going to delete

93
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,880
the one out the next one we want to do

94
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,930
is lib in cursors 5 : 5386 again you

95
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,070
should be checking to see with any of

96
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,170
these commands don't work if they don't

97
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,670
work we'll need to do an alternative

98
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,380
command and I'll show you a slide for

99
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,090
that once we've finished you can see

100
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,130
these both work so far our power our

101
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,390
pyro we've got three more to do so Lib

102
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:18,310
std c++ 6:3 8 6 press enter

103
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,930
this one takes a little bit longer so

104
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,449
we'll wait for that to finish

105
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:25,580
Alright, put that one up a little bit

106
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,680
two more to do now, so the next one is

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:40,310
lib z1:i386 and the last one lib

108
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:49,789
bz2-1.0:i386, I'll let that

109
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,249
one finish off as well. Alright so that's

110
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,020
all of they're all done there now

111
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,539
multi arch supports running 32-bit

112
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,479
programs on 64-bit systems so the 32

113
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,580
doesn't appear in those names so

114
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,919
Google's pages still showing lib 32 z1

115
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,870
now if you get an error for any of these

116
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,580
as I mentioned you need to use the

117
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,500
corresponding command I'm about to show

118
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,150
you to install just the packages that

119
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,159
error and the slide shows the

120
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,839
alternative commands but remember that

121
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,210
you only need to use these commands for

122
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,400
any that failed with the other commands

123
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,139
in my case I didn't get any that file so

124
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,180
I don't need to do any of these, well so

125
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,560
here's as long as you can see and that's

126
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,930
just the alternate and naming for those

127
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,150
files if for some reason you've got some

128
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,180
problems with them. Okay, so now that

129
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,770
we've got the required libraries we can

130
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,020
install Android studio let's go back to

131
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,210
the Android studio site so moany at

132
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,370
developer.android.com slash studio

133
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,199
special store I'm just going to delete

134
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,509
the install part just go to the main

135
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,789
page for Android studio and that should

136
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:52,339
allow us automatically to select or

137
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,779
should automatically select for us

138
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,099
Android studio and it should be the

139
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,659
Linux version so I'm going to select

140
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:59,120
download for that but if by chance it's

141
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,529
using it's not showing of a Linux

142
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,719
version make sure you select that and

143
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,189
I'm gonna click on I agree to the terms

144
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,389
and conditions and I'm going to download

145
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:07,580
android studio because that's a

146
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,899
relatively large file we're going to let

147
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,729
that download first and what I'm going

148
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,009
to do is click on save a little game

149
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,560
save it into our downloads folder now

150
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,899
one thing to be aware of this is

151
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,120
downloading is that the new version of

152
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,939
Android studio version 3.0 is very

153
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,379
different to the previous versions and

154
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,729
has a number of new features that

155
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,229
weren't available in that earlier

156
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,389
version or earlier versions things like

157
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,039
the layout designer for example are now

158
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,050
very different so you'll need to be

159
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,080
using Android studio 3.0 or higher for

160
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,690
this course.

161
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,640
Now if you've got an older version saved

162
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,500
version to version 2.3

163
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,540
you still need to install the 3.0

164
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,810
version for this course into a studio 2

165
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,020
and 2.3 will update itself to version 3,

166
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,700
so make sure you accept the update when

167
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,920
it's offered in that version if you are

168
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,300
using a previous version of Android

169
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,130
studio. Alright so I'm just gonna let

170
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,630
this finish it's just about to finish

171
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,770
downloading and then we're going to

172
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,500
begin, ok that's finished as you can see

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,990
so I'm going to close down the web

174
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,730
browser and I'm going to just open a

175
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,120
browser, a explorer window and I'm going

176
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,610
to go to my downloads folder because

177
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,600
that's where it was so you're going to

178
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,480
go to whichever folder you were

179
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,800
downloaded this hat or wherever I went

180
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,570
my case I went to my downloads folder

181
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,220
and I'm going to extract this by opening

182
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,800
it and once just to actually put this

183
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,360
somewhere so I'm going to just put this

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,360
in my home folder so I'm gonna click on

185
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,320
the Android studio right click extract

186
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,060
and I'm gonna come up here to home so

187
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,040
I'll depth that is installed in the home

188
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,440
location but you can actually install

189
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,120
that wherever you like but in my case

190
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,280
that makes sense to install to extract

191
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,630
it to there so let's go ahead and do it

192
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,850
let that finish

193
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,920
and by the way obviously you've probably

194
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,010
figured out now this is the ubuntus

195
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,870
installation instructions if you do have

196
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,390
another linux distro check

197
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,000
out the the installation page for

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,020
android studio that i've showed

199
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,610
previously because it's also got

200
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,440
instructions up for example for a 60 bit

201
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,350
64 bit fedoras setup so some options if

202
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,790
you need t. Alright so we finished

203
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,980
with our card manager we can close it

204
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,410
now, close down now the launcher

205
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,570
the file manager and we wouldn't go

206
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,820
now into the folder where we extracted

207
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,620
those files so I'm going to go in my

208
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,330
case and I have a look I'm should be in

209
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,730
my home location which I am and if I

210
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,020
have a look at the files there I can see

211
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,730
Android studio folder is there now so I

212
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,400
can type CD space and Android and that

213
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,070
will finish the autocomplete the path

214
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,450
and I have a look in the bin subfolder

215
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,530
you can see there's a file there called

216
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,039
studio SH I'm going to run that studio

217
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,410
dot SH and that's going to start the

218
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,630
installation process now what I'm going

219
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,490
to do is continue on and get this going

220
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,570
and I'm going to talk a little bit about

221
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,280
ibus if you happen to get a problem

222
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,350
with our bus then at this case because

223
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,520
it's a new installation we haven't got

224
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,070
any import any settings to import if you

225
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,270
have kind of old version of Android

226
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,010
studio you can use custom location to

227
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,780
grab your settings if you wish, give

228
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,790
android studio a moment to start

229
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,649
you can see it's finding the various SDK

230
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:14,760
which is software development kit

231
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,010
components that it needs because it'll

232
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,959
need to do that download in addition you

233
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
can see I clicked on next select

234
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,670
standard next you've got a choice of

235
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,800
themes here you can choose IntelliJ dark

236
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,680
color or gtk+ and that relates to how

237
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,830
the look and feel of Android studio oh

238
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,020
it's different now this one here with

239
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,220
the white background is great for

240
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,600
recording video so I'm going to do that

241
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,180
but dark the dark background is often

242
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,380
good on the eyes so you may want to

243
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,060
consider that in my case I'm going to

244
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,300
leave it on IntelliJ click on next I'm

245
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,770
at the stage now where you can see that

246
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,010
it's verifying settings and when you

247
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,300
need to get all this stuff installed

248
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,740
because Android studio is just the first

249
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,810
component we need to load download this

250
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,240
SDK on a software development kit which

251
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,680
is got all the stuff that helps us be

252
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,480
able to correct in Android applications

253
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,850
so I'm gonna click on next to that now

254
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,560
if you're using a bunt which I am or a

255
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
distro based on it then you should

256
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,970
already have KVM installed and this this

257
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,589
particular screen comes up if your

258
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:11,970
computer supports hardware

259
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,130
virtualization now if you're not sure

260
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,779
whether you have got it installed or

261
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,640
let's say you can actually click on this

262
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,010
link here - and perhaps book market

263
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,600
which could be a good idea if you need

264
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,670
to review the instructions later and

265
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,110
there's also a video later in this

266
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,810
section or making sure that VTX is

267
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,690
enabled in your computer's bios now

268
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,579
although this is used for intel hexam's

269
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,740
hardware accelerator which isn't needed

270
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,220
on linux kvam also uses VTX so it's a

271
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,260
good what's actually required to make

272
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,670
sure that that's enabled so if you're

273
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,020
running into issues later on with

274
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,079
emulators refer to that video there are

275
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,170
ad processors use a process called amd-v

276
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,200
an AMD v can't be disabled in the bios

277
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,670
so the bottom line there is you've got

278
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,560
an AMD processor this shouldn't be

279
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,660
anything more you need to do and i'm

280
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,800
going to show you in either case how to

281
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,600
check your virtualization is enabled at

282
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,310
the end of this video but now that what

283
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,170
we're going to do is click on finish so

284
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,450
we can leave that downloading and the

285
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,709
other thing i wanted to talk about very

286
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,510
briefly and i'm just going to get this

287
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,920
terminal window while that's downloading

288
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,230
going actually what we'll do is well

289
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,590
open another terminal window

290
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,390
over here, we'll just put that over the

291
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,710
top there to hide that one for now

292
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,140
now while Android studio was installing

293
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,910
you might have got an error appearing to

294
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,920
do with input problems with IBUs prior

295
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,780
to one point five point one one if you

296
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,920
didn't have any errors then you don't

297
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,330
need to follow this particular part of

298
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,400
the video you know the older version of

299
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,670
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS uses an older version

300
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,620
of ibus version one point five point

301
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,570
five but it's actually very rare to get

302
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,790
any problems the bottom line here is if

303
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,410
you find that the keyboard stops working

304
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,180
in the Android studio you may have to

305
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,580
restart and you should be okay if you

306
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,870
want to check your version of our bus

307
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,880
just add a new terminal window like I've

308
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,380
now then you can type in AI bus version

309
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,790
you see in my case I'm adding a bus one

310
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,190
point five point one one so basically

311
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,680
the input problem shouldn't exist if

312
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,240
you're running this version or higher,

313
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,040
in my case I am so I haven't got any errors

314
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,080
so just keeping in mind that you can

315
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,000
safely ignore the I bus warning in many

316
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,730
cases if it does come up don't click the

317
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,260
do not show again link if you do get

318
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,700
that warning in case you want to follow

319
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,310
up that link in the future you can hover

320
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,110
over it and click on the X icon at the

321
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,400
top to dismiss it for now and you can

322
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,870
always click on the do not show again in

323
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,790
the future if it gets too annoying but

324
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,780
again that's only if you're getting

325
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,250
problems you can see in my case I didn't

326
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,110
get those problems I'm going to close

327
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,280
down that terminal window all right so

328
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,780
you can see now that over to the right

329
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,060
told us that the Android SDK is up to

330
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,310
date and over here Android studio has

331
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,690
actually finished the process of

332
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,950
downloading the software development kit

333
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,640
so I can click on finish there and you

334
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,160
can see we're now running Android studio

335
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,660
and by the way during that installation

336
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,730
process if you do get a dialog asking

337
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,650
you to retry at some point just click

338
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,450
retry because sometimes the downloading

339
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,980
of some components fails for no apparent

340
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,290
reason perhaps around busy network and

341
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,570
then take Google's end and retrying it

342
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,190
should fix it in most cases and perhaps

343
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,630
sometimes you may even need to retry

344
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,380
more than once

345
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,880
certainly there has been an issue in the

346
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,590
past but obviously with my installation

347
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,510
I didn't have any problems today.

348
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,620
Alright now once the installation is

349
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,150
finished it's a good idea to set up a

350
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,220
desktop launcher so that you don't have

351
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,660
to keep running Android studio from the

352
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,910
terminal so to do this you just come

353
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,820
down here to configure and click on

354
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,030
create desktop entry and

355
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,640
I can click on ok you can optionally set

356
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,200
it up so the entry is applicable for all

357
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,060
users on this machine I'm just going to

358
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,640
click on ok to adjust this user and you

359
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,200
can see the Android studio icon appear

360
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,110
to the left there ok and we can now exit

361
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,740
Android studio then we can come back up

362
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,530
to here and we can type it into a studio

363
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,150
or I could have clicked on the like

364
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,710
there and I can click on the enter to do

365
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,540
and I can start it that way now without

366
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,270
using the command line. Alright so

367
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,240
that's Android studio installed now we

368
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,010
need there is a video coming up where we

369
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,300
need to actually configure the Safa

370
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,590
development kit and you'll see that also

371
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,930
in this section of this course but - one

372
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,250
other thing I promised to do was just

373
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,250
talk about this was just showing you how

374
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,810
to quickly check to see if hardware

375
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,210
virtualization supported so we're back

376
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,370
on this terminal session again and we

377
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,740
can type in KVM - ok now this case I've

378
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,910
actually got an error as you can see

379
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,290
here if you get that error it's telling

380
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,970
you how to fix it we need to install the

381
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,550
CPU checker so type in sudo space apt

382
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:35,800
space install space CPU - chicken well

383
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,220
then install and once we do that we

384
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,020
should be able to check and we can the

385
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,280
command to type K again KVM - ok you can

386
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,540
see here that we've actually got an

387
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,400
error I've got an error because I'm

388
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,190
running Linux and a Mac operating system

389
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,290
it's a virtual machine but you hopefully

390
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,850
will see an error message similar to

391
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,370
this on the screen and you can see on

392
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,050
the screen there it actually says k vm

393
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,310
acceleration can now be used

394
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,830
Dheeraj KVM exists so more than likely

395
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,320
that you'll actually get that on most

396
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,430
Linux installations and alternate to

397
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,750
that commands you're going to do a cat

398
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,360
space /proc /cp you info space of coal

399
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,090
or pipe rather space eat grep space

400
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,900
minus c double quotes vm x then the pipe

401
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,470
character again SVM that's an alternate

402
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,690
come on there if you're going to know

403
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,700
about other than 0 then hardware

404
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,410
virtualization is ok yeah I've got a 0

405
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,690
here again because I'm running Linux as

406
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,450
a virtual machine on Mac platform this

407
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,650
is what you should see something like

408
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,800
this you can see in that example there we've got

409
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,300
for showing which means that Harvard

410
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,510
virtualization is okay for that machine.

411
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,410
Alright now if you're not running a

412
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,570
virtual machine already like I am search

413
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,339
I'd like to see if your Intel processor

414
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:54,190
supports VTX and if it does watch the

415
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,810
later video in this section of the

416
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,910
course to enable that in your BIOS and

417
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,399
if you've got an AMD processor then that

418
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,800
doesn't apply if your AMD processor

419
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
doesn't support virtualization and the

420
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,890
previous commands would report of that

421
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,600
and there's nothing you can do in the

422
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,279
BIOS to enable it from it for an AMD

423
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,740
platform. Alright so in the next video

424
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,370
we're going to look at configuring

425
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,860
Android studio and the steps from now on

426
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,690
are largely the same regardless of which

427
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,610
operating system you're using so I'll

428
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,140
see you in the video titled configure

429
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,930
Android SDK on all three platforms and

430
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,430
by the way skip over the next video

431
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,899
because that was relating to installing

432
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,390
the Java development kit on a 32-bit

433
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,519
version of Linux which doesn't apply now

434
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,170
because you've either done that already

435
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,750
or won't need it, so go to the video

436
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,610
titled configure Android SDK on all

437
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,110
three platforms in this section of the

438
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,490
course and I'll see you in that video.
