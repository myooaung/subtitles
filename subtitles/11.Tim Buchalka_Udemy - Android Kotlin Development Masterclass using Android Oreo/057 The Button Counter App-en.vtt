00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.840

In this video we come to create an app that does more than just displaying widgets on the screen will



2

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.370

stop by producing some code so that we can get the button to actually do something that will extend



3

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.840

the app to see how to include a menu.



4

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.930

Now in future sections I'm going to show you the finished app running first.



5

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.340

So you know what it is we're creating but I'm not going to do that here partly because the app is very



6

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.820

simple and partly because we kind of change what it does halfway through to start with kind of a challenge



7

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.310

to build that layout for the user interface that the poor use started to help with that he has some



8

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.490

rules governing how you can use constraints so that she can say the rules are pretty simple.



9

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.490

Each viewer must have at least two constraints one horizontal and vertical.



10

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.200

You can create constraints only between a constraint handle and an anchor point that share the same



11

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.050

plane.



12

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.590

So in other words a vertical plane the left and right sides of a view can be constrained only to another



13

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.960

vertical plane and baselines can constrain only two other baselines.



14

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.690

For example you can constrain the top of one which is to the left of another.



15

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.990

Now each constraint though can be used with just one constraint but you can create multiple constraints



16

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.210

from different widgets to the same anchor point.



17

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.210

Now if you don't constrain a widget both vertically and horizontally Antwoord won't know where to place



18

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.990

it on the screen which it's not constrained horizontally.



19

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.090

Move to the left of the screen and which is then aren't constrained vertically will move to the top.



20

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.250

They are constrained on a vertical edge can only be connected to another vertical edge.



21

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.800

So in other words you can't constrain the top of one widget to the left side of another.



22

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.280

And it's not really difficult to remember as it's a bit of this new age constraint handle can only be



23

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.420

connected to one anchor point and anchor point by the way is a constraint.



24

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.490

Hand-to that's the destination of a constraint or an edge to the screen.



25

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.950

There are anchor points can have more than one constraint going to the night.



26

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.620

Again that's easy to remember.



27

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.120

You can constrain multiple widgets to the edges of the screen for example.



28

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.000

All right so let's go ahead and create the project we're going to be using here.



29

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.750

What kind of quick start in your intro project.



30

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.430

We're going to call this one button click.



31

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.360

Company name is going to be you learn programming down Academy and going to make sure that we're included



32

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.990

to Scotland support by ensuring that the checkbox is checked to the left so that that's if you're using



33

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.660

this during this happened the Cottman course.



34

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.350

But if you're building this in the job of course you want to make sure that include Kotla support is



35

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.090

actually unchecked.



36

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.280

So I click on next.



37

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.350

Now on this crane we're going to make sure that the minimum STK is API 17 and everything else is unchecked.



38

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.770

I can say here that I've got IPY 17 selected which is Android 4.0 and everything else is unchecked.



39

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.680

Click on next we want to start off with an empty activity so choose that or the closest one to that



40

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.330

things have changed and click on next.



41

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.910

Now the suggested names here for the activity and lay out a fine.



42

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.930

So make sure that the two options here the two checkboxes for generate last follow and backwards compatibility



43

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:22.100

app Capet make sure that they're both checked as well and click on finish there once the credibility



44

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.750

is finished and the indexing is complete.



45

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.770

We can actually continue



46

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.040

see the credibility's running down the bottom so just give them a moment to complete OK and then it's



47

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.170

all done.



48

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.210

So what's the grade.



49

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.670

What has finished is it has now we can open up the rest lap photos are going to come out of here.



50

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.750

If your purchase paints not showing for some reason or perhaps you've got a screen that looks like this



51

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.330

on the project page to the left they want to make sure that you are and will be selecting Android If



52

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.510

it's not selected.



53

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.600

They want to expand app and expand raise and expand out.



54

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.820

We want to double click this activity and small minded X-amount to make sure that that's on the screen.



55

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.990

And if it was already existing up here just double click it and then I'm going to click on this project



56

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.080

and he declares that up to give us a bit more spice.



57

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.430

All right.



58

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.900

Now time for the challenge.



59

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.630

So the challenge is to create a layout containing a plain text widget a button and a text you and arrange



60

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.290

them so that they look like the image you can see on screen.



61

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.840

Now it's a screen size all the orientation changes the plain text and Button widgets must remain at



62

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.940

the top of the screen with a button over to the right and the plain text filling the space from the



63

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.310

left edge up to the button.



64

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.910

Now the text you should start just below the plain text and should expand to use as much as the screen



65

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.440

it needs when the text in it grows.



66

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.220

It should also be scrollable vertically as it gets bigger than the available space on the screen.



67

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.340

No margin set those to 16 to pay.



68

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.840

And as this is the first real challenge and the costs have included images of the design and blueprint



69

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.810

as you can see on the screen now now take a good look at eyes and then pause this video and see if you



70

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.730

can go ahead and create that interface and start the video when you're ready to come back and say may



71

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.880

go with the solution.



72

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.990

I posed the video now.



73

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.480

All right.



74

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.150

You managed to get that working what to get a large component of it working anyway.



75

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.690

So the first thing we want to do now to build this interface is you're going to titillate the hello



76

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.820

world which it was created for us.



77

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.180

So let's start by doing that sort of click on Hollowell and click that in the design or the blueprint.



78

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.780

Delete that.



79

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.400

I'm going to press that.



80

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.030

OK.



81

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.530

All right.



82

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.470

So up till date it's a hollow word widget that was created for us.



83

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.370

Now we're going to drag the three widgets we want onto the design and place them roughly where we want



84

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.380

them using the card lines that appear as well as a god.



85

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.300

The other Courtland's happy when you've dragged to Wichita recognize position such as 16 DP away from



86

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.580

the edge of a lamp.



87

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.780

So by moving the button around a bit before dropping it you can actually get both horizontal and vertical



88

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.230

gardens to appear and you'll see that shortly.



89

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.190

Now if they don't appear It doesn't matter as to time really any takes seconds to fix up the mat.



90

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.130

The margins up manually anyway.



91

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.630

So I'm going to stop making sure that what I connect is a I boot and you can see here that we haven't



92

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.300

got a slash through the auto connect.



93

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.580

So that's enabled.



94

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.520

And the other thing I'm going to do is make sure the default margins sit to 16 do pay someone to come



95

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.040

over here because it said tonight I'm going to click on 68 or I could have talked that and now good



96

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.840

to go.



97

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.880

So next we're going to drop a button over to the right.



98

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.070

Now we could drop the plain text which at first the order that you placed to which is the reason is



99

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.490

really important here.



100

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.720

But we want the button to be constrained to the top and right edges of the layout.



101

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.090

So I'm going to make sure that it's correct and then create any constraints that aren't done automatically



102

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.830

and then we'll also check the top and right margins.



103

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.770

So I've got all under here and on the pallet come over here and just drag it over to the right hand



104

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:05.340

side making sure that both card lines that we've got in the horizontal and vertical cards release it



105

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.000

because we've got what I connect turned on.



106

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.820

You can see it's automatically added a constraint at the top and right edge which is what we want here.



107

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.720

And also we can say that to our margins 16 DP for the top and 16 DP for the right by fear.



108

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:26.840

If they're not correct for some reason you can just click on the dropdown and change the number as appropriate.



109

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.730

And of course you can add a constraint manually if for some reason it wasn't added for you.



110

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.410

All right so that's the button next we want the plain text widget and that's either here in the text



111

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.720

category.



112

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.550

Now the plain text which it is going to be placed on the left hand side.



113

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:49.530

And again if I stop this and drag it around you can see if I'm moving it slowly you can get I got loans



114

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.320

to pay for a sort of medically.



115

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.250

So want so relace we should fund the lift and the top constraints get added automatically and we can



116

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.970

say that that's the case over here.



117

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:04.390

And I'm just checking to see that 16 day pay for the top margin and 16 to pay for the right margin.



118

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:10.950

Now we also want this constraint to the left of the button and more than Laclede that hasn't been added



119

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.610

automatically.



120

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.070

And it wasn't added FNET.



121

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.400

So I'm going to add the right hand constraint to the left of the button manually.



122

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:22.740

So I'm just going to come over here and drag that over to the button so that plain text widget is not



123

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.630

constrained to the button.



124

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.270

Now I connect my also have added a bottom constraint to the bottom of the button.



125

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.120

That's not a problem in that way but it could be in others.



126

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:37.770

So if you are seeing a constraint from the bottom of the button down to the bottom of the screen remove



127

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.360

that if one was created.



128

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.080

Right now at the moment the plane takes which it isn't set up to fill all the available space left or



129

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.800

right.



130

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.250

So we want to change that we didn't expect to match constraint.



131

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:56.280

When I click on that to make sure it is selected and we're going to change the layout width to match



132

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.420

constraint and you can say that's going to fit all the available space.



133

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.740

So in other words we're allowing it to fill the space from the left of the screen up to the button.



134

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:12.330

Now to allow to fill the screen vertically you also change the lad height to match constraint.



135

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:19.530

If you're trying to do that something weird happens as you can see there and the the which it shrinks



136

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.400

vertically to just a law.



137

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.430

The reason that happens is because there's no Boerum constraint so there's nothing to define its bounds



138

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.900

vertically.



139

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:33.030

Now if you're going to use much constraint in which it has to be constrained on both edges top and bottom



140

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.570

in this case so a better option here would be to leave the white set to wrap around the school content.



141

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:44.090

And that's because it allows the widget to expand vertically to supply all the text it contains.



142

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.180

So we're going to go ahead and do that.



143

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.910

Change that to get content that fixes that up.



144

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.460

And the other thing to check is to make sure that the margins are set correctly.



145

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.310

And sometimes you find there's a little bit of a weird bug that



146

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.700

you can say that that's showing as 16 patrons at twice you can say it briefly moves over and briefly



147

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.540

moves back again.



148

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.590

This is the left margin I'm talking about.



149

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.300

So the plain text.



150

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.540

Now we want the text to start from the left hand side but the widget is automatically set to centered



151

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.180

there as more text is entered.



152

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.210

Expand right.



153

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.790

But it should start from the left edge of the layout.



154

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.070

So to do that we want to change the horizontal slaughter to zero.



155

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.680

So thats hard.



156

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.180

That's a really hard fast and to the left are going to change that slot to zero.



157

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.130

Now you may or may not get a problem when you do that.



158

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.080

If you read a text which it has a lift margin showing in the design or blueprint then everything is



159

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.420

falling.



160

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.810

But theres a bug in Android studio that has been for a while even back in version two point three stable



161

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.580

release.



162

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:56.220

So it is Tymms to cater for right to left languages and uses the Let us go margin's stopped and laughed



163

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.170

on the margin and attributes.



164

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:05.180

Now that might be instead of or in addition to the lion school margin left and lay on the margin right.



165

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.710

Chibi-Usa So the exact effect of the changes with different versions.



166

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.610

So its not really yet easy to demonstrate exactly what happened on your screen but hopefully everything



167

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.760

works fine in the backspin fix by the time you watch this video.



168

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.480

But to show you why one why the public messes with the preview.



169

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.470

Going to make a change to the margins for the text widget so I'm going to be here for the edit takes



170

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.730

were just plain text.



171

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:36.180

I'm going to take a hit to get to the extended at the beats and I'm going to expand the land on a small



172

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.490

margin here.



173

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.450

And what I'm going to do do is delete the settings if there's anything in there for the rot and I'm



174

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.990

going to sit in to 16 pay which is currently set at the moment.



175

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.490

Now it may already be using Endace it was in this case here in which case there's nothing obviously



176

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:57.380

that you need to change but I can see that the net effect of that is that the text is showing hard either



177

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.820

against the left hand edge with no margins showing.



178

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:08.250

And that's been the case all along since of first dragged this plain text into a text widget onto the



179

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.190

screen.



180

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:15.480

Now I'm not exactly sure why it's the left margin that's vanished when it was sitting for the right



181

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.420

margin that was changed or in this case has been sent.



182

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.500

But it's a bug.



183

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.690

And that's the nature of bugs seems worse if you have different peers specifying the left or right margins



184

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.180

for example using lift.



185

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.180

And he can say he has got left and right specified or Staffa right.



186

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:35.670

So you will get strange results with margins if you don't check the margins in the attributes section



187

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.110

as you can see.



188

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.110

Now the left margin.



189

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:45.600

Start and End that repeats without bias introduced in API 17 jelly bean and will actually be ignored



190

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.010

on earlier Android versions.



191

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:53.670

Now what that means is the margin what he said on earlier versions unless you've got lay out on the



192

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.980

school margin left and left on school margin right attributes.



193

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:04.480

Now you can use them as well as the staff inversions the new attributes are ignored on older versions.



194

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:09.660

So once you've actually got your margins correct checked the lat margin attributes and make sure you've



195

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.120

got both sets of attributes for each margin.



196

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.850

So if you set left then you also want to start to the same value.



197

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.250

If you set right then set into the same value.



198

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.350

Now we're targeting April 17 and above.



199

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.480

So you might think you could just use the start and end attributes.



200

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.300

That's correct.



201

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:34.410

You can but if you let it change your mind and target IP 16 or above you have to go through every lad



202

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.500

in the app setting the left or right margin attributes.



203

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:45.350

But every widget now Android studio may hopefully start doing full doing that for us in a future release.



204

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:50.340

But right now it's much more reliable to just skip parts pairs of actually butes when you're creating



205

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.430

the last just click on the button to selected a city.



206

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.350

Imagine if it's not already set to 16 DP as well.



207

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:04.570

And I'm going to sit in my case because Rock wasn't specified I'm going to specify right to be 16 tapes.



208

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:11.100

Well I don't know if I click on start and change that to 16 DP as well so that both match and he can



209

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.990

say that I've done that.



210

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:19.950

We've got lift tape 16 pay start 16 DP and 16 D playing right 16 d pay you can say that time when to



211

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:26.290

set that we've neo-GOP the margin correctly showing in the design and blueprint.



212

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.900

So that's good and that makes everything work out OK.



213

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:33.950

But what Chad if you change the margins in the inspector and check the margins again like I'm showing



214

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.750

you if you do.



215

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.930

All right so the text few.



216

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.050

Well it's going to go directly below the plain text widget.



217

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:45.640

What we'll do is we'll finish the video here and move stuff up in the next video.



218

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.470

Well we'll go ahead and add that textfield.



219

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.040

So I see you in the next video.
