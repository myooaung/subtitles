00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.800

Alright so let's now continue working with the layouts, starting with the search activity.



2

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.330

So what we want to do is right click the package name under the java folder, so the subfolder package,



3

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.670

and we're going to get the Android wizard to do most of the work for us. So I'm going to click on, right click



4

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.030

New, select Activity,



5

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.660

and we're going to choose basic activity.



6

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.770

And if you can't remember which activities which, then you can go through the gallery instead, as I've shown you in



7

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.790

earlier sections of this course. But again to do that we can right click over here again, select New, this time



8

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.810

instead of choosing activity,



9

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.810

we're going to actually choose Gallery instead, under activity, and there's the gallery with the pictures of what we'll be



10

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.250

getting from each template.



11

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.340

Now in this particular case we want basic activity, because we want a toolbar, so click on that, and click on



12

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.320

next. So we're now in exactly the same place we were, when I cancelled the first wizard,



13

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.130

so it doesn't really matter which option you choose to get here.



14

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.160

Now the activity name is going to be search activity, and there's only one other thing other than typing that in



15

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.990

which I'll do first.



16

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.230

So only one other thing we need to do on this screen, and that's because Android automatically handles going



17

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.540

back to what it knows as the parent activity, when you click the up button on the toolbar.



18

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.960

But to do that, it has to know what the parent activity is.



19

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.380

So we tell it to do that by adding an entry in the manifest, or to the manifest.



20

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.690

However the wizard can do this for us if we enter an activity in the hierarchical parent box here,



21

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.610

and that may be off the screen or in my case not showing correctly because I've enlarged the fonts for video



22

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.500

presentation, but you may need to scroll down to see it on your version of Android Studio.



23

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.240

Now you can't select the parent activity using the dropdown though,



24

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.450

unfortunately. It probably should work but hasn't been working in the last few versions of Android Studio.



25

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.940

Now we can use the ellipsis button at the end to choose main activity from the list.



26

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.290

So if nothing appears in the list after a couple of seconds, close the window and click on the ellipsis button



27

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.630

again. You can see that took a few seconds before it actually appeared in my case.



28

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.540

We'll have a look at the manifest later to see what it's just done,



29

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.850

but for now we're going to select that and click OK.



30

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.550

And although you can't see it very well it is actually main activity as the hierarchical parent on the



31

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.450

screen now.



32

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.140

Now the final dropdown, if I scroll down a little bit more to see that, is source language. This lets you choose Kotlin



33

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.910

support,



34

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.130

so choose Java if you want Java code, and use it to select Kotlin



35

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.710

if you want Kotlin code.



36

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.460

So if everything else is fine at this point you can click on finish.



37

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.230

Now what's happened now is it's created two additional source files for us.



38

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.030

We've got activity underscore search dot XML, this one here, and also content underscore search dot



39

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.990

XML.



40

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.320

We're just waiting for the spiel to actually finish.



41

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.180

Now we're not going to add anything to this layout.



42

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.600

It's just going to have a toolbar for the search function.



43

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.510

Now we don't really need content underscore search as there isn't any content, and for that reason I'm



44

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.100

going to go ahead and delete that.



45

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.170

So coming over here to content underscore search dot XML.



46

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.520

But before I delete it, it is being included in activity underscore search, so it's best to open up activity



47

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.970

underscore search first, which is already open for me.



48

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.770

And I'll just close down the project pane to make a bit more space, and come over here to the component tree,



49

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.660

and you can see it's included over here.



50

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.590

So I'm just going to select that, and delete the include entry on that line, and you can see that's now disappeared.



51

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.790

And the easiest way was how I've shown you, by selecting it in the component tree, and deleting it from there.



52

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.450

And while I'm here I'm also going to delete the floating action button because we're not going to use that



53

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.970

either.



54

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.900

It comes with this basic activity template but we only want to use the toolbar.



55

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.970

So we'll go ahead and delete the floating action button,



56

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.480

and we've still got the toolbar there as you can see. So now that I've done that, I'm going to delete the XML file from the layout



57

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.120

folder, making sure I delete the correct file.



58

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.990

So I want to to open that up again,



59

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.750

Project pane, and content underscore searche dot XML is the one we want to delete, and that's because



60

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.740

we do need the activity underscore search dot XML. So I'm deleting content search,



61

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.780

click on OK, and it's now disappeared, and we've still got our activity underscore search there with the toolbar.



62

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.440

Alright,



63

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.720

so I'll just reformat the XML for that,



64

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.250

Back to design.



65

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.030

Alright so at this point now the search layout's done, so I'm going to close down activity underscore search dot XML.



66

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.470

Now the third layout we need in this app, is for displaying the full photos when we select one from the



67

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.650

list.



68

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.610

So I'm going to create a new basic activity, just as we've done for the search activities.



69

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.900

So I'm going to right click the package name, select New, come down to activity. And this time we're going to choose basic activity, and then again there's



70

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.070

no need to go into the gallery because we've done it.



71

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.450

And even I haven't forgotten which template to use in that short time. Now the activity, let's call



72

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.080

that photo details activity.



73

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.510

This time I'm not going to set the hierarchical parent,



74

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.760

so we can see the difference later. Now I'm going to change the title to include a space,



75

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.720

and remove the word activity, so photo details in other words.



76

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.290

That's what the user will see in the toolbar so photo details will look a bit nicer. Everything else at this point



77

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.140

is fine.



78

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.900

So as long as you've got the correct language selected here, and source language, depending on whether



79

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.100

you want Kotlin or Java, you can then click on finish.



80

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.190

Alright and this time we don't need to do anything with the details file, in this case the activity underscore



81

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.680

photo underscore details,



82

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.720

because we're going to be adding our widgets to content underscore photo underscore details.



83

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.910

So I'm going to open that up in the layout designer.



84

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.890

Well in my case it's actually already open.



85

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.190

So I'm going to close down the project pane to make a bit more space.



86

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.400

Now we're going to do something a little bit different for this layout.



87

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.910

Now some of the photos will be too long to fit on the display, especially with a text that will



88

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.760

also be showing, so to cope with this,



89

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.470

we're going to use a scroll view. Now if you want to make things scrollable when they otherwise wouldn't



90

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.140

be,



91

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.950

you can drop them into a scroll view widget. Now scroll view is classified as a container, and



92

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.890

appears in a containers category. So I'm going to select that, and you can see scroll view's actually there, but we



93

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.280

won't actually add it from here though.



94

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.000

What we're going to do instead is replace the constraint layout down here in the component tree, with a scroll



95

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.890

view.



96

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.330

Now there's no need to use a layout



97

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.720

when the only thing it contains is a scroll view. Now we could drag a scroll view onto our existing



98

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.910

constraint layout,



99

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.840

but that really results in an unnecessary level of nesting.



100

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.540

And unfortunately there's currently no way to delete the constraint layout. The del key doesn't work. I'll select that and



101

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.800

try and delete it.



102

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.480

You can see nothing's happening there other than getting it de-selected.



103

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.760

So what we're going to have to do is edit the XML.



104

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.370

It's a bit more complicated but we end up with a cleaner layout in the end.



105

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:22.490

So come down here, we're going to click on the text tab. We're going to replace this android dot support



106

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.760

dot constraint dot constraint layout. We're going to replace that all with scroll view,



107

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:36.880

scroll view, like so, and you can see that Android Studio helped by actually adding it at the end so we only



108

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.410

had to type it once. And it will actually provide a list that we can select from as well,



109

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.140

if you delete it and start typing. But



110

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.970

pretty cool



111

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.650

how you notice how the closing tag changes automatically which prevents us from forgetting to change



112

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.590

it.



113

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.560

Alright so that's all we really have to do.



114

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.670

It's not really that painful, even though we had to mess with the XML a bit.



115

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.630

As long as you use the correct case for scroll view,



116

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:04.000

it'll work fine. Choosing it from a tool-tip makes life easier and less error prone.



117

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.500

Now it's probably not obvious from the demo of the app, but there's a bit of nesting of views inside



118

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.730

other views going on, to get the effects we saw.



119

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.310

Now as I start dragging widgets and layouts onto the design,



120

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.070

you might be left scratching your head and wondering what's going on.



121

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.300

But the good news is that it does make sense once you've seen the finished design.



122

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.300

Now I'll discuss it all



123

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.560

when I'm done,



124

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.830

and I'm going to be coming back to this once we've got the app working, because it's a good layout to



125

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:36.500

use for experimenting with some of the settings, to see what effect they have. Alright, so it's time to get



126

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.740

back into the designer,



127

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.810

but what we'll do is we'll work on that, and basically fleshing out this design in the next video.
