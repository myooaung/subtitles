1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,859
Alright so I digress the pit in the

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,230
previous video, we were trying to connect

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,510
the button up to some code. So now that

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,490
we've actually got references to the

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,589
widgets, let's have a go at doing that.

6
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:17,720
Now I said that the android framework

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,000
takes care of watching for user input

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,919
and notifies us when something

9
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:23,840
interesting happens you know the way it

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,149
notifies our code of events that happen

11
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:28,610
is by calling special methods that we

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,430
write called callbacks so when a button

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,170
is clicked the android framework will

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,239
call an on click method if we'd written

15
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:36,830
one and told Android that it's attached

16
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,260
to the button now we can't just go

17
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,180
creating any hold method and call it on

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,890
click and expect Kotlin to be able to

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,380
cope though Kotlin is a strongly typed

20
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,240
language which means that you have to

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,220
provide exactly the right kind of object

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,160
or method that something expects now the

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,739
way that's defined in Kotlin is using

24
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,110
interfaces and Android uses an interface

25
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,790
called onclicklistener

26
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,800
now this makes sure that only the

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,690
correct type of object is attached to

28
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,470
the button to respond to clicks and once

29
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,060
again I'm going to type the code in and

30
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,310
then explain what it's doing so first

31
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,979
thing we need to add a line on line 13

32
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,939
and we're going to type private VAR

33
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:21,889
space numtimesclicked and put equals a

34
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:24,409
zero on the end of that and when you're

35
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,600
typing on with this next bit pay careful

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,280
attention to the suggestions then

37
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,619
Android studio is popping up and you

38
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:31,819
might well find that Android studio

39
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,229
complete some more of the code for you

40
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,270
than it does for me and Google I'm

41
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,819
improving this autocomplete all the time

42
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,950
and at the moment the autocomplete for

43
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,569
Kotlin doesn't do nearly as much as it

44
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,090
does for Java but I fully expect that it

45
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,340
will as time goes by so keep an eye on

46
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,859
what's happening and also it's a good

47
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,200
idea to watch the autocomplete carefully

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,569
anyway you know just because Android

49
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:55,490
studio is suggesting something first

50
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,859
that doesn't mean that it it's what you

51
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,560
want in all situations at the moment you

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,209
probably won't know what to choose so

53
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,349
you really want to compare the options

54
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:05,149
you're getting to what appears on my

55
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,039
screen don't worry though as it all

56
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,330
starts to make sense you'll know which

57
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,580
of the options you want the first thing

58
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,560
when I come down here now below the last

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,520
line here on line 21 animator type button

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
question mark dot I'm gonna top set on

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,090
click and eventually I've got this first

62
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,470
option so I'm gonna press ENTER to that

63
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,680
one I can try that and I could do some

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,210
typing or I can also come back here

65
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,910
again double dot set on click select the

66
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,040
first option so with the parentheses

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,510
were created automatically as you can

68
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,940
see there and it's a type object space

69
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,270
colon space the the couple of you with a

70
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,780
capital B you dot on click click this

71
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,300
term I'm going to present to their next

72
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,610
we're going to type a left curly brace

73
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,910
the press ENTER and then I'm going to

74
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,910
type on the next line now override press

75
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,170
ENTER there because that's the way we

76
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,390
want fun if you end space on click and

77
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,350
you can see you've got this option that

78
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,000
has appeared on the screen there now if

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,610
I press ENTER there you can see that's

80
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,830
actually generated some code for us and

81
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,290
it's just saved a bit of typing there

82
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,190
but you're probably wondering now what

83
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,740
does all this mean well firstly I

84
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,050
started by uh this is our code on line

85
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,050
14 adding a variable called num times

86
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,120
clicked and that's there to keep track

87
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,740
of how many times we click the button

88
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,020
now I've initialized that to zero

89
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,940
because to start with the button

90
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,460
obviously hasn't been clicked now in the

91
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,640
oncreate method starting on line 24 we

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,650
call the set on click listener function

93
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,110
of our button now as the name suggests

94
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,150
this function is used to tell Android

95
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,370
what to do when the button is clicked

96
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,280
and I then created a new object of type

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,070
on listener as the argument to set on

98
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,010
click listener in fact its view dot on

99
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,800
click listener because the interface is

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,470
defined in the view class now because

101
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,840
our widgets extend view they'll all know

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,120
about this interface now we can tap

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,010
things other than buttons as you will

104
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,570
have seen using your Android phone if

105
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,850
you've got one in the past I then added

106
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,310
the unclick method to our on click

107
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,950
listener and it's this method that's

108
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,170
called when the button is clicked now

109
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,210
Android studio doesn't know what we want

110
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,250
to do to one click and that's why it's

111
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,290
out of this to do not implement it and

112
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,330
we have to replace that with our own code.

113
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,590
So let's go ahead and do that so it's going

114
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,710
to delete that line now just to do now

115
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,500
this is quite a simple method it's just

116
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,419
going to increase the number times

117
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,969
clicked variable by one and then add a

118
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,650
message to the textview widget now

119
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,509
remember that we've now got a reference

120
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,300
to the widget in the textview field so

121
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,949
we can call it's a pin method to add

122
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,050
another line of text to it so I'm going

123
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,159
to go ahead and write the code for that

124
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,270
so we're going to start by topping

125
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,330
numtimesclicked select that one then

126
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,009
type space plus equals one enter then

127
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,400
we're going to type textview question

128
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,580
mark dot append and in parentheses

129
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,360
double quotes /n I'm going to type the

130
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,110
button got tapped in space then the

131
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,800
dollar sign number times clicked space

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,639
time so again we've got a reference to

133
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,500
the text field and that's why we're able

134
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,569
to call the pin method there on line 27

135
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:38,889
and the /n that you can see here sorry

136
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,349
the backslash n I said for /n the

137
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,840
backslash n at the start of a message

138
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,330
causes a new line to be started before

139
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,479
the message is displayed that way each

140
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,029
new message starts on a new line and

141
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,770
without that the message would just

142
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,150
display one after the other

143
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,620
wrapping when they reach the end of the

144
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,409
the right edge of the textview then

145
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,849
you can use the special character

146
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:02,500
backslash n in strings whenever you want

147
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,330
to insert a line break although it's

148
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,039
more usual to put it at the end of a

149
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,830
message rather than at the beginning so

150
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,279
looking again if code on line 24 that

151
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,839
codes using that button set

152
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,029
onclicklistener method to tell the

153
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:18,339
button then we want to use our own click

154
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,319
listener when it's clicked when the

155
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,940
button is clicked it causes the unclick

156
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,069
method that we've created now it may

157
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,360
look complicated but this is the

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,849
standard pattern for attaching code to

159
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,039
an event so that your method is used

160
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,440
when the event happens now our code

161
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,000
doesn't have to worry about checking the

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,310
button the onclick method will be called

163
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,469
for us when the button is clicked and

164
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,240
that's known as event-driven programming

165
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,000
and it's used by most GUI frameworks

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,740
including Microsoft Windows

167
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,040
gnome or KDE or Linux and the Mac OS X

168
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,919
GUI aqua now in fact you wouldn't

169
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,540
normally write this code in this way

170
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,060
this is like another longhand version of

171
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,580
the code that we'd normally use once

172
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,620
again though I've done it this way just

173
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,820
so you can get to see what's really

174
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,669
happening in the next section we'll see

175
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,830
the more usual way of writing this code

176
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,419
and we're going to look at an

177
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:09,040
alternative way of setting a none click

178
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,020
listener and why you'd want to use that

179
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,630
alternative the important thing though

180
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,360
is that however the codes written what

181
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,919
we've got here is what really happens

182
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,500
when we call sound click listener we're

183
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,870
given an object as guaranteed to have an

184
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,270
on click function that Android can call

185
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,760
and remember from the Kotlin tutorial

186
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,280
section that this means the object must

187
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,870
be of a type that has the only click

188
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,330
function all must implement an interface

189
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,990
that defines the function all right so

190
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,330
with passing an object of type viewed or

191
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,040
unclick listener to the center and click

192
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,320
listener function so we have to define

193
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,990
its own click function and we do that by

194
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,460
overriding the function with the same

195
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,310
name that's defined but not implemented

196
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,950
in the interface so does it work>

197
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,050
Well let's end the video here and in the next

198
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,370
video we'll compare a bit of a test run

199
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,530
and see what happens so I'll see you in

200
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,070
the next video.
