1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:12,600
So in the previous video we saw how app will handle the situation where the user to know has permissions.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:18,410
It's not just another permission that we can request Texas again when they next try to perform the function

3
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,410
that needs the permission viewing the contact details in this case.

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,200
If the user denies the permission and takes the box saying they don't want to be asked again.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,690
Now it takes into the settings for the app so that they can test the permissions and grant the access

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,830
that I want.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,130
So we've got a good solution now.

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,360
And remember we used a snack bar to display the message to the user and also to provide them with a

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,020
link.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,990
They could tap to go ahead and grant the permission or snack bar is limited to two lines of text.

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,640
So there's not very much information you can provide to the user if you do want to give them a more

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,890
detailed explanation of why the app needs a particular permission then you might be better off using

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,510
a dialog box rather than a snack bar.

14
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,460
The principle is exactly the same though.

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,910
So let's continue with our example app and see see now how to proceed when that permission is denied.

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,810
So it needs to do one of two things.

17
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,760
When it detects that the permission hasn't been granted it either needs to request the permission or

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,940
it needs to take the user to the app's settings.

19
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,400
Now both of these tasks are simple were really seen had requested permission using the request permissions

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,580
method and launching the app settings screen is done using an intent and the start activity method that

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,400
I was saying before the tricky bit is working out which task to perform.

22
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:42,620
So how can we tell if the user had permanently not the permission but taking the box or just kept denie

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,940
in the dialog.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,630
Turns out that it isn't very difficult at all.

25
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,700
Google have thought about this and I provide a method with a catchy name.

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,530
Wait for it.

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,550
Should show request permissions rushing out.

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,770
So we get to use that in our actual code instead of just showing the text message that does at the moment.

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,920
So this coding and then will go through it and explain what it does.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,350
First I'm going to start off by changing the text that the user will click.

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,210
In other words the actual text itself.

32
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,220
So what we want to do first.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,480
Are going to change the Curdy text rather that's shown on the screen that the user will click on the

34
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,520
action text to translate to a site grant access.

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,700
Then within the car that's going to be executed when that's tapped.

36
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:36,370
It never stops a log entry locked up day to come a snack bar click starts.

37
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:45,430
That we going to add and if he knew if parentheses that activity compact dot should show or request

38
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:54,790
permission of Russian how and in parentheses this comma read on us call contex So we're going to close

39
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,630
our eyes Bryce's Then I print a copy block in the else for now I'm just going to make an empty else

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,830
I'm going to delete toast each day.

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,990
In the first if they were I'm going to do that I looked at the parentheses take them out and it's kind

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:17,960
of a snack bar click colon calling the quest permissions

43
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:28,800
this to be consistent is that what I'm going to do is copy the launch occurred here from 938 because

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,380
we're going to be executing that exact code and that's going to be posted immediately below that log

45
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,800
today.

46
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,200
And just have you can rate that and put that into the next law.

47
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:51,280
And let's also below the else put a log in there looked up day syntheses Tecoma snack bar on click things.

48
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,160
It's very clear that what's happened there.

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,760
All right so what should be done.

50
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,720
Well so me at some logging Firstly online 64 so that we can see the snack bars on a click method being

51
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:08,520
cold calling Should I request permission of rationale on line 65 and we're testing to see if it returns

52
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,320
True or false.

53
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Now I'll explain that method next.

54
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,120
But if it just returns true then we just in this case we're going to look at entry and then we're going

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,050
to call this method to request the permissions again as we've done previously.

56
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,180
So that's pretty simple.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,170
If it returns false so we're going to take the user into the settings page for the app.

58
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,300
So let's actually have a look and see what this method is all about.

59
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,830
So I'm going to just click on that bring up the documentation

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,690
now.

61
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,670
Smith It's in the compatibilities support library in the package Android support totally for our app

62
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,090
activity compact so we can use it in the car that's intended to run on Android versions before much

63
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,620
maligned.

64
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,590
Now you might be wondering why we don't just use the framework version because this method won't ever

65
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:01,100
be code if the app is running on IPR 22 earlier but the card Kampar with I try to use a framework version

66
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,180
with a minimum Mysti case less than 23.

67
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,250
Hence the reason for using the compact version just to check that what we can do is we can just take

68
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:19,460
a copy of that line temporarily copy our comment out that line and change this in the activity compact

69
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,890
and you can say you've got an error the current code requires IPR level 23 current minimum is 17.

70
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,420
Well why that's something I'd recommend you do if you want to test out something like this.

71
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,790
Placate the line of code and then go ahead and actually check it.

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,350
And he's too much original code to get back to you.

73
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,300
All right so up and that as you can see there.

74
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,190
So and what's truly I basically warned us that the card wouldn't compile unless we set them in or a

75
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,300
mistake to April 23 or higher.

76
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,180
Hence the reason that I'm using the activity compared to all the competitors in that supports versions

77
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,520
early than marshmallow.

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,810
So this method should Tusshar request permission and how

79
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,300
it's used to decide if we should show some sort of user interface to the user explaining why we need

80
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,030
the permission.

81
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,330
So the method is intended to be used as the documentation says only if you do not have the permission

82
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,570
and the context in which the permission is requested does not clearly communicate to the user what would

83
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,310
be the benefit from granting this permission.

84
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,150
So I guess that sort of implies that we shouldn't be using it because it is pretty obvious already why

85
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,430
contex app needs to access the phones contacts database.

86
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,660
It may be obvious but equally obviously if the user has denied access then we do need to prompt them

87
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,580
in some way.

88
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,510
So don't take that comment as a rule that it must be a byte no matter what.

89
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,220
Treat it as a god.

90
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:49,320
So here in case we need to do something if the app can't access the database and if that involves using

91
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,910
this very useful method so be it.

92
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,030
One thing lacking from this documentation is what the returned value signifies.

93
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,770
It just really says whether you can use to show permission or rationale you I said you get a true or

94
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,480
false.

95
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,520
But there's no real indication then of why.

96
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,430
Unfortunately you can't check the source code to find out what's going on because it eventually ends

97
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,790
up calling admitted in on the abstract package manager class an abstract methods don't have source code.

98
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,800
So the documentation we've been using that is quite informative and that's going to bring that link

99
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,200
up on the screen again.

100
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,150
That's quite informative as I said but unfortunately it's changed now.

101
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,090
It is actually a little bit less informative.

102
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,790
Have come over here we've got this content to explain why the app is permissions for click on that.

103
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,690
That actually describes the behavior you can see on the screen they know basically describes the behavior

104
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,580
of the show.

105
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,600
I should I request permission.

106
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,900
Chanel No.

107
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,460
It used to have this nice smile which I'll bring on screen but that that's now being removed that behind

108
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,480
you hasn't changed.

109
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,150
And we got over a lot of that false return value in our code.

110
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,640
Now we've looked at documentation issue with Google.

111
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,800
So the note will be back by the time you visit the site again.

112
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,300
So we've established at this point that the method will return true if the user has previously denied

113
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,600
the request which is what we want to get because we want to ask them again to grant access rather cleverly

114
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,870
it will allow false if the user has chosen to ask again option by taking the box.

115
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,450
So that means it provides a way to tell it to use as just a note to request will get true returned or

116
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,770
if I tick the box.

117
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,490
In that case we'll get false.

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,640
Now you have to be a bit careful or don't just go calling this myth all over the place because it will

119
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,640
also return false if we already have the permission and that makes sense if you think about it if the

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,800
user has granted permission then there's no point explaining to them why they need it.

121
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,670
So once you've checked and discovered that your app doesn't have the permission no dismiss it lets you

122
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,850
decide whether you can just ask again or you need to do more such as taking the case to the settings

123
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,150
or perhaps displaying a dialog with more information or what have you to do.

124
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,820
So if you're running apps for the corporate world where the app will be running on devices that are

125
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,830
centrally controlled by companies Arteta Patman then you would have to be a bit more careful.

126
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,070
That's because the should shut request permission Russian method would return false if the State Department

127
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,760
had deployed a policy preventing users from granting the permission you need.

128
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,650
So in that scenario taking them into the settings is futile.

129
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,240
But we don't cover the divorce policies in this course but it is useful just to be aware of that comment.

130
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,830
If you do end up producing corporate apps.

131
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,580
All right let's just get back to Australia.

132
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,840
So we shouldn't have cut back into this bit of code in the first place unless permission was denied.

133
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,330
And we've now checked and discovered that the commission has only been denied not permanently denied.

134
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,990
And that's why the activity compact should show request permission rationale method returning true.

135
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,340
So therefore you saw that I just posted in the same card we used earlier to request permission from

136
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,160
the user.

137
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,920
So hopefully at this point now that they've seen as neckband message when trying to display the phones

138
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,290
contacts I'll grant access.

139
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,050
So that's if it returned true.

140
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:21,160
But if the method returns false This should show either request permission or rationale that we should

141
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,430
tick the box.

142
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:27,610
So in that case we just use an intent to stop the app settings activity.

143
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,740
So let's add the card to the spot to do that.

144
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,810
It's going to be here.

145
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:38,090
So the type you want for that comment Pursley that is permanently

146
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,720
not up and she

147
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,480
takes them direct to the settings.

148
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,240
So the actual card is going we're going to start with the logs I looked up the parentheses to come up

149
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,450
and it's going to be snack bar unclick colon lauching settings

150
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,330
and begin to evolve.

151
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,350
Intent equals intent.

152
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:22,450
Capital Y in parentheses going intent not action is equal to setting's dot.

153
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:30,190
That's got to be action on the school application details and let's go to settings that are valid.

154
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:37,170
You're right is equal to your rather kept you from pots and in parentheses.

155
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:44,680
Double quotes lowercase word package comma dot package name then.

156
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,880
Now as the third argument

157
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,870
there going to attempt to use your right.

158
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,790
I mean really this starts start

159
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,570
activity in parentheses intent.

160
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,190
So I would say read like this before.

161
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:12,310
In the UK about for example we created a new intent then cold start activity to start the activities

162
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,380
scribed by the intent.

163
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:21,080
This intent is slightly different because we specified we actually need it to take the set action method

164
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,310
needs a string specifying the action to be performed.

165
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,650
And here we want to launch the settings app and have an open and applications settings now being Kotla

166
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,260
we access the action proper course rather than going by the setter.

167
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,860
And if you wanted to you could bring up the documentation for the seduction method but it really doesn't

168
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,890
say any more than what I've just mentioned.

169
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,490
Now the documentation for this constant His action on the school application and his court date was

170
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,550
kind of score's settings is a lot more informative.

171
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,580
Topping up the documentation for that.

172
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,630
So that's telling us here that it shows details about a particular application and also we have to use

173
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,880
the package schema and specify the application package name in the tents.

174
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,490
You're right now getting the applications package in them is easy.

175
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,000
We just suckhole the get package and method on a context.

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,560
Now the easiest way to get a context from inside the listener is to use this to refer to the current

177
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,980
instance of my activity.

178
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,090
Hence the use of this idea here.

179
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:24,680
Now when your y consists of a schema such as Hastey tape yes or fall or in this case package the scheme

180
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,490
is followed by an SS PE or a schema specific part.

181
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,340
In that case that's just the package.

182
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:40,610
So he obviously this first part was the name of that I talked about and now we use the Yervoy from pots

183
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,600
method to boot up the year or that we need to pass data to the intent.

184
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,780
Now we're going to be using your eyes quite a bit soon so I'm going to discuss them in more detail later

185
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,830
in the course.

186
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:57,580
For now though what I'm going to do is also take the opportunity to log your why that gets created just

187
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,280
I mean you can see what it looks like.

188
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,880
I'm going to put a log message in there.

189
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:16,270
I've got a parentheses Tecoma of course going to the snack bar Kallen spice unclick calling.

190
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,340
You are right.

191
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,490
Is the dollar on your cell phone.

192
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,210
Then we call online that's I.T. the MICKOLUS thought activity method to launch the settings Parmalat.

193
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,760
Now that should be all we need.

194
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,090
But unfortunately this code does something that we really should avoid doing.

195
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,430
And in the next I will run the app and see what that is and how it behaves.

196
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,780
I'll see you in the next video.
