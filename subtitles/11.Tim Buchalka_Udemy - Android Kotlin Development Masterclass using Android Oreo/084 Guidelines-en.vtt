00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.930

so a calculator app looks like it



2

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.820

centers the array of buttons in portrait



3

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.320

so you can see on the screen there but



4

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.139

if we move over to the landscape layout



5

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.360

it's obvious that things aren't centered



6

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.420

in fact I'll be back in portrait we've



7

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.070

taken advantage of the fact that the



8

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.410

layout contains a scented widget that's



9

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.450

very close to the width of the buttons



10

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.000

so we're able to constrain the key



11

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.329

button which every call was button 7 to



12

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.790

the new number in a text widget and have



13

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.710

something that looks pretty central on



14

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.170

the screen we didn't really Center the



15

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.030

buttons though and obviously in layers



16

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.340

okay it becomes very obvious that we



17

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.190

didn't now the landscape layer does



18

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.289

still work quite well and you may not



19

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.670

actually even feel that the buttons



20

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.559

should be centered as they look all



21

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.629

right where they are now I tend to agree



22

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.359

but it is useful to know how to Center a



23

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.309

group of widgets and this is a good



24

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.960

opportunity to look at a couple of ways



25

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.629

to do this now for this particular layer



26

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.489

there's actually a third approach you



27

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.980

could take and that's using chains and



28

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.320

these became available with a recent



29

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.360

release of the constraint layout but



30

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.070

there was no support for them in the



31

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.340

Android studio to layout designer you



32

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.420

know they're not always appropriate



33

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.369

which is why I'm showing you these other



34

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.009

two approaches first and in fact I'll



35

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.659

create a separate video to show you how



36

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.090

to use chains later so in the next few



37

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.619

videos we're going to have a look at one



38

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.320

way we can Center groups of widgets I've



39

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.880

been kind of set your challenge to



40

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.860

Center them another way and if you keep



41

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.170

in mind the concept of a key widget that



42

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.060

all the others are constrained to then



43

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.740

you should be able to work the challenge



44

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.600

out so you want to start off with the



45

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.549

calculator app loaded in Android studio



46

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.009

yes I've got and open the landscape



47

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.439

version of the layout for editing and I



48

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.180

suggest you close down the project pane



49

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.770

as well so that there's more room on the



50

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.200

screen and again I've done that so what



51

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.219

we're going to do is we're going to



52

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.530

start by centering the to edit text



53

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.840

widgets now because there's only two of



54

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.030

those it's easier to then see what's



55

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.159

going on first I'm going to show you



56

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.869

guidelines which is what we're going to



57

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.850

be using to constrain the widgets tune



58

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.979

now god lines don't appear in the



59

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.350

palette of widgets but you can place one



60

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.910

on the layout by right-clicking the



61

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.900

layout and selecting helpers I can come



62

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.370

down here and select helpers and I can



63

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.420

click on add vertical



64

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.090

or add horizontal guideline now because



65

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.230

we want to Center things horizontally



66

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.569

we're going to be choosing the option to



67

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.090

add vertical guidelines but you can also



68

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.160

come up here to the toolbar there's an



69

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.540

option there to add a vertical guideline



70

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.660

or horizontal guideline so I'm going to



71

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.810

click on add vertical guideline and by



72

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.340

the way it's easy to see this in the



73

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.080

blueprint because it doesn't show in the



74

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.540

designer until you move the mouse over



75

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.150

into the designer side but I've got it



76

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.890

cook this set up in blueprint mode as



77

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.050

you can see and by the way sometimes



78

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.760

when you go to add a guideline it



79

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.650

doesn't appear and you can see here that



80

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.330

it didn't appear for me when I did that



81

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.370

but you can come down here into the



82

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.310

component tree and you can see that it's



83

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.269

been added and the bottom one you can



84

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.820

click on there to select it now



85

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.160

guidelines have widths and properties



86

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.690

showing on the right-hand properties



87

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.370

panel as you can see over here when I've



88

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.050

clicked it but there's little point



89

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.640

changing them and that's because they



90

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.430

don't behave like normal widgets and the



91

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.680

documentation which I'll take you to now



92

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.910

you can see the link on the screen there



93

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.220

it actually mentions that vertical



94

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.410

guidelines have a width of 0 and the



95

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.209

height of the constraint layout parent



96

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.100

and horizontal guidelines have a height



97

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.320

of 0 and the width of their constraint



98

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.329

layout parent so in other words there's



99

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.430

no point altering the layout width and



100

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.459

layout height attributes for a guideline



101

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.500

in fact there's no point altering any of



102

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.239

their attributes the only thing you can



103

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.130

change is how far along the layout they



104

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.400

are if you go back to Android studio so



105

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.989

you can drag them left and right



106

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.269

to position them on the land now



107

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.920

obviously a horizontal guideline would



108

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.200

be dragged up and down instead so



109

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.640

although I'm working with a vertical



110

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.590

guideline here the same thing applies to



111

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.390

horizontal guidelines just the other way



112

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.549

around now the guidelines got a measure



113

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.160

showing how far along the left and left



114

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.299

edge of the height we are as a



115

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.100

percentage and if I just dragged it over



116

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.750

a little bit you can see that number is



117

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.880

increasing as I'm dragging it over to



118

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.459

the right now I can also measure from



119

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.560

the right edge instead by clicking on



120

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.729

the top of the guideline so I want to do



121

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.459

that now and you can see the number has



122

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.169

now changed and we will actually and



123

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.510

we're actually now measuring from the



124

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.210

right hand side to the left in fact each



125

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.310

time it's eclectic switches from left I



126

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.720

can click on it again and went to right



127

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.160

when I click on it again



128

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.140

it's now in percentage - and that's a



129

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.450

percentage of how far along from either



130

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.160

from the left-hand side that we're



131

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.560

positioned at the moment and keeping



132

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.000

like that sometimes these don't work



133

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.950

quite right until you actually move in a



134

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.240

little bit so you might have to move the



135

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.640

guideline before this takes effect but



136

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.960

I'm actually going to move this over now



137

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.770

to exactly 50% which is a percentage so



138

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.360

therefore what's directly in the middle



139

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.090

of the screen and as I mentioned before



140

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.430

I suggest you close the project pane and



141

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.930

work just with the blueprint because



142

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.310

that gives you more space to see what's



143

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.440

going on so again if I want this



144

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.900

guideline centered which I do you just



145

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.340

need to click until we get the



146

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.870

percentage showing and then move it and



147

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.270

so it's on 50% and we're now directly



148

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.630

centered in the middle of the layout so



149

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.130

what I'm going to do now is delete the



150

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.590

right-hand constraint of the new number



151

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.540

widget then I'm going to constrain it to



152

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.280

the guideline instead I want to come



153

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.860

over here select the new number Widgit



154

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.900

I'm going to delete the constraint which



155

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.520

is currently constrained to the result



156

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.010

edit text delete that but then I'm going



157

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.800

to constrain it to the guideline instead



158

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.110

so you can see over there now the right



159

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.660

sorry the result and it Texas consistent



160

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.180

is constrained at the moment to the



161

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.250

right hand side but we'll leave that



162

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.270

what we're going to do is I'm going to



163

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.340

select that and we're going to now



164

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.250

constrain that to the guideline on its



165

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.160

left like so and both the new number and



166

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.130

result edittext Sanel constrained to the



167

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.620

guideline so basically centered in there



168

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.180

half of a layup as a result of what



169

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.490

we've done now before I go any further



170

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.650

it's going to be a lot easy to clear all



171

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.180

the constraints on the layout and



172

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.300

recreate them rather than trying to crit



173

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.100

to what change the various button



174

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.960

constraints and that's because if you



175

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.520

miss one it can slow you down while you



176

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.470

try to work out or something's not



177

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.450

working so in other words when you're



178

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.669

making a radical change to a layout as



179

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.100

we're about to do here my suggestion is



180

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.710

to clear all the constraints first using



181

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.300

the clear-all constraint buttons on the



182

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.700

toolbar and this is also a good time to



183

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.440

make sure that auto connect is turned



184

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.870

off so I'm going to come over here you



185

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.940

can see that AutoCAD X turned off but



186

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.290

I'm going to click on the key role



187

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.720

constraints button this one here to



188

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.060

remove all constraints all right so now



189

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.080

what I'm going to do is I'm going to



190

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.760

recreate the constraints for the two



191

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.480

edit text we



192

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.580

it's constraining them on their inner



193

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.410

edges to the guideline and also to the



194

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.420

top of the layout let's go ahead and do



195

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.300

that starting with new number constrain



196

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.000

it to the guideline and also constrain



197

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.160

it to the top of the layout I'm also



198

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.640

going to constrain result the guideline



199

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.760

and also to the top now there's no need



200

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.400

to constrain their outer edges but you



201

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.410

can't do that if you want to if you



202

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.180

decide to do that set the layout with



203

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.580

attributes to match constraint for each



204

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.710

edit text rather than a wrapper let's



205

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.360

call content but I'm not going to do



206

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.700

that and in addition you could use a



207

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.620

baseline constraint to line them up



208

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.170

vertically if you prefer which is what



209

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.580

we had before I deleted all the



210

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.070

constraints all right now the margins



211

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.710

that I've set are a little bit too or



212

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.110

leaves the and it takes a little bit



213

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.370

close to each other so let's actually



214

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.650

change their inner margins to 16 DP



215

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.230

instead I'm gonna go ahead and for the



216

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.920

new number



217

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.280

edit text change it to 16 and then for



218

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.760

the result change its left constraint to



219

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.380

16 as well just a little bit further



220

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.350

apart now at this point we can't switch



221

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.470

to portrait to check the centering and



222

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.970

that's because portrait uses a different



223

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.370

layout and that brings up something that



224

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.650

you want to bear in mind is if you



225

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.840

create if you decide to create different



226

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.580

portrait and landscape layouts for your



227

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.740

app when you do so you've got two



228

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.930

layouts to maintain instead of just one



229

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.420

so if you can make a single layout work



230

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.700

in both modes then it does make life a



231

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.070

lot easier to do that now what we can do



232

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.140

here is try different devices though and



233

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.000

I'm gonna see how this looks on another



234

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.490

device by clicking on the option on the



235

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.340

toolbar let's just try selecting a nexus



236

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.670

one let's see what that looks like so it



237

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.380

looks like a horizontally anyway because



238

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.820

of course the buttons are still dropping



239

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.919

off the bottom of the screen but at the



240

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.030

moment we're just considering the



241

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.340

horizontal alignment so that's good it's



242

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.349

working okay so let's go back to our



243

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:43.200

Nexus 4 it's easier to use it because



244

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.000

it's going to be a little bit easy to



245

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.220

work with the buttons so to send to the



246

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.230

buttons what we need is a god we need



247

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.610

the guideline to run down the gap



248

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.370

between the button 8 and but annoying so



249

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.570

in other words there's two groups of



250

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.400

buttons one on the left-hand side and



251

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.960

one on the right-hand side of the card



252

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.490

line so we know ahead



253

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.500

a different key button so instead of



254

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.540

everything being aligned to button seven



255

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.430

or the other buttons will take their



256

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.040

lead from button nine now I could use



257

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.620

button eight instead the important thing



258

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.480

he said it's a button at the top and



259

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.610

next to the guideline and I thought it



260

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.440

easy to work with just the blueprint for



261

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.120

things like this and I've obviously been



262

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.680

just using the blueprint in this video



263

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.810

but that way everything's much bigger on



264

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.730

the screen and we've got more space to



265

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.339

work with now you can also use the plus



266

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:29.070

button over here if you want to zoom



267

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.170

everything up which can make creating



268

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.510

the constraints a lot easier and also



269

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.740

collapsing the palette and the



270

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.839

componentry gives more space to the



271

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.490

screen or on the screen as well so I'm



272

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.410

going to go ahead and do that close



273

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.870

those two off just so we've got a little



274

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.029

bit more space to look at then things as



275

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:47.279

it seemed up a little bit more all right



276

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:48.690

so we're going to split the group of



277

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.690

buttons into two with button Owen on the



278

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.060

right-hand side of the guideline and



279

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.000

button eight on the left so on the right



280

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.620

each button in the second column



281

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.360

starting with the slash we'll need a



282

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.610

baseline constraint to the button on its



283

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.500

left and it should also have its left



284

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.480

edge constrained to the right edge of



285

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.390

the button on its left so let's start by



286

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.670

splitting the two groups of buttons I'm



287

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.010

going to get the first row the right



288

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.510

edge button that the eight of the



289

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.149

buttons that's darling with nine six



290

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:19.740

three and equals and move them over to



291

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.120

the right-hand side of the guideline for



292

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.770

now so if now got our groups of buttons



293

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.990

and two different sides there on the



294

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.550

right as I mentioned each button in the



295

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.380

second column that's starting with the



296

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.660

slash here that needs a baseline



297

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.180

constraint to the button on its left and



298

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.010

it should also have a left it have its



299

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.140

left edge constrained to the right edge



300

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.520

of the button on the slip so let's go



301

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.589

ahead and do that we're going to open up



302

00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:49.220

the baseline constrain that to the nine



303

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.630

likewise for the asterisks or the



304

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.260

multiplication baseline and come over



305

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.589

here and add that to the six next one



306

00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:01.220

any minors we're going to do the same



307

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.200

baseline and constrain it oops



308

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.910

based on constraint there and then the



309

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.720

plus we're going to do the same thing



310

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.770

and strain of this you can see there



311

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.230

when for each of those four buttons as



312

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.000

well we should have its left edge and



313

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.680

strain to the right edge of the button



314

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.750

on its left so a similar thing there



315

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.450

we're going to click on that and



316

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:37.899

constrain it for all four



317

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:40.310

okay so you can see that we've got a



318

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.259

baseline constraint for each of these



319

00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:45.800

now and we've also got the constraint



320

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.689

it's on the on the left for each one



321

00:11:47.689 --> 00:11:49.850

constrained to the right of the buttons



322

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.670

on its left alright so next we need to



323

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.129

constrain the top edge of each button in



324

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:57.860

the first column to be ATP from the



325

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.870

button above it so start basically



326

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.519

starting with the six and working down



327

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.829

the column let's go ahead and do that so



328

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:05.269

the six I'm going to constrain to the



329

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:08.059

nine I'm going to make sure you've got a



330

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.410

margin of eight which we can see in the



331

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.420

inspector the three we're going to



332

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.449

constrain to the six and checking on the



333

00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:16.939

DP wheel ATP they're showing in the



334

00:12:16.939 --> 00:12:18.889

inspector in an equal sign I'm also



335

00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:21.439

going to constrain to the three as you



336

00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:23.569

can see there okay so that's all done



337

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:26.300

now finally those three buttons these



338

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.769

three buttons here the six the three and



339

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:29.870

the equals in this case they should have



340

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.579

their left edges constrained to the left



341

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:33.230

edge of the button above again the



342

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.660

starting with six so let's do that so



343

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.009

with the six I'm going to left



344

00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:41.569

constrained with a nine with a three



345

00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:45.620

we're going to constrain to the six and



346

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.059

with the equals we're going to constrain



347

00:12:47.059 --> 00:12:50.269

to the three but where I'm going to do



348

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:53.589

that is also change the margins for six



349

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:55.910

to zero so that it lines up correctly



350

00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:02.120

for three to zero and also the equals to



351

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.079

zero as well okay and you saw that they



352

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:07.610

appeared to be snipped until it changed



353

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.019

or they left margin to zero which I've



354

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:11.149

done there so at this point now I should



355

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:12.680

be able to drag the nine button around



356

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.199

and the other seven buttons will follow



357

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:18.319

with it you can see that that's actually



358

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:20.389

working and it's working quite nicely so



359

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:22.399

I could have actually done this work on



360

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:24.199

the left-hand side so I could have



361

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:25.250

actually instead of moving these



362

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.170

manually which I did I drag them over I



363

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.269

could have done all the work until they



364

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:30.529

were all constrain together then just



365

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:32.540

drag the one button over instead of



366

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.970

doing what I did which was select all



367

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.490

eight buttons and then we drag over that



368

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.899

way either way would would have worked



369

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:41.240

just fine all right so let's end the



370

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.370

video here in the next video we need to



371

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.199

start working on the left-hand side of



372

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.480

the block and that's going to be a



373

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.220

mirror image to what we've done to the



374

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.170

buttons on the right so I'll see you in



375

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.470

the next
