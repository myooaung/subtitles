00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.570

In this video, we're going to create our



2

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.600

very first Android application. So if you



3

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.400

haven't already start to render a studio



4

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.710

application and if you're on a Mac you



5

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.510

can go into the Applications folder to



6

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.640

do that and double-click your Android



7

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.689

studio and if you're on a Windows



8

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.980

machine you can just go into the start



9

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.320

menu and type Android and click the icon



10

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.869

when it appears. Now Linux you can use



11

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.250

the technique I showed you in that video



12

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.109

to access the Android studio desktop



13

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.630

entry that we created. So once you've



14

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.489

started Android studio we're going to



15

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.530

create our first application by clicking



16

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.399

on start a new Android studio project.



17

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.960

Now once you do that a series of screens



18

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.180

will appear to ask you for some basic



19

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.370

information about the project you want



20

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.469

to create the first screen asks you for



21

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.000

the application name and we're going to



22

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.829

keep it simple and call our first



23

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.550

application HelloWorld. Now the next part



24

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.200

is what might be a bit confusing the



25

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.960

company domain, so Android applications



26

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.750

use the concept of a package name to



27

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.530

make sure that your application



28

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.589

reference is unique across the world now



29

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.690

that's a Java convention but it's used



30

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.250

for all sorts of other things as well



31

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.740

the internet couldn't function if domain



32

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.800

names weren't unique worldwide now the



33

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.240

reason that it needs to be unique is



34

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.860

when you eventually go to upload your



35

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.319

code to the Google Play Store to make it



36

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.270

available for sale you need to have a



37

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.459

unique identifier that's not used by



38

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:25.860

anyone else. So what Google suggests you



39

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.959

do is type your company - main name so



40

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:29.640

in my case I'm going to use my domain



41

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.560

name which is Learn Programming dot



42

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080

Academy, if I delete this and type it in



43

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.300

again as I'm typing it down the bottom



44

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.250

the package the name is getting updated



45

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.940

learn programming dot academy, now



46

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.619

Android studio uses this with verse



47

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.560

domain name to create the package,



48

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.239

so I'll type in Learn Programming dot



49

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:51.140

Academy but you came back and said



50

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.729

Academy dot Learn Programming dot



51

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.739

hello world. Now the hello world by the



52

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:58.080

way was a representation of what I typed



53

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.940

in the application name field at the top



54

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.130

more inner space is an all in lowercase.



55

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.319

Now if you haven't got your own domain



56

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.360

name that's okay for training and



57

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.190

testing purposes there's a set of



58

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.630

example domains that have been set aside



59

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.360

for people to use example.com and



60

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.090

example.org at all these example domains



61

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.310

so you could just use example.org



62

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.970

and it'll be



63

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.100

the package name or that example that



64

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.110

hello world for you, if you want more



65

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.700

information you can visite example.org



66

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.040

or example.com in a browser and there's



67

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.180

a link you can actually click when you



68

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.830

get there for more information so you



69

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.960

can literally have anything there but



70

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.640

just do note that once you're creating



71

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.990

your own applications and you're at the



72

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.550

stage of uploading them to the app store



73

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.310

then you need to have a domain name so



74

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.860

you should really make that unique, so at



75

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.090

the moment though I'm going to go ahead



76

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.470

and use mine which I'll be using through



77

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.390

this course learn programming dot



78

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.190

academy. So next you need to find the



79

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.080

location where you're going to start



80

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.060

saving your projects now this is just



81

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.800

like a word processing document in a



82

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.330

sense that you need to choose somewhere



83

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.220

to save them I've really got my



84

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.690

locations to that in this case I'm



85

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.520

putting them in my desktop in a folder



86

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.280

called Android O Kotlin, but so you can



87

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.320

just choose any location by coming over



88

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.910

here and clicking on the three dots the



89

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.090

ellipsis and selecting a folder to store



90

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.030

all your Android programs in and note



91

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.860

that when you do that and choose a



92

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.800

location at the end Android studio will



93

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.840

helpfully add hello world and that will



94

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.010

actually be a subfolder



95

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.440

containing our application in other



96

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.840

words creating a subfolder based our a



97

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.519

subfolder of the Android O Kotlin



98

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.250

folder then ultimately containers hello



99

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.380

world project and as you create lots of



100

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.030

projects and she moves through this



101

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.769

course there's going to be one subfolder



102

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.140

for each of those projects and that's so



103

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.360

that they're neatly separated and you're



104

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.860

not running any risk of actually getting



105

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.480

into difficulties in some way by



106

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.489

overwriting code, so make sure you don't



107

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.870

try to put two projects in the same



108

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.100

folder that's going to cause all sorts



109

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.970

of problems.



110

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.739

Now there's another important setting



111

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.840

here we need to make on the screen so



112

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.610

make sure you tick the include Kotlin



113

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.370

support box that causes android studio to



114

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.320

generate Kotlin code rather than java



115

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.690

code. Now this is the Kotlin version of



116

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.230

the course,



117

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.989

so we definitely want Kotlin here it is



118

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.640

possible by the way to mix Kotlin and



119

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.100

Java in the same project but for our



120

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.720

purposes we want Kotlin to be the



121

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.030

default so make sure that box is ticked



122

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.769

before clicking next and you can see in



123

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.979

my case that is now this next screen it



124

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.840

can be a little bit intimidating at



125

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.130

least the first few times you see it



126

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.900

might be thinking what's all this about.



127

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.360

Well, firstly before I start talking



128

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.300

about minimum SDK these things here they



129

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.610

wear TV Android auto Android things



130

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.380

don't normally be



131

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.660

ticked. Now where is Android



132

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.890

functionality to run Android



133

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.990

applications and things like watches and



134

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.510

so forth in other words wearable devices.



135

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.230

Now the next one TV is for Android TV so



136

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.360

that you can create applications that



137

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.850

work with Android TV and that's the TVs



138

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.020

that are running the Android TV



139

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.170

operating system Android auto well



140

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.370

that's actually yeah for cars



141

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.590

automobiles literally, again it's a



142

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.450

special version that runs on that so you



143

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.820

can create applications for cars and



144

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.890

last but by no means least Android



145

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.810

things enables you to create apps for



146

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.660

for IOT devices now we aren't going to



147

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.250

be targeting any of those in this course



148

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.290

because to actually do them justice we



149

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.700

need to create a course in their own



150

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.920

right for them so you're leaving all



151

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.100

these disabled for this course but the



152

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.390

important thing of this screen is this



153

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.930

minimum SDK talks about here at the top



154

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.530

so what is that well SDK stands for



155

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.450

software development kit which is the



156

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.820

version of the Android software of the



157

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.070

Android operating system the minimum



158

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.360

version that your application is going



159

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.420

to run on now will be dropped down the



160

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.270

list, you go all the way back to Android



161

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.250

we can go all the way back to Android 4



162

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.590

if we wanted to literally a people API



163

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.810

14 Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich



164

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.020

that's API 14 million a longer



165

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.390

supporting older Android versions so



166

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.950

that's the earliest version we can



167

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.650

choose here now by monitoring the



168

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.230

devices that connect to the Play Store,



169

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.120

Google can track which versions of



170

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.100

Android are still being used and they've



171

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.240

worked out that there really aren't many



172

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.820

devices if any still running versions of



173

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.090

Android before API 14 now that's great



174

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.380

if you want to fully support everything



175

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.780

but by adding support for all versions



176

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.460

of the Android operating system going



177

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.040

right back to version 4 we're limited to



178

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.050

some other functionality we can use and



179

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.240

that's because as new versions of the



180

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.920

Android operating system have come out



181

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.320

Google have updated it and improved it



182

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.180

and added a lot of features so



183

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.530

consequently it's generally not



184

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.030

recommended to go back and say that



185

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.320

you're going to support that minimum



186

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.660

version so it is a bit of a trade-off



187

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.520

between the percentage of people who can



188

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.350

access an older version and the



189

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.330

functionality that you want to have in



190

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.910

your application now as a general rule



191

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.370

I'd suggest that you set your minimum version



192

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.630

to target Android 4.2 this is API 17



193

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.550

which is jellybean then when you select



194

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.620

each version the display updates to show



195

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.840

the percentage of devices that your app



196

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.090

will work on, you can see here that API



197

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.419

17 and higher will include 96% of



198

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.460

devices that are active in the Google



199

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.110

Play Store then that number will



200

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.970

increase as older versions are updated



201

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.919

or replaced but at the time I'm



202

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.020

recording this 96% of all Android



203

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.780

devices active today are using Android



204

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.650

4.2 jelly bean or later. Now there's a



205

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.590

reason I suggest API 17 and that's



206

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.090

because support for right-to-left



207

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.940

languages was included in that version



208

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.380

so you could target in an earlier API



209

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.530

and you've got an API 16 phone that you



210

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.660

want to use for example then probably



211

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.550

would make sense to choose API 16



212

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.160

instead but I'm comfortable saying that



213

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.130

you should use API 17 but I'll also be



214

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.169

showing you how to change that if you



215

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.580

change your mind and decide to support



216

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.710

an earlier version. We'll see how to do



217

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.110

that in a later video but by choosing



218

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.760

API 17 here



219

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.470

anyone who's running an Android version



220

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.169

going right back to Android API 17 or



221

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.240

higher will be able to run the



222

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.130

applications you create and that's again



223

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.919

it's 96% of users if they're running an



224

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.720

older version they won't be able to



225

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.780

download and run the application and



226

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.919

incidentally the ability to set a



227

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:07.349

minimum SDK is why you don't have to



228

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:09.479

install all those older Android versions



229

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:11.400

when we were configuring Android in the



230

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.500

SDK manager so I'm going to talk a bit



231

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.169

more about compatibility later but you



232

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:18.180

can see the older is decay levels are



233

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.949

available even though we didn't install



234

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:22.229

all the previous versions all right so



235

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:24.090

I'm selecting API 17 I'm going to click



236

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:24.750

on next,



237

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.970

we then get to the template screens that



238

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.229

we've discussed in this section of the



239

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:30.870

course. Now these are the various



240

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.360

types of projects that you can create by



241

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.580

default with Android studio and as



242

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.800

previously mentioned it'll automatically



243

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.630

add code and layouts for you depending



244

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.430

on which one you choose you know once



245

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.169

again if the exact template isn't



246

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.270

available because perhaps Google have



247

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.440

changed things by the time you're



248

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.570

watching this video, no need to worry so



249

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.850

I'm going to use empty activity here



250

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.339

which is selected for me currently so



251

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:55.410

just choose the one if that's closest in



252

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.930

appearance if empty activity isn't available



253

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.270

all the names changed, so do that and



254

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.700

click on next and finally just before



255

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.860

Android studio creates the project and



256

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.140

generates the code for us it's asking



257

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.990

for the name of the activity and layout.



258

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.040

Now I am going to be talking about



259

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.680

activities and layouts a bit later but



260

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.209

for now we can just accept the default



261

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:17.670

names then Android studio is suggesting



262

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.470

and we've already seen how both of these



263

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.690

names are used in the previous videos in



264

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.850

this section, so the suggested names are



265

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.440

fine and quite descriptive so we're



266

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.870

actually going to go with those so



267

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.490

there's also a couple of checkboxes and



268

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.560

normally you'd leave these both checked



269

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.709

this first one generate layout file that



270

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:36.720

causes Android studio to create a



271

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.610

default layout file from the project



272

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.290

that's the activity underscore main



273

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.140

layout. Now most apps you create would



274

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.790

need at least one layout or they



275

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.649

wouldn't be able to display anything so



276

00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:48.120

you may as well get Android studio to



277

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.160

create the file for you. Now if you're



278

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.360

creating an app that will run as a



279

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.310

service and have no youth and will have



280

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.290

no user interface then you could and



281

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.750

tick that box in the second check box



282

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.209

it's a good idea to keep checked that's



283

00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:02.730

the backwards compatibility check box if



284

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.010

you want ticket your app will only run



285

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.020

on the latest version of Android well I



286

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.520

guess that's not strictly true because



287

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.290

you can't change the specific version



288

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.750

but you'll be targeting a single version



289

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.910

of Android and the app won't work in



290

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.040

earlier versions and then we're going to



291

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.990

be talking about app compat in detail



292

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.120

later so for now please just take my



293

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.650

word for it and I'll leave that box



294

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:29.370

ticked and then click on finish and you



295

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.800

saw that the progress was updated as



296

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.020

Android studio created the project and



297

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.300

it took a bit of time and then the top



298

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.800

the bottom left-hand corner it says



299

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.839

gradle build finished in two seconds and



300

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.220

you can see we've now got this project



301

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.800

showing on the screen it does take a



302

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.329

while the first time you create an



303

00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:47.610

Android project in Android studio but



304

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.540

the next time you write from that



305

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.459

project it should be a lot quicker and



306

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:51.930

just a reminder not to try and do too



307

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.310

much until it's finished building the



308

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.589

project expanding the directories in the



309

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:57.600

project panes okay but editing code or



310

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.790

changing layouts isn't a good idea



311

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.649

until you see that build finished in the



312

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:03.779

bottom left hand corner now by default



313

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:06.089

you'll see a tip of the day dialog I've



314

00:11:06.089 --> 00:11:08.010

already disabled it on mine but I mean



315

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.150

come in here and have a look



316

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.180

tip of the day the by default you



317

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.790

tip of the day dialogue pop-up and that



318

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.510

can be interesting



319

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.130

it shows interesting features in Android



320

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.170

studio that can make you more productive



321

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.510

and until you've used Android studio but



322

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.279

it probably won't make a lot of sense



323

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:25.470

though so I suggest us closing it when



324

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.000

Android studio starts until you've got



325

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.459

more experience with Android studio the



326

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:30.930

tips can help you become more productive



327

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.839

once they start making sense and if you



328

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:35.010

want you can stop it appearing which



329

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.950

I've done by unchecking these show tips



330

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.670

on startup check box over here but in



331

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.260

this case I'm just going to close it if



332

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.190

you haven't done that and you want to



333

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.290

see it again go to the help menu and you



334

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.000

can select tip of the day here to bring



335

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.339

a backup all right so let's finish now



336

00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:52.350

and we've got some things that have come



337

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.330

up on the screen sometimes you see a



338

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.040

message that Gradle files have changed



339

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.450

in which case just click on this sync



340

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.910

now button at the top right hand side



341

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.040

of the screen and that should clear the



342

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.630

message and greater will build the



343

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.149

project again and if you're wanting work



344

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:08.130

greater with it's an open-source build



345

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.920

automation system, so basically pulls



346

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.200

together all the bits of the project to



347

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.970

create the application file that can be



348

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.490

installed on an Android device. Now if



349

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.140

you use external libraries such as the



350

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.910

YouTube API that we'll be using in a



351

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.160

later section of the course then you can



352

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.170

tell Gradle about that and it sorts



353

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.850

everything out for you so you don't



354

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.529

really need to know more about that at



355

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:30.180

this stage because Android studio runs



356

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.310

Gradle for you when you come to run the



357

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.150

app. Alright so this video is getting a



358

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.620

little bit long, let's end the video here



359

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.240

in the next video we'll continue on our



360

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.670

journey to creating our first app,



361

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.660

I'll see you in the next video.
