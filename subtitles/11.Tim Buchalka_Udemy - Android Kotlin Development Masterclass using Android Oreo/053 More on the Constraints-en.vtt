00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.540

Alright so I'm gonna ask you to think



2

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.940

a bit now. Now we haven't really covered



3

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.410

constraining widgets to each other



4

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.540

although it did briefly do it when I



5

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.880

added the button to what we can see on



6

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.289

the screen now so I have a car with this



7

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.420

remember that you can't really break



8

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.240

anything so your challenge is that using



9

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.220

constraints and changing the scale type



10

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.470

of the image change the layout from what



11

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.779

we have now on screen we want to change



12

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.779

to look like this now remember that you



13

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.790

have to delete a constraint before you



14

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.399

can create a new one. So have a play it



15

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.079

get used to the layout designer and see



16

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.050

if you can change the layout to this one



17

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.480

so pause the video here and have a go at



18

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.280

doing that and I'll see you when you get



19

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.120

back in a few minutes all right so



20

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.379

hopefully you managed to achieve they



21

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.360

don't have a good attempt and now



22

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.770

understanding a little bit more about



23

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.320

how the layout designer works so my



24

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.579

solution we're going to start by



25

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.280

changing the constraint so that the top



26

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.739

of the image view is constrained to the



27

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.229

bottom of the button so we'll look over



28

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.510

here now and click on the top circle of



29

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.100

the image view and delete the existing



30

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.650

from straight let me go ahead and do



31

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.520

that delete it and then I want to grab



32

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.830

the constraint click on that on the



33

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.600

image view and drag it over to the



34

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.790

bottom of the button so that the image



35

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.130

view is now constrained to the button



36

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.350

and you can see that helpfully the



37

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.240

blueprint shows the constraints and



38

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.950

provides a visual indication of where



39

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.020

the image view currently is allowed to



40

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.270

fit now the image view itself is



41

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.880

currently a fixed size so to make it



42

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.740

feel the space that it's constrained in



43

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.720

would it go over here now and click on



44

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.729

the in Alliance to change it to match



45

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.829

constraints both vertically and



46

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.600

horizontally so I'm going to click on



47

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.439

that vertically and horizontally and you



48

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.880

can see now that I've changed it to



49

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.560

match constraints the image view is now



50

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.570

a lot larger



51

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.880

now finally the image scout type is



52

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.210

currently set over here to fix X Y and



53

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.890

that's a consequence the image is being



54

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.250

scaled to fill the image view well we



55

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.380

actually want to scale to maintain the



56

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.160

aspect ratio so that it remains round so



57

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.260

the scale type has to be changed to



58

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.760

Center crop so I'm going to click on



59

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.170

undo that send a crop



60

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.210

and finally should also check the



61

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.490

inspector and make sure that all the



62

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.800

margins are correct now for the image



63

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.050

view to be centered in the space the



64

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.970

left and right margins should be equal



65

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.010

and so should the top and bottom margins



66

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.610

so we want to change those all to 8 DB



67

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.840

now currently you can see that today



68

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.070

we've got three out of four other



69

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.470

margins are set to 16 so I'm going to



70

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.110

set them all to 8 all right so that's



71

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.420

actually it so you're probably already



72

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.800

starting to see that this layout



73

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.020

designer is pretty cool and the



74

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.790

constraint system makes it much easier



75

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.550

to place widgets where you want and also



76

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.500

have them remain there relative to the



77

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.959

other widgets on the screen you know if



78

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.340

you've been using the relative layout



79

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.680

for much of your screen designs then you



80

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.420

should consider the relative layout is



81

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.550

pretty much dead now now there's still a



82

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.290

place for the linear layout for



83

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.120

simplicity and we will be looking at



84

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.220

that later in the course but for just



85

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.989

about everything else the new constraint



86

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.130

layout is a heck of a lot easier to use.



87

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.090

Alright so I'm going to finish this



88

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.489

introduction to creating layouts by



89

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.350

going through the steps needed to



90

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.260

produce the following layout now it



91

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.760

includes many of the kinds of things



92

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.799

that you'll want to do when creating



93

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.160

layouts there's a title constraint



94

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.410

layout at the top of the screen and text



95

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.660

to the right of that you know below the



96

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.430

title was an image and then there are



97

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.709

two buttons at the bottom right of the



98

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.780

screen now the image doesn't really



99

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.030

relate to the text but till you're here



100

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.190

to learn about the layout designer got



101

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.400

to get practice at downloading images



102

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.170

all right so let's have a go at creating



103

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.630

this new layout file and to do that we



104

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.070

need to actually create a new layout



105

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.950

file so if your project pane isn't so



106

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.350

open we may need to expand that and mine



107

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.730

isn't so I'm going to click on that



108

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.980

project to open it and we want to come



109

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.840

down here to layout which of course is



110

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.209

under the res folder we want to right



111

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.540

click on layout select new and select



112

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.019

layout resource file the other thing



113

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.459

that I didn't mention to do that you



114

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.720

should be doing is making sure that



115

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.669

you're in Android view so if by chance



116

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.160

you can't see this easily just come over



117

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.419

here and click on this drop-down and



118

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.940

select Android now I can't do this at



119

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.500

the moment because I've got this pop-up



120

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.370

window open



121

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.260

all right so I'm going to call this



122

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.690

layout no time has gone lay up so I'm



123

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.650

going to type that in there



124

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.889

another phone app so no let's call a app



125

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.750

now you don't need to type the dot XML



126

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.610

extension because Android studio will



127

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.949

provide that for you automatically now



128

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.130

the next thing over here root element



129

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.900

that means the type of layout to create



130

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.210

and currently that defaults to linear



131

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.760

layout now as I've mentioned before



132

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.690

we're going to be looking at linear



133

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.540

layout later but for this exercise we



134

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.580

want to constraint layout so I'm just



135

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.199

going to over type that they're gonna



136

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.479

delete linear layout and they're gonna



137

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.790

start typing constraint layout notice



138

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.290

that when I started typing that Android



139

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.180

Studios drop-down a list of likely



140

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.610

things so the one we want to choose here



141

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.130

is the Android support dot constraint



142

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.260

constraint layout so I'm gonna select



143

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.900

that by double clicking it and in



144

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.700

general it's a good idea to select from



145

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.800

the list when you get a situation like



146

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.139

that to prevent typing errors now



147

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.400

there's lots of other things that we can



148

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.710

actually type and select here but don't



149

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.690

worry about those for now we're gonna be



150

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.430

using those later in the course for now



151

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.289

just click on OK now why are we creating



152

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.510

this layout you want to make sure that



153

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.289

auto connect is enabled using the magnet



154

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.660

button on the designer toolbar now you



155

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.490

can see that in my case it was enabled



156

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.020

so I've just disabled it by clicking it



157

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.300

so I want to click it again and you'll



158

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.340

know that tire and the auto connect is



159

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.229

enabled if there's no solution or no



160

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.039

line over the on top of the magnet and



161

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.990

also if we just move our mouse cursor



162

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.180

over there it actually tells you there's



163

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.710

an option to turn over what I connect



164

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.110

which clearly means that it's on now



165

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.700

auto connect can sometimes get in the



166

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.039

way and cause problems and if you want



167

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.720

to create constraints that it can't work



168

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.669

out you will need to disable it



169

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.220

sometimes but I've turned it on now so



170

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.870

let's see what sort of a job it does of



171

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.169

this layout that we're creating



172

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.060

all right so we're going to shrink the



173

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.409

project pane here to make a bit more



174

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.379

space they will it drag a textview to



175

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.960

the top left of the screen now google of



176

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.349

helpfully categorized the widgets and it



177

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:35.849

will take you a while to remember where



178

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.069

the common ones are you can now click on



179

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:39.779

the various categories over in here to



180

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.419

see what they contain but don't try or



181

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.009

don't worry about trying to memorize it



182

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.900

all right now after a while you'll find



183

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.490

that you'll remember the widgets you use



184

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.789

most frequently so this top part



185

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:52.680

category here all unsurprisingly



186

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.229

contains all the widgets the others at



187

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.300

Google's idea of where things are and



188

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.150

may change now the textview widget



189

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.669

appears in the text category so I'm come



190

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:04.499

over here and click on text and there's



191

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.719

our textview so I'm going to drag that



192

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.180

to the top left hand corner of the



193

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.860

screen and release it when the vertical



194

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.439

and horizontal lines appear so when I



195

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.539

release this now now that I've got the



196

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.499

horizontal and vertical lines appearing



197

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:21.719

notice that the in the blueprint that



198

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:23.460

the textview is now automatically



199

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.560

constrained to the top of left edges of



200

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.659

the layer and we can see confirmation in



201

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:30.240

the top right hand corner in inspector



202

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.699

that we've got a constraint to the left



203

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.490

and also a constraint at the top now if



204

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.680

in your situation it hasn't created both



205

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.899

constraints then just drag the textview



206

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:42.029

slightly until you see those guidelines



207

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:43.800

that I showed you and it should then



208

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.560

work now the auto connect has done that



209

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.750

for us and it's pretty cool when you're



210

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.939

placing the widgets initially it does



211

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:53.370

work quite well but if it starts



212

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.960

creating constraints that you don't want



213

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.930

then you can turn it off personally I'm



214

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.490

not only turn it off once I placed all



215

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.710

my widgets that way again it's helped



216

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.839

when laying them out to start with but



217

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:05.310

then I take that control to put the



218

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.860

finishing touches to the layout now keep



219

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.360

in mind that auto connect will only



220

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.699

affect the widget that's currently being



221

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.589

moved so any other widgets in the layout



222

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:16.379

won't be affected all right so the next



223

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:18.270

thing we need to add is a box where



224

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.819

users can type their text now whenever



225

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:22.589

you want a widget to allow data entry



226

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:24.389

you'll probably want to use one of the



227

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:27.029

text fields widgets in this case we're



228

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:28.919

going to use a multi-line text widget



229

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:30.779

and we can see we've got this multi-line



230

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:33.060

text over here so we're going to drag



231

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.409

one of these over to the right of the



232

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.089

screen and we're going to place it roughly



233

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:39.599

lo the textview dragged it over in this



234

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.279

attract a neighbor you can see there's a



235

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:44.249

good visual representation and a good



236

00:08:44.249 --> 00:08:45.629

indication if you like of weather



237

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:48.329

constraints will be added just by the



238

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:51.240

dotted lines very good we can always



239

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.379

change those ladders I'm just going to



240

00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:55.620

leave it for there for now and you can



241

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.670

see now that I've done that I could



242

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.199

strain has automatically been added to



243

00:08:58.199 --> 00:09:00.809

the left and to the right of our



244

00:09:00.809 --> 00:09:04.379

multi-line text so that was auto connect



245

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:05.819

in action again it's it created the



246

00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:07.769

constraints but to keep in mind it



247

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:09.300

doesn't always create all the



248

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.699

constraints you want good thing is



249

00:09:11.699 --> 00:09:12.990

though that creating constraints



250

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.569

manually is so easy that it's not really



251

00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:17.370

worth spending too much time trying to



252

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.379

drop the widgets onto the layout exactly



253

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:22.079

in fact it can get very fiddly to get



254

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:24.540

this multi-line edit text widget to be



255

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.220

constrained to the text view which is



256

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.319

what we want to do the layout designer



257

00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:29.819

seems to prefer to constrain it to the



258

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.199

left edge of the screen and you can see



259

00:09:31.199 --> 00:09:32.670

in my case it constrained it to the left



260

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.819

and to the right now auto-connect may



261

00:09:35.819 --> 00:09:38.069

have created a top constraint - it



262

00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:39.540

didn't in my case but that may have for



263

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.579

you it really depends on whether you get



264

00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:44.040

the guidelines before dropping the widget



265

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.230

it doesn't always manage to work out



266

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.029

what you want so consider it a nice



267

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:49.949

feature but make sure you always check



268

00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:51.899

to make sure you have the constraints



269

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:54.600

that you actually wanted now in this



270

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.069

case I don't want the text field



271

00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:58.079

wandering up the screen it should always



272

00:09:58.079 --> 00:10:00.959

start below the title so the way to do



273

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:02.639

that is to make sure that there's a



274

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:04.139

constraint from the top of the text



275

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:06.540

field to the bottom of the titles text



276

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.029

view so I'm going to drag the top circle



277

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:10.980

up to the bottom of the title and



278

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.329

obviously you laineebee doing that if



279

00:10:12.329 --> 00:10:14.040

auto-connect didn't do that for you and



280

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.240

obviously it didn't do that to me either



281

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.490

so I'm going to drag it from the top of



282

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.860

the multi-line text to the bottom of the



283

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.970

text view and by the way if it did



284

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.379

create a constraint at the top of the



285

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:26.730

screen you would have needed to delete



286

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.309

that first by waiting for the red circle



287

00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:30.809

to appear above the constraint handle



288

00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:33.149

but as you saw in my case we didn't have



289

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:36.269

a top constraint now when working with



290

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.399

these constraint handles it's actually



291

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.649

worth waiting a second once the mouse



292

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:43.290

pointer is over the circle once you see



293

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.120

the handle flash then you can start



294

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.790

dragging I've had problems if I started



295

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.550

dragging early and it can



296

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.890

up dragging the entire widget rather



297

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.990

than creating a constraint so it is



298

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.899

usually best to wait alright so the next



299

00:10:56.899 --> 00:10:59.029

constraint on the text field is to



300

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:01.100

anchor it to the right edge of the



301

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.769

layout now that way it can be resized as



302

00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:05.990

the orientation changes or different



303

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.570

sized screens are used now in my case



304

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.060

I've already got it



305

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.899

constrained to the right-hand side but



306

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:12.860

I'm just going to delete that again



307

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.019

anyway and I'm going to constrain it



308

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:17.360

again by dragging over to the right edge



309

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.790

of the layout all right so the final



310

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.680

constraint should now be from the left



311

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.230

edge of the text field to the right edge



312

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.170

of the text view so what I'm going to do



313

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.260

is delete that constraint by clicking it



314

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.320

then I'm going to drag from the left



315

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.760

edge of our text field



316

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.550

to the right edge of a text view now to



317

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.470

keep it centered horizontally in its



318

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.110

space we want to use the inspector to



319

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.269

set both the left and right margins to



320

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:46.370

the same value so I'm going to click on



321

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.230

that to make sure that it's selected and



322

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.930

I'm going to use 16 DP bearing in mind



323

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.029

that because we've created a new layout



324

00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:55.490

the default has been reset back to 8 for



325

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.230

the default margins you could change



326

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.480

that if you wanted to 2:16 the drop down



327

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.700

over here though once I click on that



328

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.700

gives us the most common margin settings



329

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.230

but you can actually type in different



330

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.700

valleys if you want you've seen me do



331

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.440

that in the past but I'm going to select



332

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.959

16 for left and 16 for the right margins



333

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:16.310

and again as we talked about setting the



334

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.170

value you want in the default margins



335

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.630

Button says having to set each margin



336

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.940

individually the constraints will be



337

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.459

created with the default margin and by



338

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.589

the way I generally create constraints



339

00:12:27.589 --> 00:12:29.690

in the blueprint but you can also drag



340

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.760

the constraint circles in the design if



341

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.860

you prefer that's useful if you're sure



342

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.329

the screen spaces have turned off the



343

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:37.520

blueprint all right so let's finish this



344

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.860

video here now in the next video we'll



345

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.320

continue on enhancing this layout we're



346

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.120

going to add two buttons to the bottom



347

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.160

right of the layout, so I'll see you in



348

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.790

the next video.
