1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,630
Alright, so continuing on from the last

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,610
video at this point our projects now

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,680
been created. Now different versions of

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,360
Android studio startups showing a

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,850
different file but here we've got main

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,040
activity Kotlin file open, you can see

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,290
this here and you can also see activity

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,910
underscore main next to it up here in the

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,470
tab at the top.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,119
Now sometimes activity underscore main

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,770
will be the one initially displayed but

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,690
it doesn't really matter, so you just

13
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,130
click on the tab to switch between them

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,840
Now if you remember these are the names

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,460
that we gave to the files in that last

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,559
video or rather the names that Android

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,440
studio suggested and we accepted. Now

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
there's a lot of things to talk about on

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,410
the screen and looking at it you might

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,750
be thinking well when I start with all

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,820
of this, but the thing to keep in mind

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,890
with a lot of this is there's a lot of

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,390
information on the screen but you don't

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,980
really need to understand a lot of it

25
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,809
straight away. Now once we go through the

26
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,399
course for example, you'll understand

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,500
what layouts are and widgets and so

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,750
forth, we'll cover that in a later

29
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,460
section of the course but just keep in

30
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,020
the back of your mind that this Android

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,539
studio application is very powerful and

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,280
it doesn't able you to create very

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,280
complex applications now you don't need

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,780
to know a lot about these advanced

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,340
things yet and in fact we're not going

36
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,929
to be using some of them until later in

37
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:14,910
the course but I will be explaining

38
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,190
things as I go along so if you're keep

39
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,539
in mind that you can understand

40
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,459
everything at once then all of this will

41
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,709
make sense eventually going through some

42
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:23,910
of the fundamental things I'm going to

43
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,080
show you how to make a few little

44
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,270
changes before the next video where we

45
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,500
start running this particular

46
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,720
application so the first thing I like to

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,890
mention on this slide is that a

48
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,959
rendering error that you can get if

49
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,640
you've installed a preview version of

50
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,399
the Android SDK it's a not a good idea

51
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,170
to install a preview version when you're

52
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,910
learning because you can't be sure if

53
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,009
the error is a result of your code or a

54
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,289
bug in the SDK so here's a screenshot

55
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,179
showing an error displaying the activity

56
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:50,550
underscore main layout using the android N

57
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,039
and preview version from before Android

58
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,170
n was released. Now that doesn't look

59
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,819
good and if that's the first thing you

60
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,099
see when starting Android studio then it

61
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,560
may be a bit scary and off-putting there

62
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,229
are bugs in preview versions after all

63
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,610
if there were no bugs they'd release it

64
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,050
they wouldn't be caught a preview

65
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,450
version anymore but seeing things like

66
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,790
that when you're new to this is scary so

67
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,049
actually if you stop and think about it

68
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,299
it's obvious that the problem isn't

69
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:16,829
something that you've done because you

70
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,250
haven't entered any code yet so

71
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,380
the bug can't be yours but that doesn't

72
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,970
really help though because you still

73
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,100
don't know what to do about it so as a

74
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,290
general rule avoid preview versions

75
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,270
until you've got a lot of experience and

76
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,830
have become confident in sorting out

77
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,230
problems now it is possible that you'll

78
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,970
get a rendering error even if you're not

79
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,770
using the preview version that does

80
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,090
happen from time to time and the

81
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,920
particular error I'm thinking of is

82
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,900
similar to this that I'm showing on the

83
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,959
screen now. So if you get that the fix is

84
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,970
to go to the file menu and choose the

85
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,680
option to invalidate caches restart

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,630
alright so back in Android studio so if

87
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,070
you do see that error that I showed you

88
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,870
immediately after creating a new project

89
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,480
or opening one that was previously

90
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,640
working and just come up this far menu

91
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,670
and select invalidate case restart this

92
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,380
one here and that should actually fix

93
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,450
the problem but the good news is that

94
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,310
errors like that seem to be less common

95
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,950
in Android studio 3 however keep in mind

96
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,510
that Google changes things all the time

97
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,310
and they do sometimes introduce new bugs

98
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,950
all right so let's have a look now it's

99
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,900
what some of these other things are so

100
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,180
I'm going to start with the layout so

101
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,350
I'm going to click on the activity of a

102
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,239
schoolmate then bring the layout on the

103
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,670
screen you can see at the top there are

104
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,790
a few buttons the first one I want to

105
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,530
draw your attention to is the button

106
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,810
that lets you choose which version of

107
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,030
Android is used for the display so it's

108
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,769
the button on the left above the images

109
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,900
when you're editing a layout file and

110
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,340
the one with a picture of the Android

111
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,940
another number 26 so this one here click

112
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,340
on that, so as you can see I've got API

113
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,459
26, 25, 24 I can switch to those versions if I want to do

114
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,070
but generally I recommend you only need

115
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,290
to specify the latest released version

116
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,090
and only have that version on your

117
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,340
computer and just in case it's not

118
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,980
obvious you do need to install the SDK

119
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,390
for any version that you want to use for

120
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,400
the preview. Now the other thing is you

121
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,709
may recall when we set up the wizard it

122
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,660
asks for names and we left the layout

123
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,579
they must a default activity underscore

124
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,310
main now a layout is a file that

125
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,079
specifies how the various parts of the

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,410
screen and laid out Android studio that

127
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,300
you modify the layout either by using

128
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,340
this so graphical designer or by

129
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,440
modifying the XML that represents all

130
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,870
the objects on the screen

131
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,580
so think of a layout as a screen

132
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,949
definition and by changing the layout

133
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,960
you define what the screen looks like

134
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,840
and what it contains. Now over to the

135
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,330
left here are all the various widgets

136
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,940
that we can add to the screen so you can

137
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,310
see there's text widgets there's various

138
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,590
buttons come up here you can see there's

139
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,030
a button the toggle button or radio

140
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,100
button and there's other things also

141
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,080
like progress bars and spinners and

142
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,000
actually scrolling down you can see this

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,490
there's quite a list of different

144
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,380
widgets you can add text fuels for

145
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,540
getting inputs various containers and

146
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,540
image widgets and a whole host of other

147
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,460
things you can use when creating the

148
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,040
screens for your apps. So you can make

149
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,870
a lot of changes in this design view by

150
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,900
simply dragging widgets onto the layout

151
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,040
so for example I can come back up to

152
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,740
button and I can just come over here

153
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,720
just drag literally drag the button onto

154
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,940
the layout like so then release it we'll

155
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,139
be doing that soon so I'm just going to

156
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,380
delete that for the other you can also

157
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,960
edit the XML which is the format that

158
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,150
the file is stored in so if I come down

159
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,240
here and click on text this is the XML

160
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,840
representation of our layout now with

161
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,050
Android studio 2.2 Google set out to

162
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,880
make it possible to create even

163
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,190
complicated layouts without ever having

164
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,560
to modify the XML and they've almost

165
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,260
succeeded there's still at least one

166
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,419
reason that you need to edit the XML

167
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,950
unless you want to scrap the entire

168
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,289
layout and start again but on the whole

169
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,510
you don't have to edit this XML view to

170
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,180
get things done very often it could be a

171
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,919
quicker way to create multiple similar

172
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,050
widgets such as an array of buttons for

173
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,570
a calculator app for example but you can

174
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,700
achieve just about everything else when

175
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,020
the help without actually having to know

176
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,410
XML now if you already are familiar with

177
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,460
XML then this should look pretty

178
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,490
straightforward we can see that the

179
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,560
basic screen is just a constraint layout

180
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,780
with attributes are setting things like

181
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,870
its width and height and included in the

182
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,150
constraint layout is a textview with a

183
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,349
text set to hullo will now this can look

184
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,090
a bit complicated if you haven't seen

185
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,580
XML before, I'll switch back over here to

186
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,460
design view and when I do that you can

187
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,350
see this component tree over to the left

188
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,270
and that pretty much echoes what we saw

189
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,550
in the XML view at the top is our

190
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,130
activity underscore main layer the

191
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,800
constraint layout and contained within

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,470
the constraint layout is the textview

193
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,310
and when I'm clicking all those things

194
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,130
on the screen it gets highlighted in the

195
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,540
componentry here but it also gets

196
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,280
highlighted on the layout and if I click

197
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,870
something on the layout it gets

198
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,310
highlighted in the constraint layers as

199
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,080
well so either way will work there's

200
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,030
also a load of attributes for the things

201
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,620
we've selected over to the far right

202
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,960
over here. Now if I select the text view

203
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,090
which I've got selected you can see its

204
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,650
text property over here set to hello

205
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,020
world I can change it here so I could

206
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,470
put I was there or I was here would

207
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,080
probably be more appropriate and press

208
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,090
enter and you can see that was updated

209
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,340
here but also updated now in the

210
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,030
designer and also in the componentry now

211
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,400
the textview itself expands

212
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,160
automatically as I type more text so I

213
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,750
come back here and at today you can see

214
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,750
it's expanded to fit the text that we've

215
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,150
actually selected. So I've shown you a

216
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,130
way to update the text and we will be

217
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,960
doing that but there are other ways that

218
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,400
make it easier to make your app

219
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,860
available in other languages. Now you

220
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,480
probably wouldn't change it in a real

221
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,370
application by just over typing what

222
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,230
I've done like I did but we'll be

223
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,300
covering that later in the course but

224
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,700
that way will get us going for now now

225
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,560
there is only a selection of properly

226
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,390
showing on the screen at the moment the

227
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,890
ones that tell you'd probably want to

228
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,140
change most often but you can get access

229
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,060
to all the properties by clicking up

230
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,040
these on these double arrows here at the

231
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,720
top then this version of Android studio

232
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,090
defaults to showing the XML attributes

233
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,790
editor when you first run it so what

234
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,830
I've got here is the list that will

235
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,970
rather the attributes that we're

236
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,160
currently defined or have been defined

237
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,770
for us by the template now in previous

238
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,110
versions of Android studio all the

239
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,910
attributes appeared in an alphabetical

240
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,770
list and that makes life much easier

241
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,840
because you can scroll through and check

242
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,130
out any attributes that sound

243
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,720
interesting but with the release of

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,670
Android studio 3 that we're using here

245
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,820
that list doesn't appear straight away

246
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,900
instead we've got the attributes that

247
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,910
we've changed even if we change them

248
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,890
without being aware of it so you can see

249
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,480
things here like layout underscore width

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,540
and layout height there's also a text attribute

251
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,720
and the constraints as well which you

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,310
may not have been aware that you changed.

253
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,900
so this isn't in other words a very

254
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,270
concise view of the attributes being

255
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,670
used at the moment now if you know which

256
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,290
attributes you want to change it's also

257
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,660
very easy to set it here just type it

258
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,640
into the blank row at the bottom down

259
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,830
here so this concise view is really

260
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,390
great is great when you know what you

261
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,460
want to change but isn't very helpful

262
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,530
when you're learning about all this but

263
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,330
fortunately Google have made the

264
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,760
complete list available so you can click

265
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,850
on this cog drop-down up here and select

266
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,340
all attributes table once we do that

267
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,110
this changes to the same view that

268
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,000
earlier versions of Android studio had

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
and we can scroll right down the list

270
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,410
and see literally all the attributes we

271
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,790
can actually choose which view to use

272
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,130
here getting it more experienced you may

273
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,750
want to use the XML attribute editor

274
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,150
layout view that we had before just use

275
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,610
the same cog menu up here to change back

276
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,320
to that mode if you want to do that.

277
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,700
Now there's all sorts of things that you can

278
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,710
change here as well so let's scroll up

279
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,020
and have a look I can spare this little

280
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,420
arrow next to constraints you can see

281
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,760
that there's quite a lot of them so you

282
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,560
can make that pain wider by dragging its

283
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,430
edge over here dragged it over but if

284
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,320
you can't see the full names or if

285
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
you're short of screen space you can

286
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,950
switch off the design or blueprint modes

287
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,620
using the Select design surface but just

288
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,770
above, so you come up here and we can

289
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,780
just select for example design only to

290
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,090
give us a bit more space then move that

291
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,100
over to get a bit of good more concise

292
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,240
list of all the editors

293
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,250
attributes and we can use that button to

294
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,470
also toggle I can go back into is just

295
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,940
the blueprint different one or two as

296
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,160
well and of course we can also display

297
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,820
them both and obviously depending on the

298
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,050
amount of screen real estate we've got

299
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,580
here remaining to me things are rare to

300
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,380
see them all in their large enough size

301
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,630
to work with do each pane in Android

302
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,120
studio has a button that can be used to

303
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,130
shrink it out of the way so that you can

304
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,600
use the full space on your screen to

305
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,850
focus on what you're doing now at the

306
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,950
moment we're designing a layout and we

307
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,510
don't need to see all the files of the

308
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,550
project you'll notice that each separate

309
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,490
pane has a button that looks like a bar

310
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,720
that's just little one up here and I'll

311
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,920
just zoom in so you can see that a

312
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,690
little bit better it's got a little bar

313
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,460
with an arrow pointing left right or

314
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,440
down now clicking up

315
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,149
which order will shrink the pipe in the

316
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,949
direction of the arrow so that also

317
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:17,990
gives you an indication of where to look

318
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,029
to get it back again so if you can see

319
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,649
that now a zoom in again that's got a

320
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,750
little arrow pointing to the left if I

321
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,879
click on that you can see that paint is

322
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,129
now closed you can see the button to get

323
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,629
the paint back again in this case it's

324
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,519
the project click on that then that

325
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,500
opens it out again, so you can do the

326
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
same with the panes that open up along

327
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,529
the bottom of the Android studio window

328
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,740
down here I can click on log cat and

329
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,060
don't worry about what that means at the

330
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,399
moment but this is all about controlling

331
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,899
the individual page and you'll be seeing

332
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,329
that what they all do a little bit later

333
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:49,939
so at the far right again I can shrink

334
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:51,709
the pane and if I have a look doing that

335
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,269
up you can see that it's the arrow

336
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,360
pointing down I click on that point it

337
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,769
goes down and I can click my here to

338
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,990
click on log cat and open it again and

339
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,850
incidentally I can just click on the tab

340
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,769
if I wanna open or close it as well so

341
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,689
in other words it toggled so if I open a

342
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:06,980
block cat again and this time come over

343
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,860
here and click on event log they're both

344
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,720
next to each other, again I can just use

345
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,970
the buttons to shrink them the closing

346
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,939
down as needed, so there's a lot going on

347
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,529
in Android studio and it can look very

348
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,990
confusing but you can try which panes

349
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,579
you see and you can shrink any that

350
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:24,170
you're not interested in then it's

351
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,000
Liberty lets you focus on the work that

352
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,490
you want to doing so I've closed down

353
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,170
those two bottom panes I'm also going to

354
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,730
shrink the project pane over here again

355
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,550
so we can focus on this layout and I was

356
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,069
looking at the constraints before before

357
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,410
I started opening and closing paints now

358
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,600
these constraints look a bit confusing

359
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,550
let's expand this out a little bit so I

360
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,519
can see a little bit more but those long

361
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,139
names are intended to describe what each

362
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,480
one does so for example the first one

363
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,699
starts with bottom underscore to bottom

364
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:54,889
of which tells you that it'll be lining

365
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,990
up the bottom of the textview with

366
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,149
something then you can line the bottom

367
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,040
of our texts you up with the bottom of

368
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,959
something else which is what this first

369
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,209
constraint does but you can also line

370
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,740
the bottom of it up with the top of

371
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,750
something so that's there there's a

372
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,740
bottom to top of here for that reason as

373
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,750
well you don't want to line the bottom

374
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,189
of the textview with the top of another

375
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,589
object on the screen you also lie on the

376
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,180
left or right of a widget with the left

377
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,040
or right of another widget to position

378
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,350
things where you need them. Now lining

379
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,420
everything up in here would soon get TD

380
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,220
and there's a much easier way that I'm

381
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,240
gonna show you shortly

382
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,040
we've got a few more controls on the

383
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,839
screen. So you want to come in here

384
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,790
perhaps to check and maybe change a few

385
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,649
things though especially on a slow

386
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,999
computer or if you've only got a small

387
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:40,369
screen so for now that I don't worry too

388
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:41,899
much about what these constraints mean

389
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,519
you don't have to remember them all

390
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,019
once you've lined up a few things

391
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:46,939
they'll make a lot more sense and

392
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,139
they're gonna be coming back to this and

393
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:49,879
we will be using this lamp you a lot

394
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,499
throughout the course, so you'll get

395
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,929
plenty of practice for now I just wanted

396
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,579
to quickly show you where you'd go to

397
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,439
make changes to the lands for your apps

398
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:58,999
well that's we're gonna come over here

399
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:01,189
click on this double arrow again to go

400
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,350
back to the common properties I get some

401
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,769
screen real estate back and if you did

402
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,779
have both the design and blueprint

403
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,699
selected you can select that now and see

404
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,459
that it'll fit a little bit better.

405
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,290
Now over to the left of those buttons is one

406
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,149
that you can use to toggle the layered

407
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,649
into landscape let's just little button

408
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,869
here so we can click on that and that's

409
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:22,339
great for checking how things or look

410
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,899
when the device is rotated so I can

411
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:26,569
click on that and you can see that it's

412
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:30,139
moved the screen to landscape mode there

413
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,220
we'll be coming back to this layout

414
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,829
editor in the next video the other thing

415
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,029
that I wanted to show you though is the

416
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:37,249
project pane this is where you choose

417
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:40,069
which files you want to work on over the

418
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:43,639
project pane again and I might just grab

419
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,839
a little bit of screen real estate back

420
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,689
and the more also set this back to

421
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:49,850
portrait but over here in the project

422
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,059
pane I can expand app and expand Java as

423
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,100
I've done here and finally our package

424
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,230
shows up in this case Academy don't

425
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,899
learn programming dot HelloWorld and we

426
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,809
can then see the Kotlin files now under

427
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,579
res there's a layout folder we have a

428
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,429
look at that res layout and that's where

429
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:09,709
our layouts are stored so basically in

430
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:10,850
here are all the files that are

431
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,670
associated with the project and they'll

432
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,079
make a lot more sense as we go through

433
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,910
the course but the clever thing is that

434
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,769
Android studio is created in all this

435
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,410
forests saving a lot of time. Now the

436
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,990
common file main activity is one here

437
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,269
I've got selected that's got the card

438
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:28,790
that Android studio generated for us I went

439
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,199
through this briefly in the video and

440
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,939
templates that's his fault here if we

441
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:33,709
open it up now there's not much in this

442
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,749
one because we chose an empty activity

443
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:37,639
template but you can see that's aligned

444
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,049
here is where it uses the activity

445
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,040
underscore main layer

446
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,100
it's code along 10 so that's one way

447
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,380
that the layout files are used to create

448
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,840
the display for our apps so Android

449
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,970
studio has created the basic code for

450
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,070
our app with a layout to define the

451
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,740
screen and the code to display it when

452
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,930
we run the app that's part of the beauty

453
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,150
of Android studio it does a lot of this

454
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,880
work for us saving us a lot of time when

455
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,920
we were creating our applications so

456
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,360
that was a very quick tour of Android

457
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,220
studio and we will be looking at it in

458
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,410
much greater detail as we go through

459
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,510
this course, but before you can do much

460
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,340
experimenting though you need to be able

461
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,260
to run your app to see how the things

462
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,390
we're trying out really behave. So in the

463
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,440
next video we're going to be running

464
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,810
this app in an emulator and I'll be

465
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,160
showing you also how to set up the

466
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
emulator as well, then in the video after

467
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,970
that one I'm going to show you how it

468
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,040
runs on a physical Android device so

469
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,960
let's move on now to the next video.
