1
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:06,859
In this video, I want to show you how to

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,619
download install Android studio which is

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,090
the program we're going to be using to

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,010
write our Android applications in this

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,049
course. Now just to remind that this is

6
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,240
the windows video so if you're running a

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,460
Mac or a Linux machine there's actually

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,840
separate videos that you can follow

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,280
along with for those operating systems

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,380
but if you're using Microsoft Windows

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,210
you're in the right place so let's get

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,340
started now it's possible that you might

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,250
be running a 32-bit version of Windows

14
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,170
and if that's the case Android studio 1

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,629
HD run until you install the Java

16
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,510
development kit first now to check

17
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,039
whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,649
version the windows will come down here

19
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,280
to the Start menu and in search we're

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,690
going to type system information and

21
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,339
open up the system information you may

22
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,049
need to go into control panel depending

23
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,069
on what version of Windows you're

24
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:57,620
running and once we go in there and a

25
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,069
system summary there's system type you

26
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:04,100
can see here it says x64 based PC or

27
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,390
just assume that up so you can see that

28
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,140
now this says x64 based PC which it does

29
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,000
in my case then you've got a 64-bit

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,490
version of Windows otherwise its 32-bit

31
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,830
so because I've got a 64-bit version of

32
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,270
Windows I don't need to do anything else

33
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,910
I can proceed with the Android studio

34
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,220
installation and that's because Android

35
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,900
studio now includes its own installation

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,510
of Java but only ships with a 64-bit

37
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,370
Edition and that doesn't work on a

38
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,950
32-bit edition so if you found that by

39
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,870
doing this you've got a 32-bit system

40
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,730
showing up then stop the video here and

41
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,830
skip ahead to the next video and that's

42
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,940
going to show you how to install the

43
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,880
java jdk on your 32-bit Windows system

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
then once you follow the steps in that

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,390
video you can come back to this one and

46
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,730
continue now note that this applies even

47
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,409
if you intend programming in Kotlin

48
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,659
that's because Kotlin uses the Java

49
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,600
Virtual Machine or JVM so you still need

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,060
to have a working JDK installed on your

51
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,520
32-bit system alright so i'm gonna

52
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,440
presume that at this point you fix those

53
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,260
issues with 32 and 64-bit and what we

54
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,150
want to do now is go to the website and

55
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,640
download android studio so to do that

56
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,179
we're going to go to

57
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,200
developer.android.com then you can also

58
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,790
searched for android studio when you

59
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,609
search in an engine to find the link so

60
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:18,510
want to make sure that you are at the yet

61
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,150
Android comm site so you know that

62
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,650
you're installing the official Google

63
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,909
version you can see at the top that

64
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,830
we're on that now one thing to be aware

65
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,599
of is that the new version of Android

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,349
studio version 3.0 is very different to

67
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,239
the previous version and has a number of

68
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,950
new features that weren't available in

69
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,840
the earlier version things like the new

70
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,940
layout designer for example so you'll

71
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,580
need to be using Android studio 3.0 or

72
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,069
higher for this course now if you've

73
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,319
already got Android studio 2.3 installed

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,780
you'll still need to install the 3.0

75
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,379
version of this course in Android studio

76
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,879
2.3 will update itself in the normal way

77
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,470
so make sure if you're running that

78
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,390
version that you install the update when

79
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,190
it offers it all right so we're ready to

80
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,650
do a fresh install of Android studio 3.0

81
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,840
my windows so we're on the main page

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,250
we're gonna come over here click on get

83
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,680
Android studio we're going to click on

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,079
download Android studio I'm going to

85
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,090
click on the checkbox to agree with the

86
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,250
above terms and conditions and click on

87
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,970
download Android studio for Windows I'm

88
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,420
going to click on run here just so we

89
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,859
can see it downloading down here down

90
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,480
the bottom and we'll just pause the

91
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,980
video of what this actually downloads

92
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,989
and we'll come back continue after the

93
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,739
download is completed ok so you can see

94
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,090
the Downloads nearly finished to hell

95
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,889
once it finishes you should be able to

96
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,419
run the downloaded file from your

97
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,639
browser click it that way and it's just

98
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,590
a standard Windows installer Exe file

99
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,690
and you'll get the usual prompt asking

100
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,889
for confirmation that you're happy to

101
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,959
allow it to make changes so I'll give

102
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,430
that a moment to run the security scan

103
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,440
and we can minimize the browser now so

104
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,060
we can see what we're doing in Android

105
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,160
studio shadow you can see it's now come

106
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,290
up you may not see that on the video but

107
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,790
I'm selecting yes here to allow this app

108
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,859
to make changes to your device then we

109
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:03,299
should see the standard Android studio

110
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,239
setup start and you click Next to start

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,940
the installation and the components I'm

112
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,049
going to leave both of those on the

113
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,329
default options Android studio and the

114
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,269
Android virtual device next I'm going to

115
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,549
leave the default folder which is fine

116
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,410
for us Program Files Android Android

117
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,930
studio next click on install so that's

118
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,289
now extracting the various files so

119
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,520
we'll just fast forward this bit and

120
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,850
come back after the installation is completed

121
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,110
nobo that by the way yeah during this

122
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,449
process you may or may not get an option

123
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,639
an error coming up saying that needs to

124
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,250
retry and if that does happen just click

125
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,930
retry and that's because sometimes some

126
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,610
of these components fail installation

127
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,680
for no apparent reason and retrying it

128
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,400
should fix it

129
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,229
sometimes even retrying more than once

130
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,180
and personally I've got no idea why

131
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,400
possibly the networks a bit slower or

132
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,680
something along those lines but in our

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,940
case hopefully we won't get that to error.

134
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,740
Okay you can say the installation is

135
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,150
completed we're gonna click on next you

136
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,520
know we can leave this checkbox on to

137
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,050
start Android studio and click on finish

138
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,790
now we got this option as well to give

139
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,950
us the option to import Android studio

140
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,990
settings from another location if you've

141
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,940
got a previous installation but in our

142
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,830
case we haven't so we're going to leave

143
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,810
the default selected do not import

144
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,460
settings and click OK Android studio is

145
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,230
loading you can see now it's actually

146
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,600
finding some available SDK to components

147
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,780
and it's giving us an option now to

148
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,970
actually go ahead and install some more

149
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,230
of the Android studio setup and

150
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,310
specifically an emulator that we got next

151
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,510
then we can run it either a standard

152
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,600
install or a custom select standard that

153
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,340
should be right in most cases click on

154
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,760
next you can choose the theme which is

155
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,000
how the computer of the display will

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,930
look for you whether you would like a

157
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,180
darker background with different color

158
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,220
fonts or a white background I'm just

159
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,750
going to leave the default the choice is

160
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,110
up to you click on next we've now got a

161
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,150
list of the various application settings

162
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,700
and also the installation settings what

163
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,930
it's going to download because we've

164
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,490
only completed the first component of

165
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,590
the download we need to go through and

166
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,220
install the rest so click on finish and

167
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,660
we'll let it go here go through and

168
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,510
download and install and click on show

169
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,370
details they'll give you a bit of an

170
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,230
indication as to what it's doing and

171
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,640
this is the part where I said you may

172
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,860
come it may come up and ask you to retry

173
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,200
and potentially more than once if

174
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,150
there's a problem with Google servers do

175
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,980
that if it does come up and chances are

176
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,169
that it'll work ok but what we'll do is

177
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,880
we'll pause the video here and we'll

178
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,500
come back once this is pretty well

179
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,770
finished now the other thing I didn't

180
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,780
mention is if you have an installed

181
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,570
Android studio or any aspect of Android

182
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,250
these Android software development kit

183
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,590
it may actually prompt you for a folder

184
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,930
and SDK folder you can actually put that

185
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,280
wherever you like and the fault is

186
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,320
usually a good choice in my case because

187
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,270
I had another product that used the

188
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,610
Android SDK it didn't prompt us for that

189
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,440
if you don't get prompted the default

190
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,500
location is probably fine

191
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,570
the one thing to check once this

192
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,940
installation has completed is to make

193
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,410
sure that haxon was installed

194
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,600
successfully and that's it hexam is able

195
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,330
to be run on your computer now you may

196
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,680
see an error that it couldn't install

197
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,970
hack someone I just want to bring up a

198
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,010
slide and show you that so this might be

199
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,750
an error that you'll see and able to

200
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,120
install until hexam and if you see that

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,440
that means you won't be able to take

202
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,910
advantage of the hack some acceleration

203
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,370
features when you run your emulator and

204
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,470
in the next video when we configure the

205
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,360
SDK you'll need to install the a RM

206
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,450
emulators instead of the x86 ones you

207
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,340
know the a RM emulator will still work

208
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,950
but it'll be a lot slower than an x86

209
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,710
emulator using hexam now it may well be

210
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,990
worth checking that VTX is enabled in

211
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,000
your computer's bios so if that's the

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,530
case have a look at that in the videos

213
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,320
enable VTX in bios we've actually got a

214
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,900
video dedicated to that and one of the

215
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,880
main reasons that hexam won't work is if

216
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,190
you haven't got an intel cpu on Windows

217
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,140
the requirement for hexam to work is

218
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,810
that it has to be an Intel CPU

219
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,130
presumably because Intel have created

220
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,930
that application that made it mandatory

221
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,590
that only Intel CPUs will actually work

222
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,150
for now so if that's the only error you

223
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,220
get then Android studio and the SDK will

224
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,260
be installed and we can continue

225
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,000
so let's actually just go back now to

226
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
the live installation and see how that's

227
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,100
going all right you see that we're still

228
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,990
unzipping here we've been downloading

229
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,669
and we're unzipping so the Pring the

230
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,200
installation is still progressing so

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,789
we'll just fast-forward this and come

232
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,270
back once it's pretty much done

233
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,970
you see now it's running the Intel hexam

234
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,520
installer so this this is the part that

235
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,190
actually needs an Intel CPU so again if

236
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,360
we're getting any errors here we'll know

237
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,280
that there was a problem but in my case

238
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,450
you can see down the bottom it's got

239
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,360
Intel hexam installed successfully so

240
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,400
that means that we're good to go alright

241
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,990
so we've now installed android studio

242
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,570
successfully at this point in the next

243
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,740
video we're going to look at configuring

244
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,170
Android studio now the steps to

245
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,330
configure Android studio are largely the

246
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,490
same regardless of which operating

247
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,200
system you're using so you'll want to

248
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
skip over the next few videos now

249
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,100
because the next video is cover

250
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,440
installing Android studio on a Mac and

251
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,110
Linux and installing the java jdk on

252
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,660
32-bit systems but if you've managed to

253
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,980
install this successfully you don't need

254
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,870
to watch any of those so basically the

255
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,400
next video in that scenario that you

256
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,080
want will be the video entitled

257
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,720
configure Android SDK on all three

258
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,060
platforms so I'll see you in the next video.
