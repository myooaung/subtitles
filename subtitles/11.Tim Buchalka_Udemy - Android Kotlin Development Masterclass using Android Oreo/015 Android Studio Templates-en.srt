1
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,560
Now one thing that can confuse people

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,350
new to Android studio are the templates

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,049
that Google include with it especially

4
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:14,180
as they sometimes change them when they

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,610
release a new version. Now I try to keep

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,230
the course up to date but with new

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,880
versions of Android studio coming out

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,009
every few months there will be times

9
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,750
when it looks a little bit different to

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,970
how it appears in these videos so I'm

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,619
going to create a couple of new projects

12
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:29,269
using some of the templates that are

13
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:30,710
currently shipping with Android studio

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,900
and show off some of the ways that they

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,520
differ from each other, now remember

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,020
that these are just templates though

17
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,910
they're provided to save you having to

18
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,010
type in some of the basic code the

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,620
projects need but there's no reason or

20
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,030
you can't change any of the code that

21
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,949
the templates create if you use a

22
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:47,420
template that includes a menu for

23
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,280
example but decide that you don't want

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,989
to provide a menu in your project then

25
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:53,930
you can just delete the menu code and if

26
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,100
you've used a word processing program

27
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,160
such as Libre Office or Microsoft Word

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,379
and you may be familiar with the concept

29
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,640
of templates and these are really no

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,370
different. Alright so let's have a look

31
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,480
at the templates and we're going to

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,330
start by creating a new project now if

33
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,860
you're watching this video in the Kotlin

34
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,840
course make sure that the included

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,330
Kotlin support box is ticked that's the

36
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,640
default and probably already will be

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,920
ticked. So let's start off anyway click

38
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,680
on start a new android studio project we

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,820
can see this button that I'm talking about

40
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,010
down here include Kotlin support so

41
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,170
again that's the default it probably is

42
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,370
already clicked and if you're in the

43
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,380
Kotlin course make sure that is clicked

44
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,090
but if you're watching this video in the

45
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,970
java course you need to add tick that box

46
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,770
leaving it ticked will cause Android

47
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,180
studio to generate Kotlin

48
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,520
rather than Java code, now I've mention

49
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,110
that each time we create a new project

50
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,810
at least for the first few projects so

51
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,580
whether you generate the correct code

52
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,160
for the language you're using. Now I'm

53
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,020
going to an tick the box and that's

54
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,300
because Java programmers don't need to

55
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,340
know anything about Kotlin but Kotlin

56
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,050
programmers will need basic familiarity

57
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,220
with Java.

58
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,290
So whenever a video shows code in both

59
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,810
courses I'm going to show the Java code

60
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,370
don't worry though if we need to write

61
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,230
any code at all there'll be separate

62
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,780
videos for each course so in the Kotler

63
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,060
course, keep their box ticked then you

64
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,470
can compare the Kotlin code on your

65
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,140
screen with a java code that's going to

66
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,120
appear on mine so leave everything else

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,500
on the screen as I said for this

68
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,570
particular application of doing something a

69
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,980
little bit different and then including

70
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,770
and I've unchecked the box I'm gonna

71
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,810
click on next we leave everything I said

72
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,300
it as it is and on this next screen

73
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
we're going to leave everything else as

74
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,110
it is as well now we're going to be

75
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,490
explaining these screens in the next

76
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,080
video but for now I just want to focus

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,610
on the templates so I'm gonna click on

78
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,950
next. Now at the time I'm recording this

79
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,680
Android studio sits with 13 templates

80
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,959
and the images on this selection screen

81
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,910
try to give you an indication of what

82
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,540
they contain. Now add no activity this

83
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,400
one here is the most basic but I

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,110
generally don't use that for most apps

85
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,030
because we normally need at least one

86
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,680
activity now I'm not going to go through

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,420
describing all the templates because a

88
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,220
lot of the explanation won't make much

89
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,230
sense just yet anyway and in fact you

90
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,610
may be wondering what this activity that

91
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,870
I've just mentioned is but don't worry

92
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,270
I'll be explaining all that next now

93
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,980
once you're comfortable with Android

94
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,630
studio and you've worked through a few

95
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,430
of the apps in this course by all means

96
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,290
have a go at creating projects based on

97
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,030
each of these templates to get a feel

98
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,250
for what they provide for now the only

99
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,440
ones we really need to use are the basic

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,250
activity and the empty activity so basic

101
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,260
in empty now you can see from these

102
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,510
images that basic activity contains a

103
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,040
little bit more than the empty activity

104
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,170
template you can see the icon for the

105
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,570
drop-down menu at the top right and it

106
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,549
also has a floating action button this

107
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,580
little yellow button at the bottom right

108
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,230
so if your app will include a menu or a

109
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,180
floating action button or both then

110
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,190
you'd probably be best off starting with

111
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,140
the basic activity template but if you

112
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,549
don't want either of those then use the

113
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,489
empty activity template instead but what

114
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:53,870
if you want to menu but not a floating

115
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,579
action button well in that case you can

116
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,290
either start with an empty activity and

117
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,260
at the menu code or and this is probably

118
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,019
easier start with a basic activity and

119
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,400
delete the code for the floating action

120
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
button, so I'm going to start by choosing

121
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,540
this empty activity over here so that we

122
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,579
can see what that provides. Now on the

123
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,370
next screen as I click that I'm going to

124
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,959
leave everything as it is and accept the

125
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,940
default values, so we'll see this

126
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,769
activity name and layout name used in a

127
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,850
minute so just remember that they're

128
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,950
called main activity and activity

129
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,800
underscore main click on finish. Now

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,330
Android studio takes a little while to

131
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,520
create the project then you should end

132
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,500
up with something that will look a

133
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,080
little bit like this once this is finished

134
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,110
so I'll just fast forward this alright

135
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,070
so you should end up saying something

136
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,510
that looks a little bit similar to this

137
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,060
now the version of Android studio that

138
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,950
I'm using to record this video starts

139
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,230
off in what's called Android view after

140
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,480
creating a new project, you can see this

141
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,940
Android tab up here in the top left hand

142
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,980
corner and Android was the default mode

143
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,020
that's been selected. Now some people

144
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,690
prefer to work in project view but it

145
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,980
really doesn't matter which one you use

146
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,170
we can switch to project view by

147
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,250
clicking project and then we can expand

148
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,760
the selection of folders and expand the

149
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,070
details out of our application. Now some

150
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,660
of the other views won't show most of

151
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,280
the files we need so I would be using

152
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,740
them in this course now the app that

153
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,690
we've created is called my application

154
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,460
what's actually called my application -

155
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,470
and that's because I already created one

156
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,570
previously called my application and I

157
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,070
expanded that view and you saw that we

158
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,410
saw there was this app folder expand

159
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,750
that click that open and this is where

160
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,250
most of the files were interested in

161
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,620
they're located now in Android view you

162
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,160
switch back to that the app folder was

163
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,690
at the top level this one here and I can

164
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,970
expand that out and this is why many

165
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,220
people prefer to work in that view more

166
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,470
files are visible in project for you but

167
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,790
most of them are the ones that you don't

168
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,860
generally need to worry about the main

169
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,840
files we have to change or create are in

170
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,590
this Java or res folders or it's just

171
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,680
back to project view we can expand that

172
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,460
out we've still got the source main

173
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,020
we've got the Java and res folders here

174
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,360
they're just a little bit in a slightly

175
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,130
different location when in project view

176
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,979
compared to Android view that's the same

177
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,660
set of files essentially just presented

178
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,610
in a different way so choose whichever

179
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,930
view you're most comfortable with

180
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,570
I'll be mainly using the Android view in

181
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,340
this course now over on the right-hand

182
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,729
pane up here there's two files open

183
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,080
activity underscore maintain XML and

184
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,729
mainactivity.java.

185
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,740
Now these are the names of the activity

186
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,530
in the layout from the earlier screen

187
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,479
now if we close these we can open them

188
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,030
up we're just opening the particular

189
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,430
folder in the case of the Java folder we

190
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,930
can double click main activity to open

191
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,669
them up and the activity in the school

192
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:42,229
made you can look at the layout folder

193
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,510
and double click that and open it up like that

194
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,550
and again going back to Android view

195
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,740
you can see essentially the same thing

196
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,070
opening up we can see that main activity

197
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,420
file was there that in the res folder

198
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,310
and the layout folder there's our

199
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,220
activity_main.xml. Now the

200
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,020
activity_main.xml

201
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,420
defines what the screen for the activity

202
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,550
will look like and if I go into this

203
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,950
design tab which is selected currently

204
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,720
anyway you can see that it looks very

205
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,870
similar to the template image there's no

206
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,850
menu icon showing a no failing action

207
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,710
buttons just a text hello world as you

208
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,710
can see there. Now main activity also it

209
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,330
doesn't contain very much we have a look

210
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,710
at that don't worry about what any of

211
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,510
this code means at the moment I'm just

212
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,980
showing you what the templates look like

213
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,510
so you don't get stuck when Google

214
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,640
changes them again in the future and

215
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,320
also don't worry that this is Java code

216
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,640
if you're watching this in the Kotlin

217
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,530
version of the course anything we do

218
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,940
with the screen layouts is the same

219
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,970
regardless of the language used, so some

220
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,230
of the videos have the same for both

221
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,270
courses. Now we can see that we've got a

222
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,400
class here called main activity and

223
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,080
that's got a single method called on

224
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,200
create, a class named method named make

225
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,700
a mental note of that and then we'll see

226
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,440
how the next template differs, so what

227
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,030
I'm going to do now though is in the

228
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,980
video and in the next video, we'll go

229
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,840
ahead and we'll create a second project

230
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,540
this time based on the basic activity

231
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,670
template. So I'll see you in the next video.
