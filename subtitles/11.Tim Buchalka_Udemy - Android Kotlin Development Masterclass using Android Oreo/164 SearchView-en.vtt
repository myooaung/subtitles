00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.820

In the last video, we added the search menu item. Now clicking it won't do anything yet. The main reason for that is



2

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.700

we've got an error now in MainActivity, in the onOptionsItemSelected, because we've removed the settings



3

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.410

menu option.



4

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.210

So it's time to get that working now.



5

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.210

So what we want to do is launch the searchActivity activity. Now we've seen how to start a new activity



6

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.710

using an intent, a few times now.



7

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.200

So this is going to be very similar to starting our PhotDetailsActivity when a thumbnail's tapped.



8

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.980

So the place to do it, again, is in this onOptionsItemSelected in MainActivity, and the change,



9

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.030

firstly, we're going to remove the action underscore settings because we deleted that menu option.



10

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.180

We're going to replace that with action



11

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.970

underscore search, which is our new one, delete true, add a code block, and the code block is going to be start



12

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.870

Activity parentheses Intent with a capital I,



13

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.510

then parentheses again, this comma.



14

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.360

Then it's going to be searchActivity colon colon class dot Java.



15

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.450

That's the first one,



16

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.170

and the second line is going to be true.



17

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.180

So although we haven't done very much, and it's just basically launching of an activity like we've done



18

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.960

before,



19

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.660

it's still a good idea to run the app before going any further.



20

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.550

So let's actually try doing that, making sure that the app compiles and runs.



21

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.280

OK, so



22

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.630

there's our app, and we've now got the little magnifying glass here, the search icon



23

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.360

so we click on that, we can see that searchActivity actually works. But of course, it's not going to do anything



24

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.910

yet.



25

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.250

But if we know that it launches OK, then any errors we get later will be caused by changes in search



26

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.000

Activity,



27

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.860

so that narrows down where we have to look for them.



28

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.670

So that's why it's always a good idea to be making, or testing your changes as you go along.



29

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.680

Alright, so we've got the search icon working, so that's good.



30

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.550

So it's now time to make our searchActivity do something useful.



31

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.650

Now it turns out there's actually not much we need to do, because the search view widget does most of it for



32

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.250

us. Now we need to create a new menu,



33

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.450

so I'm going to come over here to our res folder. I'm going to open that up, the res Menu folder,



34

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.240

right click, select New, Menu resource file.



35

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.000

I'm going to call this one menu_search and click OK.



36

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.430

We don't change anything else.



37

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.390

Now it's just going to contain a single item which would be where we enter the search terms.



38

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.390

So what we're going to do here, is use the toolbar to host a search view widget, so that we can search



39

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.580

for things by typing them into the toolbar.



40

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.000

And that's a very common way to implement search in Android.



41

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.820

So it'll pretty much look as you'd expect it to.



42

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.120

So I'm going to come over here and grab, and drag rather, a search item onto the menu, and obviously search



43

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.610

item rather than menu item, so we're going to just do that and release, and obviously I could've dragged it into the component tree,



44

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.840

if I wanted to do that instead.



45

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.530

Alright so that's created the search view for us, you can see over here that as well. The ID has been set to



46

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.940

app underscore bar underscore search.



47

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.600

So I'm just going to leave it at that.



48

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.120

Now I have noticed that the common attributes pane doesn't always populate, and you can see there that



49

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.160

I've clicked on that and nothing's happening.



50

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.690

If that appears blank for you, just expand the attributes pane and that should show all the attributes.



51

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.720

So I'll come over here and do that, and you can see that that's actually working now.



52

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.110

And if it comes up with a different ID for you, either change it to be the same as mine, or just use the



53

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.150

ID you've got when you type the code in later. And again, if I go back we can't see anything else, but you can see by



54

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.190

the extended view we can see that it's working.



55

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.450

Now we've got an error though, or I have and you may not have.



56

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.310

If we come over here, and I've already expanded menu but you can see over here, we've got a warning or an error over



57

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.930

here.



58

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.700

And if you click on this exclamation mark,



59

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.030

the error's saying that we should be using the app colon namespace with the appCompat library, and it's actually



60

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.220

a slightly strange error.



61

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.260

So if we scroll up a little bit more,



62

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.090

it's actually got a button here, a fix, that'll change to use the app colon namespace.



63

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.400

Now if Android Studio can spot the error and fix it for us, then it may fix it automatically in future.



64

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.890

So if you don't get this particular error that's fine. There's no point worrying when you don't get an error.



65

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.150

Save your worrying for when you do get them.



66

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.110

Alright so I'm going to click on this fix button, and you can see that we've actually got a message



67

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.200

here about hardcoded text, but the other message has disappeared,



68

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.580

so that's good.



69

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.900

Now what we should probably do is make a point of clearing or fixing this hardcoded text warning



70

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.660

as well. So I'm going to close this for now,



71

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.360

and as I showed you earlier,



72

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.800

for my version of Android Studio the common attributes aren't showing, and so therefore I'm having to click



73

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.950

on the extended attributes to get in there and be able to change anything.



74

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.320

And what we want to do is to make some changes here.



75

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.150

So we've already got our string resource for search,



76

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:13.020

so we're going to go over next to title, over here, and click on the ellipsis. Then we want to choose activity



77

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.900

underscore search, so I've got title underscore activity underscore search.



78

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.610

Click on OK,



79

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.930

and you can see that it's now cleared the error. Now the last attribute is set to, to set is showAsAction.



80

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.250

So we want to set that to



81

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:38.580

ifRoom, so this one down here, showAsAction. We're going to come over here, expand this out, and click on ifRoom. Alright so at this



82

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.350

point we've got our menu created.



83

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.190

Now we need to tell search activity to display it and provide the search functionality that we need.



84

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.100

So I'm going to go through the easy stuff first,



85

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.470

and then we can have a look at how search is implemented, and the changes we have to make to get it to



86

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.980

work.



87

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.220

So the first thing we need though, is to declare a search view variable in search activity. So I'm going to come over and



88

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.190

open that up.



89

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.170

SearchActivity.



90

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.680

Let's go back under the tag definition and add a search view, so it's going to be private var



91

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.170

search view colon SearchView



92

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.840

question mark



93

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.010

equals null, and we're going to select,



94

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.300

now you might be asking which one to select here.



95

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.720

Well we're using the framework search view rather than the support version,



96

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.050

and that's because SearchView was added in API 11.



97

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.400

Now our minimum API is 17,



98

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.940

so therefore we don't need to use the support library for this. Now as Android Studio



99

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.820

doesn't now support API levels earlier than 14,



100

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.370

it's even strange that it's offering the support library version. It's something to be aware of though and watch out



101

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.010

for.



102

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.750

So I'm going to select the main version android.widget.SearchView. Now the next step is to inflate



103

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.880

menu in the onCreateOptions menu function, which we'll add after the on create function.



104

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.590

So I'm going to come down here, then I'm going to do a control o to generate the stub, and again, the one we want we want is



105

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:14.480

onCreateOptions. I'm just typing a bit of that in, that one there, onCreateOptionsMenu is the one we want so I'm just going



106

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.160

to press enter there.



107

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.360

And we're going to delete the call to super,



108

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:28.950

and instead what we're going to do is type menu inflator dot inflate parentheses R.menu dot



109

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.460

menu underscore search, which we created,



110

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.820

comma menu closing parentheses.



111

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.620

And then we're going to return true.



112

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.190

So that's standard code in the onCreateOptionsMenu function, and it's the same as we did in MainActivity,



113

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:49.220

except of course this time we're inflating menu underscore search instead of menu underscore main. Now



114

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:55.280

inflating an XML layout, just takes the XML representation of all the widgets and menu items and



115

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.180

so forth, and creates the view for them, or from them.



116

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.490

Now here we're using a menu inflater rather than a layout inflater, because we're actually creating



117

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.850

a menu, or inflating a menu, rather than a layout.



118

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.830

Alright so that's the easy bits out of the way.



119

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.340

Now it gets interesting.



120

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:17.570

Now the steps we have to do at this point are well documented, and a good source is a Google training document



121

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.800

that I'm going to open up in my browser now, and add as a resource as I always do,



122

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.080

so you can check it out at your leisure. Now this particular page doesn't mention that you have to use



123

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.290

the app colon namespace,



124

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.920

if you're using AppCompat, but the rest of the document is accurate. Now we've actually done the first



125

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.980

steps on this page.



126

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.820

We've added the search view to the app bar,



127

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:48.800

so what we need now to do is create a Searchable Configuration, and that's all described on that heading.



128

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.080

So if we scroll down here, create a Searchable configuration,



129

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.580

and we're going to be coming back to this page to get the meta data for the manifests.



130

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:03.660

Now we're going to create a very basic configuration file, but if we follow the Searchable Configuration



131

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.370

link at the top of that section of the page, there's a lot of configuration possibilities, so Searchable



132

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.490

Configuration here.



133

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:19.680

So you can see there's quite a few options that we can define. Now we're going to provide a label because that's



134

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.820

required,



135

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.890

and we can come down to any of these and see whether they're required or not.



136

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.830

You can see here String resource required, and we're also going to provide a hint, which if we scroll down and have



137

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.790

a look there, the hint



138

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.540

that's actually recommended.



139

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.700

Everything else is optional and lets you provide lots of things including, for example, voice search.



140

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:43.190

Now we're going to keep things simple for this first example of using search in our apps.



141

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.930

So our Searchable Configuration file will only contain the label and the hint.



142

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:53.230

Now the Searchable Configuration file is usually called searchable dot xml, although frankly



143

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:58.360

you can call it any valid name you want, which you may need to do if your app implements several different



144

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.640

search features.



145

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:04.060

Now the file that you create must live in the res slash xml directory,



146

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.910

so therefore we need to create that xml directory.



147

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.260

So going back to Android Studio,



148

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.650

we'll go into the res folder,



149

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:18.610

and from the res folder we're going to create a new folder. We're going to right click New, Android resource directory. So



150

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:25.600

we're going to change it so that the name will change from values to xml, and the Resource type, we'll also change that



151

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.170

so that's also xml. Everything else is fine to leave as the default



152

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.350

so just click on OK.



153

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:37.820

So at this point we've now got an xml folder down here. So we want to right click on that folder now, and click



154

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.540

on New, XML resource file.



155

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.710

Now we don't need to specify anything other than the file name,



156

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.170

so we can just type in searchable here.



157

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.990

Click OK,



158

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:56.250

and the xml extension will be provided automatically by Android Studio, and we can confirm that by



159

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.690

opening up the directory there and you can see that showing up.



160

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.960

The other thing that is different though, is that Android Studio's automatically opened up searchable dot



161

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.330

xml in the new preferences editor.



162

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.830

Now this was new to Android Studio 2.2, and it lets you create a settings screen for your app settings.



163

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.900

Now that's great if you're trying to create a settings screen, but less useful if you're creating what



164

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.590

we're doing, a searchable configuration file.



165

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.030

Now there is a way to prevent it from launching straight into this preferences editor



166

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.400

when you create a new xml file, but frankly it's not really worth the trouble, because all you really



167

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.860

have to do is come over here and click on text to get into a normal editor, where you can edit the xml



168

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.560

directly. Now notice that



169

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.620

it also creates the xml declaration for us.



170

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.680

That's that first line, line 1, and that saves a little bit of typing.



171

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.320

So what I'm going to do is replace the preferences screen tags with the searchable tag that we need.



172

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:55.710

So literally I'm just going to come up here and change that to searchable, press enter there. I'm going to come over to the



173

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.720

end of this first line for Android.



174

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:07.980

I'm going to add to that, android colon hint equals Enter photo tags, and on the next line, tab over so that



175

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:16.800

it's nicely in line, so android label equals. Then we're going to print double quotes @string forward slash



176

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.150

title_ activity_search,



177

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:27.970

and I'm just going to close it off there, and just delete the closing tag there now that we've done that. Now for the hint,



178

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.570

I going to show you an alternate way of doing things.



179

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:35.640

As I've actually entered the actual text that I want, what you can do with your cursor in that field,



180

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.610

is you can hold down alt and press enter,



181

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:47.130

and it brings up a little menu here. We can select Extract string resource, and that actually lets you create, or convert



182

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.260

rather, the text to a string resource.



183

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:55.230

Now I'm going to use the name searchable_hint for the resource name.



184

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:01.680

Now note that the resource value is already set to whatever text you typed in the double quotes there. So if you just



185

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:08.560

click on OK now, you can see that the text is now stored in a string resource instead of being hardcoded.



186

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.580

Alright so let's finish the video here.



187

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.600

We'll continue on working on the changes to implement search in the next video.
