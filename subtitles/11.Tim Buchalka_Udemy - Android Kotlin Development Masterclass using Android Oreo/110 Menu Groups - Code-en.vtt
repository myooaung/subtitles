00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.020

all right so we added two more menu



2

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.210

items in the last video now we need to



3

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.980

write the code to make these menu items



4

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.470

work so we're gonna go back to main



5

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.570

activity so I'm going to close down this



6

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.070

design the feed zone is called menu dot



7

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.210

XML I'm go to our main activity being



8

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.220

done on the screen and we need to add



9

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.189

the new items in the on options items



10

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.930

selected function this one here now this



11

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.420

takes a bit of thought because these two



12

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.950

options are going to keep most of the



13

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.809

gyro and changed



14

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.480

they just alter the limit parameter so



15

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.890

that means we have to store the base



16

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.980

part of the URL as a class variable



17

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.199

rather than a private variable now at



18

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.739

the moment we've got to feed URL private



19

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.750

in the on options item selected method



20

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.179

so we need to move it into the class so



21

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.710

that we can use its value from one call



22

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.809

to the next as different limits are



23

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.640

chosen and we also need to store the



24

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.289

current limit size I'm going to add two



25

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.539

variables to the top of the class so



26

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.760

what I'm going to do also is just take a



27

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.200

copy of that figure oh well actually



28

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.820

I'll cut it out of there go back up to



29

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.210

the top of the class and just below the



30

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.310

tag you're going to put the code in



31

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540

there place your put this up a little



32

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.900

bit



33

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.630

I'll put it below the download data so



34

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.860

instead of just bad now that's gonna be



35

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.860

private



36

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.240

it's of going to be a their equals R



37

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.520

we're going to get the default value in



38

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.250

a minute then on the next line we need



39

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.630

to add this feed limit so I'm gonna set



40

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.120

that to private VAR feed limit equals 10



41

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.080

all right so then we're going to take a



42

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.380

copy of this line or top three



43

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.210

applications I'm going to just copy that



44

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.170

let's paste it in our feed URL but



45

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.810

instead of our where it's got 10 it'll



46

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.060

change that to percent d that's a



47

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.120

lowercase D now this is a way of



48

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.099

specifying an integer value that's going



49

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.619

to be replaced by an actual value using



50

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.870

a string to format function now the



51

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.520

string that format function takes a



52

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.440

string containing special format codes



53

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.130

like the said D and then



54

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.510

number of valleys that are used to



55

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.000

replace the format codes you can do the



56

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.320

same thing by concatenating strings



57

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.260

using plus but this is a bit neater or



58

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.020

and to avoid duplicating the irrelevant



59

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.720

to change the oncreate code so that it



60

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.000

uses these two fields to create the URL



61

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.670

that's downloaded initially so to do



62

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.650

that we're going to come into uncreate



63

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.670

method we're going to change the



64

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.070

download to URL method call I'm going to



65

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.910

delete out that hard-coded feed URL and



66

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.740

we had to replace that with feed URL dr.



67

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.750

formats feeding it so that now uses the



68

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.430

string dot format method to replace the



69

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.950

percent D in the feed URL which we added



70

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.680

on line 37 with the current value of



71

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.080

feed limit the other thing we're going



72

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.180

to do is with our own options item



73

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.690

created we also want to fix that there



74

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.010

as well so let's do the same thing there



75

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.820

I'm going to take a copy of that I don't



76

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.260

line that download your online I'm down



77

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.790

here we're going to replace it there the



78

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.050

other thing we need to do is we need to



79

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.900

replace the percent D in three places in



80

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.150

our own options item selected so let's



81

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:44.860

do that simply % D and % t all right so



82

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.230

that's done and all we have to do now is



83

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.900

change the value of feed limit when one



84

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.240

of the two menu options is chosen so to



85

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.770

do that we need another branch in our



86

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.930

win expression so let's go ahead and do



87

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.850

that we're going to put this before the



88

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.510

else so down here and what we go to the



89

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.050

top is r dot ID dot mnu 10 comma r dot



90

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.360

ID dot mnu 25 the arrow token will open



91

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.820

a code block and then we're going to put



92

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.680

our logic in here did inform whether to



93

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.760

select 25 or 10 or do that by putting if



94

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.990

not item that is checked not is



95

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.830

checkable what is checked



96

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.850

then we put item is checked equals true



97

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.170

so it's not checked we're setting it



98

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.820

equal to checked in other words we're



99

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.370

setting it to true to do that and we're



100

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.260

going to put feed limit equals 35 take



101

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.410

feeling there we go door locks I log dot



102

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.240

d parentheses tag comma double quotes on



103

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:00.900

options item selected for a Col on there



104

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.200

space dollar sign left to right curly



105

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.070

braces item title and that side of the



106

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.700

curly brace is sitting feed limit to



107

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.900

dollar feed limit then we'll put an else



108

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.480

there let's just copy that line to set a



109

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.520

bit of time then this term will be on



110

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.100

options item selected item feed limit



111

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.800

and because it's an else there wasn't



112

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.090

any change so we're going to just put



113

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.050

the text unchanged so we want to perform



114

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.540

pretty much the same actions which your



115

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.430

ever the two options is selected the



116

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.810

only difference here is that the new



117

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.440

Valley is so on to feed limit and you



118

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.700

can see here that there's a neat little



119

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.680

way to toggle between two different



120

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.110

numerical values and that's just to



121

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.330

subtract the current value from the sum



122

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.300

of the two so in other words 35 minus 25



123

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.220

kids 10 and 35 minus 10 gives 25 and



124

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.320

that's how the limit changed here now if



125

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.850

an item was already checked then we



126

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.440

don't need to do anything that's this



127

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.540

test here I'll online 72



128

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.070

well actually what we're doing is we're



129

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.470

making sure that it's not checked so if



130

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.490

it's already checked we're going to



131

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.290

ignore that and then the else code will



132

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.080

be handled and then we'll actually he



133

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.760

goes through and just logs him output to



134

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.170

say that this setting of free limit was



135

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.720

unchanged otherwise if the radio button



136

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.510

was select wasn't already selected or



137

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.460

checked in other words we're actually



138

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.440

checking it and they were updating free



139

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.640

limit and then we're logging that out



140

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.310

output as well now the way these radio



141

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.840

groups work isn't immediately obvious



142

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.810

but it's actually quite clever the menu



143

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.730

items are checked or unchecked by the



144

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.210

menus



145

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.220

and when he clicked them you have to do



146

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.650

that yourself in code so if either one



147

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.150

of those options is selected from the



148

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.699

menu then we test the item to see if it



149

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.280

was already selected if it was we don't



150

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.750

need to do anything else or they'll



151

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.729

block the fact as you can see with the



152

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.160

else on line 77 so that we can see



153

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.300

what's happening by checking the logcat



154

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.210

but if the item wasn't checked then



155

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.280

we're setting it to checked now the menu



156

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.750

system does help here and will



157

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.300

automatically uncheck any other members



158

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.280

of the same group for us and that's



159

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.990

handy because we only get a reference to



160

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.599

the one item passed into the method and



161

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.550

incidentally that's point android passes



162

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.340

in the item reference rather than just



163

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.039

its ID so we have an item to manipulate



164

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:24.539

when we need to like we're doing here



165

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.729

now if you want to you can find out more



166

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.400

information about menu option groups in



167

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.860

the documentation let me just bring that



168

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:39.810

up on the screen now this guide



169

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.120

on-screen actually covers quite a lot



170

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.220

about using menus in general the bit



171

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.620

that's specific about groups is pretty



172

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.729

well towards the bottom about



173

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:49.979

four-fifths of the way down there's a



174

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:51.120

section that should be there called



175

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.070

something along the lines of using



176

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.830

checkable menu items



177

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.880

see the code they are using checkable



178

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.070

menu items alright so check that out if



179

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.170

you want to find out more information



180

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.780

all right so let's go back to our app so



181

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.070

essentially the app should toggle



182

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.800

between showing the top 10 and top 25



183

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.840

now that we've introduced this code so



184

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.220

let's actually run it and see what



185

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:23.250

happens oh it starts off showing the top



186

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.160

10 and what we can do is we'll just



187

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.450

scroll down and just confirm that is the



188

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.530

top 10 we can in google.maps to be the



189

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.090

last one there and if you change this



190

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.650

now to top 25 and they haven't unlocked



191

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.669

my scrolling down clearly there's more



192

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.229

applications showing there so that's



193

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.060

good that the top 25 is now running as



194

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.450

well



195

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.490

and we can also if we want to confirm



196

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.220

that and have a look at logcat and



197

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.990

confirm that the change did actually



198

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.460

occur and we can see the data being



199

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.090

downloaded there to scroll up above that



200

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:04.260

top 25 setting feed limit to 25 and to



201

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.670

make it easier we can filter on main



202

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.960

activity let's do that main activity as



203

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.520

they can see now on options are selected



204

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.340

top 25 was selected and feed limit was



205

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.250

set to 25 and just to confirm if we go



206

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.650

back and set it to top 25 again you can



207

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.510

see this time top 25 setting free limit



208

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.190

unchanged so it's logging the fact that



209

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.740

the limit wasn't changed but there is a



210

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.900

problem though and that's that it



211

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.640

downloads the data again even though



212

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.740

nothing's changed and we can see that



213

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.440

here the fact that it started the async



214

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.740

task now that's a good way to drain the



215

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.930

device battery or incur roaming data



216

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.360

charges so we really should do something



217

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.820

about that now by thinking back to the



218

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.190

activity life cycle you should be able



219

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.290

to work out what will happen when I



220

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.720

rotate the device into landscape what



221

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.080

I'm going to do is just clear the logcat



222

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.550

so that we can see the log entries from



223

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.610

download data and past applications I'm



224

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.720

going to remove the filter to main



225

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.120

activity I shall clear the log count



226

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.920

again now that I've done that let's go



227

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.260

and open up the app or bring them back



228

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.010

onto the screen



229

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.500

let's rotate that and see what happens



230

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.700

so what I do that you can see from the



231

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.740

logcat here that it downloads the data



232

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.140

again and that's because the activity is



233

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:27.480

destroyed and recreated but also if we



234

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.510

come over here and check out the code



235

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.370

you can see what's happened here is that



236

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.220

it set the limit back to 10



237

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.520

rather than 25 enough again because the



238

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.140

activities got destroyed and recreated



239

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.080

but we know how to fix that by storing



240

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.880

the value in the instance state bundle



241

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.040

is in the unsafe instance state to



242

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.160

function you know ideally the code



243

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.040

should store the last used URL and only



244

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.720

download the data again if the URL was



245

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.660

actually changed if we do that we need



246

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.400

to provide some way for the user to



247

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.770

refresh the data manually but at least



248

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.240

then they'd be able to make a conscious



249

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.730

decision to use their mobile data or use



250

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.500

up some of their battery life rather



251

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.470

than our app just doing it anyway



252

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.610

unfortunately those saving something as



253

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.860

complex as an adapter isn't as



254

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.330

straightforward as just storing it in



255

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.490

the instance state bundle and that



256

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.750

probably wouldn't be the best approach



257

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.180

anyway if we wanted to save performing a



258

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.590

download when the device orientation



259

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.170

changed it's probably better to cache



260

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.180

the downloaded data in the same way that



261

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.240

web browsers do so that way you can



262

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.280

allow your activity to be destroyed and



263

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.920

recreated when the device is rotated and



264

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.020

the redownload he would read the data



265

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.210

from the local cache instead of over the



266

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.610

internet now that's a bit much for only



267

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.440

the third up in the course so this app



268

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.850

is just going to download the data again



269

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.940

when the device is rotated but if you do



270

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.380

want to learn more about caching



271

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.810

downloads there's a pretty decent Google



272

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.310

article which I'm just going to bring up



273

00:11:54.310 --> 00:12:00.200

on the screen to check out



274

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.510

and basically we can prevent redundant



275

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.910

downloads when men when menu items are



276

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.130

click though and can also make sure that



277

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.019

the correct a URL and feed limit are



278

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:11.959

used when the device is rotated so that



279

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:14.870

sounds like a good challenge now one



280

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.010

problem you'll have that I haven't



281

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.680

covered is how to set the current menu



282

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.079

limit once we restored the feed limit



283

00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:24.050

value now the place to do that is in the



284

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.660

oncreate options menu method now the



285

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.339

approach is very similar to working with



286

00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:30.500

widgets in a layout but here we're



287

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.480

working with items in a menu



288

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.410

so let's actually have a look at that so



289

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.930

uncreate options menu we've got the menu



290

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.209

not flightline and what we want to do



291

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:44.000

after that is put in some code that says



292

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.779

if feed limit is equal to 10 then we're



293

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:55.970

going to do a menu question mark for an



294

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:02.360

item I don't I do a menu 10 question



295

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.730

mark outside of the parentheses dot is



296

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.300

checked is equal to true I'm going to



297

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.860

add an else otherwise and the else is



298

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.740

going to be basically very similar but



299

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.110

it's going to be the art the a menu 25



300

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.019

so the top 25 button so they also be



301

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:19.880

menu question mark dot file item



302

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.769

parentheses are don't ID dot a menu 25



303

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:25.820

in question like outside of the



304

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.420

parentheses dot is checked equals true



305

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.380

and then we're just going to return true



306

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.140

as it was before so we used the menu dot



307

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.730

final item method then set the is



308

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.980

checked property to check either the a



309

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.279

menu 10 or any new 25 item depending on



310

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.709

the value of the limit now notice that



311

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:44.480

we're using the safe call operator a lot



312

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.690

here menu was a nullable type so we have



313

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.209

to use safe call when calling it's find



314

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:52.490

item method and we also use it before



315

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.310

accessing the is checked property now



316

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.389

you might be wondering why I didn't just



317

00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:59.360

change the function signature after all



318

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.529

I've been doing so with a parent



319

00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:03.230

appeared and happen till now well as I



320

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.639

said you need to think very carefully



321

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:07.910

before doing that now in here we can't



322

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.380

be certain that we can't do it



323

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.970

so our app could use one of the no



324

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.319

action bar themes which means it



325

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:13.000

wouldn't have



326

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.210

you so in that case menu would be null



327

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.920

now it's likely that on create options



328

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.590

menu won't be called in that case you'd



329

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.910

have to examine the android framework



330

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.340

code to be sure which would take some



331

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.950

time so it's easier just to use safe



332

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.680

calls at least in this scenario if in



333

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.660

doubt don't modify the framework



334

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.420

signatures now of course if Google Ad



335

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.540

and a non null annotation then you'll



336

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.070

know that so we could have changed it



337

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.230

when that happens the code generator



338

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.760

will generate the method without using a



339

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.700

nullable type alright so with that



340

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.080

change you should now be able to have a



341

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.880

go with the challenge so here's the



342

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.970

challenge so you want to modify the app



343

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.860

so that doesn't download data from the



344

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.100

same URL a second time unless the user



345

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.200

specifically chooses to refresh the data



346

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.960

now you also store the current URL and



347

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.330

limit so that they aren't reset when the



348

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.970

device orientation changes the data will



349

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.530

still be downloaded again following a



350

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.330

change in orientation but it should



351

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.940

download from the same URL that the user



352

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.070

was looking at before they rotated the



353

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.860

device so to be clear the only three



354

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.810

events that should cause data to be



355

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.240

downloaded firstly a change in



356

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.880

orientation secondly selecting a



357

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.730

different URL or limit from the menu so



358

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.650

if the same menu of limit is sector from



359

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.839

the menu a second time data wouldn't be



360

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.880

downloaded and thirdly if the user



361

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.339

chooses to refresh the feed with the



362

00:15:36.339 --> 00:15:37.960

refresh menu option that you're going to
