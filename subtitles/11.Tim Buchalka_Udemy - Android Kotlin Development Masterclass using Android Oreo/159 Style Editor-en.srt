1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,350
Alright, so there's one other thing that I want to quickly show you before we start experimenting further,

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,610
and that's the Theme Editor. Now at the top right of the window, when you're editing a file containing style

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,260
tags,

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,540
is this link to Open editor.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,980
So I'm going to click on that.

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,580
Now the reason I'm not going to spend long on this is because frankly, it's rubbish.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,170
You'd be much better off, or are much better off editing the small amount of xml that you have to

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,180
deal with, to create styles rather than using this editor.

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,200
But with that said let's have a look anyway.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,960
So it starts off by displaying the AppTheme style, and you can see that in the Theme dropdown at top right over here.

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,960
Now we haven't changed AppTheme for the various API levels, but we have changed the AppTheme dot NoAction

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,450
Bar.

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,740
So I'm going to select that style, using that dropdown over here, AppTheme.NoActionBar.

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,640
Now we can see the various parts of the display and how they've been styled.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,460
That's pretty cool,

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,050
and that may be the best use for this theme editor.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,180
In fact, the term theme viewer might be a better use for it.

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,840
Now over at the top left, we can see how the toolbar's been styled, and you see that it's in

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,730
teal at the moment.

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,920
And it also shows how buttons will appear as well. Now as of the time I'm recording this video, it's not

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,330
doing a great job of rendering the fab button, down here, very well.

22
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:28,400
You can see that it's showing a grey square and we know, of course, that the fab appears in deep orange.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,250
So there are a few little bugs with this.

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,200
And another thing that you'll probably notice is that the main display doesn't always update straight

25
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,560
away. Once you scroll the main screen, though,

26
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:45,020
generally, everything does fix itself up and gets updated. OK so we've got API 27 showing up here in the drop

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,030
down at the top.

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,270
So as of the time I'm recording, API 27 is the latest version, but Google are yet to release all the information

29
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,010
about that, including the source code etcetera.

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,350
Alright, so over here we've got API 27 showing in the dropdown at the top, and over on the right hand side, you can

31
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,860
see down here in various places, it shows API 26 for many of the attributes.

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,460
Now normally that will be the same number,

33
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,680
so if it's 27 here, it'll be API 27 here,

34
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,120
but because API 27 is in transition as of the time of I'm recording this video, that's why we're seeing a

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,370
discrepancy there.

36
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,910
But note that it's also showing API 23 for some of these attributes.

37
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,250
And those are the attributes that we've specified in the v23 style sheet, so navigation bar color

38
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,950
being one example of that.

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,800
You see that it's sharing API 23 over here to the right.

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:45,220
Now we can change, either using the dropdown at the top over here, or the one next to each particular attribute.

41
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:53,000
So what I'm going to do is start with the top one up here, and change this to API 17, and you will notice that it

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,170
seems to take a while to update the screen sometimes, and if I come back up here to my mouse,

43
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,130
notice how just doing that changed it to 17.

44
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,900
So it seems to be a bit buggy at the moment, but note that when I did do that, now that the navigation bar

45
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,530
down here is now showing in black rather than dark teal.

46
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,840
So it knows that our theme doesn't style the navigation bar on API levels below 21, then the display obviously

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,150
reflects that.

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,830
Now the API levels on the right

49
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,960
may well go up to, may be a bit strange as well.

50
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,600
So color primary, if we have a look at that up here,

51
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,850
may be showing API 23 and it is in my particular case.

52
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,870
So it's quite good,

53
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:33,770
this Theme Editor, for showing you which parts of the display you've set to various colours, and you can

54
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:39,860
drop down different API levels to the right hand side over here, to see which value you've specified or defined

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,050
at the various API Android levels.

56
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,960
Now I say quite good.

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,890
When I first did this it was showing a switch colour as a light hue, up here.

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,590
So it was showing that, rather than the orange accent color we're actually using.

59
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,990
So it's certainly not perfect.

60
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,600
Now if you want to change a colour, click on the image of the colour

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,930
with the folded up corner.

62
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,660
This is these ones over here,

63
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,600
and we'll get a resource dialogue.

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,450
So if I go on to change color primary dark for some reason, I click on that there, and that can

65
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,540
take a while to pop up

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:15,890
occasionally. So I can scroll down and choose something else. I could try choosing, perhaps, holo blue dark and

67
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:24,740
click OK, and you can see the change is being reflected over here to the right. And if you go back

68
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,880
to our styles files now and have a look.

69
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:35,590
Firstly in our regular styles dot xml, and look at color primary dark, and specifically down here under the AppTheme dot No

70
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,120
ActionBar, because remembering that's what we're editing, and you an see the item name equals color

71
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,310
PrimaryDark, and we've got the new definition that we've just specified.

72
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,160
And if we have a look in our v21, we've got a similar thing appearing there for colorPrimaryDark, down there on line 7.

73
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,870
and v23,

74
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,570
we've again got the same feature there.

75
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,910
So basically it's updated that style in all three files, and it,

76
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,610
in other words, it knew that this NoActionBar style was defined for

77
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,740
each of the three API levels, and made that change. So that's good.

78
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,060
Now one thing that it is really useful for, is defining your own colors.

79
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,520
Now with that said, I'm not suggesting you do that. Google's material design colours have been carefully chosen

80
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,670
to work well together.

81
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,610
But if you're an expert designer or you're matching a corporate style or something, then you may need

82
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,210
to use different colours.

83
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,160
So I'm going to use color primary for this, and click on the color image to get that resource

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,550
dialogue back. Then I'm going back into Theme Editor first, then color primary, I'm going to click on over here.

85
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,140
Now over to the right here,

86
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,320
there's two links.

87
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,310
You can see we've got Reference and Color.

88
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,830
So the Color link gives you a color picker and lets you define a new colour. So click over here,

89
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,450
and you want to make sure if you do that, that you give it a name at the top up here,

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,600
otherwise it's going to overwrite one of your existing colors.

91
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,250
Now it's just a standard color picker, and it shows the custom colour that you've chosen, as well as how text

92
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,100
will look using the primary and secondary text colours. And you can use a little dropper to the left of it

93
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,490
here, to to click on a color anywhere on the screen and it'll actually match it for you.

94
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,460
Now I certainly wouldn't recommend trying to create styles using this.

95
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,130
It's much more reliable to modify the xml, but it's there if you want to use it,

96
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,980
and by all means have a play with it.

97
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,230
But I do suggest you back up your xml files first, because if for example, if you change the theme

98
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,930
parent using the dropdown list, you can't always get the original ones back again.

99
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,530
Alright that's all I really wanted to say about it.

100
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,160
I've shown it to you, and if you decide to create styles using it,

101
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,420
then don't say I didn't warn you if something goes amiss. Now before I finish this video though, I'd better

102
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,400
put everything back.

103
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,690
So I'm going to close down or cancel out of this pop-up. I'm going to close down the Theme Editor, and in each of the style

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,830
files I'm going to go back and just remove that

105
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:56,270
extra line, the colorPrimaryDark that was added. So we're back on what we were before this video.

106
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,760
So v21 and v23 are back to our regular styles, and I'm going to remove that one down here as well, in the

107
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,360
AppTheme.NoActionBar.

108
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,330
So we've now got just those two entries in AppTheme.NoActionBar.

109
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,470
That was for the regular styles v23.

110
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,610
We've still got the extra two that were there prior to this video,

111
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,230
the v21, and we've just got those three.

112
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,850
And also check for additional styles files that may have been created.

113
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,890
It's easier to do that in the project view,

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,910
just make sure you've only got three styles files. So I can come back here and click on project and I can come down to

115
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,120
our values folders.

116
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,400
So you can see we've got styles which is in the original values folder, and we've got values v21 in styles and values v23

117
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,990
has only got a styles, so it hasn't created any more files in this case.

118
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,290
But if there are any others that the Theme Editor created, now is a good point to actually delete them and

119
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,770
I suggest you do that.

120
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,120
Alright so we're going to go back to Android view, and I'll end the video here, and in the next one

121
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,820
what we're going to do is experiment with the image that we show, when displaying the full photo.

122
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,440
So I'll see you in the next video.
