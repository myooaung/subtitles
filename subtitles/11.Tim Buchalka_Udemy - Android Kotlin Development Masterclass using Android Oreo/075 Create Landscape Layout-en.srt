1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,710
since we talked about at the end of the

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,020
last video in landscape mode the buttons

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,730
are far too close to the bottom of the

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,160
screen and there was a fair bit of space

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,949
between the widgets vertically so we

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,390
could start shuffling them up by

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,609
reducing their top margins and sometimes

8
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:21,470
you may have to do that but androids

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,720
they actually got another solution it's

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,910
possible to create separate layouts for

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,130
different screen sizes and landscape

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,810
counts as a different screen size to

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,210
portrait you know this particular layout

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,370
doesn't look the best in landscape so

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,870
let's have a look at how to use it as

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,489
the basis for a separate landscape

17
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:40,100
layout now this is quite a complex

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,629
layout and you may not feel too

19
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:43,129
confident about playing around with it

20
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,649
in case you mess it up but fortunately

21
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,179
there's an easy way to save everything

22
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,129
so you can put the layout back if things

23
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:50,269
go horribly wrong while you're

24
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:52,699
experimenting so we come over here and

25
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,010
click on text to go back into text mode

26
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,839
then we're going to copy all the text

27
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:00,289
control a on a PC or Linux or command a

28
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:03,620
on a Mac and I'm doing a command C but

29
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,710
it would be a ctrl C on Windows or a Mac

30
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,439
or of course you can go to the edit mode

31
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,659
and do a copy that way you could have

32
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,450
done a select or than a copy cetera but

33
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,820
anyway get a copy of the text as you can

34
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,979
see there and you can paste it into your

35
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,930
favorite editor and you couldn't even

36
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,399
create a new layout in Android studio

37
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:24,380
and paste it in there or although I

38
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,149
prefer to use a separate editors editor

39
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:28,460
so that I don't mess up and leave unused

40
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,670
our layout layouts in my app one word of

41
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,840
warning though be careful if you're

42
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,210
using TextEdit on a Mac and don't use

43
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,579
WordPad on Windows use notepad instead

44
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,679
the reason is that they can mess around

45
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:41,539
with text and do strange things like

46
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:44,299
trying to match up speech marks with 66

47
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,060
/ 99 characters instead on my Mac I'll

48
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,130
make sure text and edit is set in text

49
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,630
mode by going into the format menu so

50
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,530
I'm going to click on go into text edit

51
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,880
new document and they're gonna go into

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,340
format and I can select here make which

53
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,370
text as an option comes up and then it's

54
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,750
plain text mode so I'm clicking to

55
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,560
they're basically make plain text again

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,550
as you can see and you can see what the

57
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,930
control has changed there as well

58
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,970
I'm going to paste that T in there so

59
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,200
you'll do that in notepad if you're on

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,720
Windows or some other editor to take a

61
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,430
copy of what we've done so that we can

62
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,890
restore it if need be

63
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,209
so basically anytime you want to go back

64
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,370
to the layout as it is at the moment you

65
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,090
can just copy this text back into the

66
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,630
Android studio into the text tab and go

67
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,910
back to exactly what it was before all

68
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,370
right so back to Android studio I'm

69
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,890
gonna click on design again so to

70
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,840
actually create a separate layout for

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,670
landscape we just have to place a copy

72
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,860
of this layout in a special landscape

73
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,140
directory then modify it to work with

74
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,810
landscape but Android studio makes it

75
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,700
very easy to create layouts for

76
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,940
different orientations and screen sizes

77
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,019
so the button that switched from

78
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,790
portrait to landscape is another option

79
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,269
so I'll come over to here and you can

80
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,440
see that time on this option here

81
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,200
creates landscape variation and that

82
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,269
creates a new layout from the current

83
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:13,160
layout so I click on that now I'll open

84
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,040
up the project pane we just go and have

85
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,299
a look look at the layouts you can see

86
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,120
we've now got two files there and even

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
though they've got the same name you can

88
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,549
tell which one you're working with

89
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,040
because the editor tab prefix is the

90
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,900
name of lead so we've got the landscape

91
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,610
when I here land slash activity in the

92
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,590
school main we've got layout slash

93
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,880
activity underscore main so you'll

94
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,970
easily know which one is which and also

95
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,820
down here in the pre in the project pane

96
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,470
you can see the word land is in

97
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,299
parentheses to the right so you know

98
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:47,060
which one is the landscape version now

99
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,590
when you're working in landscape it's

100
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,000
very useful to be able to show either

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,430
design or the blueprint on their own

102
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,320
we're moving things around I prefer to

103
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,329
work in the blueprint so I'm just going

104
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,530
to use the button on the toolbar to

105
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,160
display it by itself and it close a

106
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,690
project page just give us a bit more

107
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,819
space

108
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,590
so how are we going to sort out the

109
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,200
layout for landscape now in landscape

110
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,450
we're actually short of screen depth but

111
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,700
we've got plenty of width now you may

112
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,410
come up with other ways to layout the

113
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,449
widgets for landscape but I'm just going

114
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,330
to place the two edit text widgets

115
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,550
side-by-side on the same line they're

116
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,990
gonna start by changing the base

117
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,880
constraint of the operation takes you so

118
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,229
let's click on here the operation we

119
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,120
want to lied that to the button seven

120
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,130
widget instead you know it's still going

121
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,479
to be a baseline constraint but we're

122
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,729
gonna move it down the screen now this

123
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,680
is the widget that we had trouble with

124
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,090
in the previous video because it's so

125
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,949
small I'm just going to expand the

126
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,750
properties of these pane over here the

127
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,400
inspector and we're gonna have a look at

128
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,039
our constraints again and we're gonna

129
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,349
come down here where we've got baseline

130
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,300
to baseline of which is currently set to

131
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,169
a new number you used to drop down we're

132
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,820
going to change that to button seven

133
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,490
instead and you can see it move down the

134
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,560
screen when I did that now it would be

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,060
confusing to have a constraint to two

136
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,949
different widgets so I'm going to change

137
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:13,020
both constraints

138
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,220
although the constraint names can't be

139
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,169
read properly without making the pane

140
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,599
wider we can see which one was set to

141
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,949
number two new number so I'm just going

142
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,560
to change the both it'll change that one

143
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,750
now instead of a new number you know if

144
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,610
you find in this particular case that it

145
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,280
doesn't give you the full list of

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,539
buttons you come over here and click on

147
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,699
the ellipsis and select button seven

148
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,580
that way click on OK then it result is

149
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,530
we've now got it changed both

150
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,810
constraints new constraint a button

151
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,050
seven alright so the next step is to

152
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,400
delete the top and right edge

153
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,680
constraints on new number and the left

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,720
edge constraint and result so I'm gonna

155
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,449
go back to our normal properties instead

156
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,610
of the extended ones so selecting new

157
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,220
number so we're going to delete the top

158
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,889
and right edge constraints on new number

159
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,960
and the left edge constraint and result

160
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,190
and to delete the top first at the right

161
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,810
edge on your number delete them as well

162
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,419
the constraint that is then the left

163
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,940
left edge constraint and result and

164
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,650
result was this previous one so I'm

165
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,979
going to delete that as well now the

166
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:20,080
right edge of new number two

167
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,520
didn't be constrained to the left edge

168
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,800
of result let's do that first let's

169
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,319
drain it to the left edge of result and

170
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,509
then we also want a baseline constraint

171
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,370
crate created for the two so we'll come

172
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,770
over here click on the blue button to

173
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,830
enable the baseline constraint they're

174
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,780
going to constrain it like so

175
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,400
oops I didn't quite click it then try it

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,169
again that's better now we have to put

177
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:48,849
the baseline constraint from new number

178
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,590
to result rather than the other way

179
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,870
around because it's result that has the

180
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,940
vertical constraint to the top of the

181
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,699
screen of course you could change that

182
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,050
but it doesn't actually matter which way

183
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,150
we ended or goes now you could also

184
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,370
constrain new number to the top of the

185
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,250
layout instead but by anchoring the to

186
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,680
edit text widgets together we only have

187
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,210
to move one on the other will follow

188
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,610
now the buns aren't sentient but we'll

189
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,620
come back to that in fact there are a

190
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,909
few things wrong with the landscape

191
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,050
layout and we're going to be looking at

192
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,389
them all a little bit later but that's

193
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,430
the layout for the calculator app

194
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,710
completed for now so let's actually run

195
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,599
it to see how it all looks so I'm just

196
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,860
got a runner and we'll just check it out

197
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,150
then the emulator just to see what it

198
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,430
does look like

199
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,379
okay so there it is in portrait mode so

200
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,250
that's looking okay and we go over to

201
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,520
landscape and you can see it's looking

202
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,199
okay so we're not perfect but we need to

203
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,120
make a few changes to that but you can

204
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,729
see that it's looking much better

205
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:52,050
because of the additional layout that we

206
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,449
created in landscape mode so at this

207
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,830
point now we're ready to start writing

208
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,770
the code to make it calculate the last

209
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,060
thing I'm going to do is I'm just going

210
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,939
to go back to portrait and go back into

211
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,460
the code and for both the layout files

212
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,770
what I'm going to do is let's go into

213
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,830
the text view and if you click on the

214
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,240
code menu and rearrange code I'm going

215
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,099
to do that for that one and also for the

216
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:21,289
other layout as well do the same thing

217
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:30,950
code rearranged

218
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,050
just so everything's in a standard order

219
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,580
I'm just gonna go back to design on both

220
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,980
of those and I'm doing that to the

221
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,870
reason I did the reformat code from the

222
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,430
code menu just so everything is in a

223
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,350
standard order if you need to compare

224
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,900
your code with mine and in the next

225
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,040
video I'm going to actually going to

226
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,930
show you how to use Antoine junior to

227
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,000
compare files so that you can compare

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,380
your code to mine if you get any

229
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,960
problems and are struggling to work out

230
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,940
what's different so let's get started

231
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,960
with that in the next video
