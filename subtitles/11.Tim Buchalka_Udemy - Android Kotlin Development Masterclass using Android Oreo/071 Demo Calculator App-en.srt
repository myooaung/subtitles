1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,640
in this section we're going to create a

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,590
basic calculator as you can see on the

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,180
screen and it's going to give us a

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,770
chance to practice what we've learnt

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,930
about layouts with a more complex

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,119
example and we'll also be connecting

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,980
code to a lot more buttons than in our

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,010
previous button click app in this

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,150
section we're going to look at working

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,370
with groups of widgets to see how we can

11
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,410
do things like constraining them to be

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,960
positioned as a group as well as setting

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,910
common properties for multiple widgets

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,520
at the same time and we'll also show a

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,680
slightly different approach to creating

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,670
an onclicklistener

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,039
so that the same method can be used by

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,289
multiple buttons now this happens you

19
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:43,690
can see is a basic calculator and in

20
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,249
order to enter numbers using the apps

21
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,469
buttons then perform the calculation

22
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,449
when any of the operation keys are

23
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,399
pressed the plus minus multiply and

24
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,280
divide now the stock Android calculator

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,379
builds up the calculation on the screen

26
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,929
and doesn't actually evaluate it until

27
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,059
you press the equal sign but else is

28
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,129
going to evaluate each sum as soon as

29
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,409
you press the next operator just like

30
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,570
early calculators did and we'll have two

31
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,100
lines for display as you can see though

32
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,960
so you will now be able to see both

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,760
numbers at once and won't have to

34
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,500
remember the previous one like you did

35
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,050
with those early calculators and also

36
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,300
unlike the early calculators it'll show

37
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,250
you which operation it will perform next

38
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,040
so you don't lose track pressing equals

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,750
will update the display with the result

40
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,970
and can also be used to start a new

41
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,340
calculation by transferring the entered

42
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,800
number up into the result ready to use

43
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,770
in the next calculation well let's have

44
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,030
a quick demonstration here of this

45
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,620
calculator app to see how it actually

46
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,870
works so I can enter a number like by

47
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:47,850
clicking on it 9 and multiply 3 equals

48
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,070
27 then I can also continue with that by

49
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,530
putting 10 multiplied you can see the

50
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,660
values getting updated there and we can

51
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,630
clear it by just pressing equals and I

52
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,350
can type in something like 20 plus to

53
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,670
add 20 to it so I've got the value of

54
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,830
290 and the other thing that we're going

55
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,789
to be doing in this section of the

56
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,470
course is working with both portrait and

57
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,660
landscape versions so if I move this

58
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,530
over to landscape now

59
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,580
you can see we've got a slightly

60
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,800
different result there we've got the

61
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,840
layout looking a little bit different to

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,810
take advantage of landscape mode so be

63
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,730
learning how to do that as well I'll

64
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,480
just move that back to portrait note

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,490
also that the value that we've been

66
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,620
using stayed there when we moved from

67
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,780
landscape to back to portrait and then

68
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,700
from portrait to landscape and we'll

69
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,500
also be showing you how to do that in

70
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,260
the section for the course as well and

71
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,370
later in this section we're going to

72
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,650
have a look at guidelines which can be

73
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,260
used in a constraint layout to a link

74
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,520
widgets either vertically or

75
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,870
horizontally so that you can anchor

76
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,790
widgets to them all right so let's move

77
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,860
back near to Android studio and we can

78
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,400
start work on this project so let's get

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,470
started now creating a new project and

80
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,240
then in the next video we're going to

81
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,800
look at the actual layout of our

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,410
calculator so start Android studio and

83
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,820
we're going to click on start a new

84
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Android studio project and I'm gonna

85
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,110
call this calculator I'm going to leave

86
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,239
the company domain name the same learn

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,340
programming down Academy now Android

88
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,519
studio is suggesting a suitable location

89
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,420
project location ending with a

90
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,519
calculator directory and you can store

91
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,350
the project somewhere else if you want

92
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,269
but the Android studio normally

93
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,010
remembers where you've told it to create

94
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,440
projects so only the final directory

95
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,239
name changes so I'm going to leave it as

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,550
the default on screen there and there's

97
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,780
another important option we have to

98
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,459
select on the screen and that's this

99
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,380
option down here to include Coughlin's

100
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,780
support now remember to tick that box if

101
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,730
you want to generate Kotlin code and

102
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,019
make sure it's unpicked

103
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,480
if you want Java code in my case I'm

104
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,920
going to leave it ticked and click on

105
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,590
next then we're going to continue to use

106
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,170
the minimum SDK of 17 and you can see

107
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,320
this API 17 is already selected here so

108
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,400
you want to make sure that that is

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
checked and leave everything else

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,030
unchecked and then click on next again

111
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,320
now we're not going to have a menu in

112
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,720
this application so empty activity which

113
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,669
is selected here for me automatically is

114
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,530
our best choice for the template to you

115
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,900
so make sure you select that and I click

116
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,140
on Next again and once again we're just

117
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,700
kind of accept the names that Android

118
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,099
studio has suggested for both the

119
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,660
activity name and the layer

120
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,330
and just make sure that both both the

121
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,910
generate layout file and backwards

122
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,190
compatibility app compat check boxes are

123
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,300
checked and then click on finish so

124
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,800
that's the project created I'm going to

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,410
leave it just building and in the next

126
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,180
video we'll actually start producing the

127
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,400
layout for our calculator app so I'll

128
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,360
see you in the next video
