00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.600

So I just want to spend a few minutes



2

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.770

going through some of the information



3

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.200

and the way that the udemy course layout



4

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.330

works just so you can really get the



5

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.549

most out of this course. Now if you've



6

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.230

already used udemy a lot and you're



7

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.150

familiar with the udemy interface then



8

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.980

feel free to warn on to the end of this



9

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.929

video they'll click on the progress bar



10

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.939

on the bottom of the screen and if you



11

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.439

let the last couple of seconds play than



12

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.599

the video gets marked as completed but



13

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.009

if you're not really familiar with the



14

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.660

udemy interface then this video might be



15

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480

useful for you, so first I want to talk



16

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.490

about searching for lectures, there with



17

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.110

the new layout of the udemy course



18

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.330

dashboard searching for specific course



19

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.970

lectures is so much easier. Now in the



20

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.650

main course dashboard as you can see in



21

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.300

the screen there, are the course content



22

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.910

tab you can find the lecture search box



23

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.340

as you can see on the screen now just



24

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.930

type in the specific lecture words



25

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.910

you're looking for and udemy will



26

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.860

display all lectures that have those



27

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.870

words in the title and you can also



28

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.090

search for questions and answers by



29

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.370

going to the Q&A tab, you'll find the



30

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.619

question search box below so type in a



31

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.360

question and udemy will find



32

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.100

questions and answers that are similar



33

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.260

to what you're asking about just



34

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.880

basically clicked on there any of those



35

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.530

that pop up to reveal answers that



36

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.990

relate to your question, often you'll



37

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.730

find answers to your question by doing



38

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.530

that. Now if you can't find answers to



39

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.300

your question you can create one by



40

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.560

clicking on the add a new question



41

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.200

button then typing in your question then



42

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.330

with the questions editor, you can enter



43

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.950

a title for your question and put the



44

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.409

content in the main box, when you're done



45

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.350

click on post question, to well to post



46

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.900

the question. Now when your questions



47

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.909

been solved by either myself, Jean-Paul



48

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.560

or even one of the other students in



49

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.870

this course it's a good idea to mark for



50

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.120

question as solved and you do that by



51

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.979

editing the question then adding the



52

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.530

phrase solved in square brackets. Now the



53

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.940

reason for that is that it makes it



54

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.950

easier for others to find answers to



55

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.740

questions similar to yours when the list



56

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.290

of questions and answers pops up they'll



57

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.850

see solved in square brackets and they



58

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.799

can choose the solve ones to look at



59

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.510

first and that can save time because



60

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.280

they'll have an indication that those



61

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.560

questions have a solution and it also



62

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.899

helps if you summarize your question in



63

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.390

the title, titles like help or error



64

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.159

don't really give any indication of what



65

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.709

the question relates to so in many cases



66

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.460

other students won't bother reading



67

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.380

them. Now you may not think that's very



68

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.600

important but it is really a good habit



69

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.470

to get into,



70

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.450

as you develop in your career as a



71

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.640

programmer, you'll almost certainly raise



72

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.710

issues on the Google issues tracker or



73

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.810

Microsoft's bug reporting system or



74

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.180

whatever technology it is that you found



75

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.430

a problem with. Now developing the habit



76

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.470

of providing good titles for issues and



77

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.000

describing the problem with as much



78

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.150

detail as possible to reproduce it will



79

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.770

pay dividends when you need to get help



80

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.030

from or whoever supporting the



81

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.610

environment that you're working in you



82

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.320

can also edit a post to provide more



83

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.030

information perhaps or correct typing



84

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.500

errors by clicking on the three vertical



85

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.510

dots in the top right-hand side and then



86

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.370

choosing in it now after clicking on



87

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.690

edit you'll be able to edit the title



88

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.600

and contents of your question and if the



89

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.670

question solved adds solved again to the



90

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.290

title as mentioned in square brackets.



91

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.750

Now every lecture has its own source



92

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.580

code in this course as well as other



93

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.260

resources that are appropriate to that



94

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.030

lecture, links etc that have been



95

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.310

discussed in that video, so if you want



96

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.230

to grab the source code for any lecture



97

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.060

you can do so by clicking on the



98

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.490

resources section of the video and you



99

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.080

can see the resources box in the left



100

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.210

hand corner, it's highlighted in blue to



101

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.040

tell you that there are resources there



102

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.960

for you to look at and download as



103

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.240

appropriate. So when clicking on the 3



104

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.430

bar menu icon above the resources



105

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.980

available link, the player will open up



106

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.170

on a menu on the left hand side and show



107

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.200

you the resource links for that lecture.



108

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.370

Now the second place you can look for



109

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.840

source code for all projects in this



110

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.360

course is in the source code for all



111

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.160

apps lecture right at the bottom of the



112

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.980

course in the extras section. Now with



113

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.420

the source code for all apps lecture,



114

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.100

you'll find links to download the source



115

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.070

code for each lecture in the course.



116

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.540

Well that's the next course announcements



117

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.400

you'll find course announcements in the



118

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.230

announcements tab, so checking this



119

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.610

section out will keep you updated on new



120

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.440

content being added to the course and



121

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.390

anything that we find interesting that



122

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.160

we send out to let you know the latest



123

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.440

developments in all things Android and



124

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.700

if you want to share your opinion about



125

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.860

the course and your experience of it you



126

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.989

can leave a review by clicking on the



127

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.960

rate this course button on the dashboard.



128

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.190

Now I know that Udemy automatically



129

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.140

ask you for a reviews anyway, but if



130

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.250

that's something you want to do then



131

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.410

that's how to do it. Now you can decide



132

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.880

how many stars you're going to give the



133

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.530

course as well as typing in a review



134

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.280

when you don't, just click some



135

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.380

you can also go back and change a review



136

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.690

using a similar process clicking on the



137

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.150

same link in future, some students feel



138

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.770

that they get asked to leave a review



139

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.290

too early in the course, the udemy system



140

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.060

does that automatically but you can



141

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.100

always use the ask me later button if



142

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.300

you're not yet ready to leave your



143

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.970

review. Now the video player used by udemy



144

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.520

has many great features if you



145

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.230

want to change the video quality hover



146

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.760

your mouse over the gear icon on the



147

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.830

right hand side, then click the quality



148

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.750

that you want the video to be played at,



149

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.120

the higher the number the better.



150

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.710

Now all the videos in this course are



151

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.560

created in 1080p, which is the highest



152

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.780

possible quality and that's probably the



153

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.790

best experience if you can play that



154

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.560

resolution on your computer,



155

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.570

Now keep in mind that the way udemy



156

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.060

use their video player that you may not



157

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.460

be offered that 1080p mode if your



158

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.380

internet connection that isn't fast



159

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.060

enough, it's something that's outside of



160

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.550

the control of an instructor but if you



161

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.110

computers fast enough you should get the



162

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.690

option for 1080p. Now if you want to



163

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.220

change the speed of the video while it's



164

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.229

playing, you can do that by hovering over



165

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.060

the One X or icon and choosing from the



166

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.370

various video speeds and that can be



167

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.600

useful if you want to hear me speak



168

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.700

faster or slower to aid your



169

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.070

understanding. In most videos, we'll have



170

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.050

captions for you to enable them just



171

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.700

hover your mouse over the captions icon



172

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.190

and click on the available language that



173

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.960

you want to display with the video at



174

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.130

the moment they're only available in



175

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.200

English, but it can be quite useful to



176

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.580

watch the videos with the captions



177

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.620

enabled to get the most out of them.



178

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.210

Alright so that's the end of the video



179

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.130

Let's move on now after having a look at



180

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.140

what Android is and some of the user



181

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.610

interface things that we'll be learning



182

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.250

how to control in this course. So see you



183

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.820

in the next video.
