00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.490

Right.



2

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.320

So we talked about in the last video how storing Stipe was a bad idea hit because you'll often end up



3

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.610

struggling to keep you stored value up to date.



4

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.260

So how do we go about fixing this.



5

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.560

So we're not doing that whole Thursley for this particular app.



6

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.090

I'm going to start by getting rid of the read granted field and if you recall we had that right at the



7

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.560

top.



8

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.780

So I'm going to comment that Alan 1:26 that's a consequence of that we now know I'm going to set that



9

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.840

value here.



10

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.950

So I'm going to come at that at remembering that that was one of those commenting that out you know



11

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.460

forget it to the on request permission was out and to this function here on Long 91 we need to remove



12

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.540

all references now to write grant.



13

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.510

So let's say that I want I'm going to do firstly is I'm going to take a copy of this law and I'm going



14

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.190

to come at that and I'm going to remove the part of the copy that was actually going to sign the value



15

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.240

to be granted and we're going to comment out the true and the false because we no longer need that anymore.



16

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.410

There's been no discussion an explicit call they were not basically citing state that we're saving the



17

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.580

state of that.



18

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.870

All right.



19

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.150

Now on that we can change the condition in the Fabs on curriculum.



20

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.530

So let's go back up and do that.



21

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.920

And he's our Cardiff's telling on 1:46.



22

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:35.500

So I'm basically going to comment out that line and replace it with and if he is if parentheses context



23

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:44.560

compact dot check self permission that in parentheses described to me this comma is going to be read



24

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.350

on the spot contact's one right parentheses and that's equal to package manager got permission for granted



25

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.590

closing parentheses and at left.



26

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.560

Kelly Brice to make that law valid now.



27

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.540

Now we'll talk a bit more about what we've done later.



28

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.130

But first let's let's actually check and say that this works.



29

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.260

So I'm going to stop this and we're going to get back to our emulator.



30

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.770

I will delete this app again will uninstall.



31

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.560

I want to do the same testing we did previously.



32

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560

Let's go ahead and do that.



33

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.110

To run it again.



34

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.760

Bring the latter up



35

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.710

right.



36

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.830

So we're at the same position we were previously when we started testing in the last video.



37

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.550

So our first test is to deny access.



38

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.880

So let's go ahead and do that.



39

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.590

Mission with.



40

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.450

We still got the snack bar still comes back and if we come back and click on grant access that works



41

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.070

as it can say and you can say we've got a call showing here.



42

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.580

And request permission was called there as you can see I can click on this Tom the box I'll check that



43

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910

and click on deny access again.



44

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.460

Permission refuse appears again in the lockout which we would expect and we can tell if the fab again



45

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.000

would grant access showing you click on that and we get taken to the settings.



46

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.110

So that's good that's working.



47

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.660

OK.



48

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.000

Now what I would do first is I'll click and we'll use the back button to come straight back with that



49

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.450

running Access.



50

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.570

That takes us back to our code and click on the fap again.



51

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.270

It's still requesting access and taking it back to the settings.



52

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.910

Hopefully my click on access.



53

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.290

It does so that's working.



54

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.300

If we go into the settings but don't grant access then the app still can't access the context which



55

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.140

is correct.



56

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.190

But click on the grant access slinky getting a compact first.



57

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.860

I could have FEBE I can Productus again this time I go into permissions this time I'll check or select



58

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.100

the contacts permission to give us access to that and never get back to the app by clicking on back



59

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.830

a few times.



60

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.350

Tap the fab and you can now say we immediately have got access to our contacts.



61

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.130

So that's now working fine.



62

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.320

Now that we've removed the site within our application or we're moved citing that site.



63

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.590

All right so I'm going to finish the video here in the next one.



64

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.990

We're going to talk a bit more about tastes and how it's a good idea to create test scripts to make



65

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.730

sure that you're covering all possible situations.



66

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.030

So see you in the next video.
