1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,930
all right so going on to the solution to

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,280
the challenge that we talked about at

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,230
the end of the last video the first

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,820
thing that we're going to do is add the

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,339
Refresh option to the menu now that's

6
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:16,869
very simple I'm just going to drag a new

7
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:19,630
item into the design to make sure that

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,070
it's below the group and not a member of

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,900
it and we talked about that previously

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,789
so menu item and you can either do it

11
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,010
here or come down here so it's easy to

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,359
do it down here in the component tree

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,460
usually and you can see there that I've

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,080
dragged it so it's actually in the wrong

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,840
place but I can move that out to make

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,059
sure then it's no longer in the menu

17
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:42,280
anymore and no longer in the menu group

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,250
anymore which is what we want here next

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,070
we want to change the ID the ID is going

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:54,100
to be a menu refresh and the title will

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,460
make refresh alright so that's it for

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:05,640
the menu and we'll go back to the code

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,770
alright so if we go to track the gyro so

24
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,420
that we can compare the previous one to

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,500
the one that we're about to download

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,929
then we need a variable to store it in

27
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,479
now we're also going to be storing the

28
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,550
URL and a limit in a bundle so we were

29
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,160
to find two constants to use as the keys

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,959
we're going to do that at the top of

31
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,679
main activity just below the feet limit

32
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:28,630
and feed gyro that we worked on in the

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,940
last two videos so we start with a

34
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:38,979
private their feed cached URL is equal

35
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,200
to and we'll start with double quotes

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,170
invalidated in private Val state and the

37
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:53,670
school URL is equal to feed URL and

38
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,060
private Val state let's call limit

39
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,520
equals feed limit now I've initialized

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,700
the feed case URL string to a value that

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,670
can't possibly be a valid URL you know

42
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,260
anytime we want to force a download to

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,660
happen such as when the Refresh option

44
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,880
is chosen from the menu we just need to

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,930
set it to some value that isn't a year

46
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,969
roll you know anything would do but I've

47
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,700
just used the word invalidated now to

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,140
prevent the same URL from being

49
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,609
downloaded unnecessarily

50
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:28,010
we just need to compare the cached URL

51
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,140
value with the one that we're about to

52
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,120
download and if they're the same there's

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,549
no need to download again so let's go

54
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:37,310
down to at the download URL function to

55
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,430
do that so down here we're going to wrap

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,109
this in some code we're going to put an

57
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:49,459
if test here to say if parentheses feed

58
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:55,480
URL is not equal to feed cached URL

59
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,769
we're going to wrap that code so we're

60
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,650
going to copy this code paste it in

61
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,549
there okay and I'm going to then put an

62
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:09,040
else in there so else block dot d

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,939
parentheses tag I'm a download URL URL

64
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,560
not changed so now with that code when

65
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,319
download URL is called it first checks

66
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,419
the euro it's given against the stored

67
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,639
value now if they're the same and

68
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,810
there's no need to download the data

69
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,569
again you just log the fact so that we

70
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:33,859
can see the code working in the logcat

71
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,229
but of course if the euro is a different

72
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,400
there's going to go through and execute

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,189
normally and importantly the other thing

74
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,840
we need to do is we need to update the

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,379
value at the end of that feed cached URL

76
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,540
is equal to feed URL so basically after

77
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,069
downloading the data as usual we're

78
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,540
stirring the URL that's just been

79
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,150
downloaded in the feed cached URL field

80
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,120
ready to be compared next time all right

81
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,599
so onto the refresh menu option now all

82
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,930
that has to do is set feed cached URL to

83
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,599
something different to the last URL so

84
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,799
that's pretty straightforward so let's

85
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,720
have a look at the option the heavy on

86
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,930
options item selected we're going to use

87
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,549
the string invalidated because we've

88
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,530
used that before so we're going to put

89
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,870
this code here outside of the either

90
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,509
Aidid up menu 10 and menu 25 tests

91
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:29,120
I don't ID don't a menu refresh or a

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,310
token when I put feed cached you

93
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,680
equals to validate all right so I'm

94
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,180
using that string and validated it'll

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,250
actually validate it'll be consistent so

96
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,500
using that string again as that helps to

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,719
document what we're doing so the case

98
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,310
URL has been invalidated

99
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,080
so the download will then meet and we

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,349
were be performed again all right so

101
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:53,490
that's one part of the challenge

102
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,069
completed the app should now shouldn't

103
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,500
now download the data again if we select

104
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,990
the same menu item again so it's worth

105
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,550
testing the app at this point to make

106
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,039
sure the code works if you leave testing

107
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,960
into you've made loads of changes it

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,659
gets much harder to find bugs you've got

109
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,909
far more code to check through running

110
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:13,469
your app after making each change is a

111
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,389
good habit to get into and it really

112
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,610
does make debugging a lot easier so

113
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,069
let's actually run this I'm going to go

114
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:29,520
back to portrait mode

115
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,819
all right so far so good the app loads

116
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,380
the first URL fine so that's a good

117
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:34,770
start

118
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,410
so just to confirm that the menus to

119
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,940
works we'll try doing a different type

120
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,210
with songs well that still works we

121
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,370
still get the top ten songs all right

122
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,280
open the logcat and we're going to do a

123
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,340
search we're going to rather select the

124
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,910
same option again songs and you can see

125
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,729
here in the logcat

126
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:59,370
download URL URL not changed so that's

127
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,590
working as well so things seem to be

128
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,210
working pretty good but to make sure

129
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,430
that the app still uses the same URL and

130
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,680
feed limit after being rotated we need

131
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,930
to store the values of the URL and the

132
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,849
feed limit when the activity is

133
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,860
destroyed so let's go back in there add

134
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,490
the code for that and what I'm going to

135
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,889
do is just put the cursor below the on

136
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,360
options item selected method function

137
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,009
and let's say get Android studio to

138
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:27,930
generate the on savings and state

139
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,389
function so I'm going to do my ctrl o

140
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,870
and we were on save instance State

141
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,729
they're remembering there's two versions

142
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,710
of this function we want the one with

143
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,240
it's just got a single parameter that

144
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,409
we're looking at currently that's got

145
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,639
two options I'm gonna press the down

146
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,199
arrow to go to the second one with the

147
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,710
single parameter press Enter

148
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,120
alright there another end of that

149
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,070
between of e on options aren't selected

150
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,250
and on destroy so that ondestroy ends up

151
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,909
being the last function in the class so

152
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,440
we're going to now write some code in

153
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,630
there so we're going to start by

154
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,900
removing the question mark from bundle

155
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,099
we're going to leave the super diamonds

156
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,740
on savings and state line in we're going

157
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:14,639
to put our state dot put string and it's

158
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,930
going to be state let's call euro comma

159
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,500
and feed euro then on the next line out

160
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,180
state dot put string state on this call

161
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,919
limit feed limit and that shouldn't be

162
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,500
in the string it should be an int let's

163
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,699
change it to an it because of course

164
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,630
feed limit is a number okay that fixes

165
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,760
that now we saw code like that before in

166
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,990
the calculator map it just

167
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,430
towards our two fields so that we can

168
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,590
call them back again when the activities

169
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,410
recreated now the bundles passed in as a

170
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,540
nullable top but we know that it won't

171
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,390
be no and as a result I changed the

172
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,610
function signature by removing the

173
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,250
question mark after bundle now remember

174
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,800
that dates are stored in a bundle using

175
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,740
key value pairs we specify a key when

176
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,870
saving something and use the same key to

177
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,730
get it back again and do we see that

178
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,370
Delta keys state underscore URL and

179
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,680
state underscore limit being used again

180
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,320
when we retrieve the values shortly now

181
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,880
when we saved a restored values

182
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,550
previously we used the on restore

183
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,990
instance State and function

184
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,180
now in that app though we weren't doing

185
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,980
anything in oncreate other than

186
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,650
inflating the calculator layer so it's

187
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,480
probably a good idea just to review the

188
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,420
activity lifecycle all right so all

189
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,480
restore instance state is called after

190
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,030
the oncreate method however we do the

191
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,700
initial download in oncreate so when the

192
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,070
device is rotated we need to retrieve

193
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,370
the saved bundle in the oncreate method

194
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,170
rather than in on restore instance date

195
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,210
because if we wait for own restore

196
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,830
instance state we won't have the URL

197
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,530
available when we need it all right so

198
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,120
when the activities first launched there

199
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,460
won't be a bundle but if the activity's

200
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,280
restarted because of device rotation for

201
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,500
example then the bundle passed to

202
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,900
uncreate we non null and we can restore

203
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,970
our fields there so let's actually write

204
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,130
some code now in the oncreate method to

205
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,430
achieve this so there's our one create

206
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,660
method and we're going to put some code

207
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,300
after the last logging well actually

208
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,010
what we'll do is we'll put it after the

209
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,130
start so we've got the super duck on

210
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,490
create and the set content view or put

211
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,790
it on log entry they're logged on T

212
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,490
tagged parentheses uncreate called and

213
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,570
then we're going to put our code in here

214
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,470
with parentheses save instance state is

215
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,460
not equal to null or the code block then

216
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,700
we're going to put feed URL is equal to

217
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,620
save instance state dot get string it's

218
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,340
going to state underscore euro

219
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,660
we feed limit is equal to save instance

220
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,550
state dot get int state and it's got a

221
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,860
limit now when we're dealing with the

222
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,140
bundle in oncreate we have to Kate it

223
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,180
for it being no and that's because it

224
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,190
definitely will be at least some other

225
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,860
time now I know Kotlin tries to do away

226
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,630
with no checks but sometimes they're

227
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,690
valid even in Kotlin so here now is a

228
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,570
valid value for the bundle it signifies

229
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,820
that there's nothing to restore now

230
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,350
because we've performed a null check

231
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,589
Collin can perform a smart cast so save

232
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,350
instance state is cast to be an unknown

233
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,630
bundle and we don't have to use the safe

234
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,610
call operator when accessing the get

235
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,610
string and get into methods all right so

236
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,930
we're now ready to test the program to

237
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,670
make sure it meets all the requirements

238
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,980
of the challenge so let's actually run

239
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,140
this again so what I'll do is open up

240
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,690
blog cat and run it if a lot cat doesn't

241
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,890
clear for you then you want to have

242
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,120
Berkeley it up but you can see in my

243
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,410
case I did and then we've got the data

244
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,530
and we've got the log cat showing so

245
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,390
let's first check a few URLs with

246
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,339
different limits to make sure we haven't

247
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,470
broken anything that was working and

248
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,480
then we go back to the emulator so we've

249
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,310
got the top 10 feeds in there so that's

250
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,320
a good start and you can see that we've

251
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,740
got the 10 entries in there

252
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,080
okay so that's working alright let's do

253
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,510
a change that and go for a limit of 25

254
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,750
okay clearly we've got more apps showing

255
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,580
here so that's working like okay as well

256
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,220
the top 25 if I go ahead and choose

257
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,460
songs now we should get 25 songs and

258
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,590
that's because for the top 25 was

259
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,370
selected so click on songs and what we

260
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,100
can do is just do a filter for main

261
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,110
activity you can see that there's a feed

262
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,730
limit was set to 25 and it hasn't been

263
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,920
reset since if we have a look at the

264
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,500
songs clearly there's more than 10 there

265
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,330
so that seems to be working nicely as

266
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,220
well and in terms of the year well if we

267
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,750
go back and remove the filter we can see

268
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,420
here by looking in the XML that clearly

269
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,060
that is talking about albums and so

270
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,770
forth so clearly that song so that's

271
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,740
correct now well we've got a top 25 feet

272
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,740
it's a good point or good time to rotate

273
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,910
the device to make sure it doesn't

274
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,070
revert to the default top 10 that it was

275
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,220
doing before so let's go back and rotate

276
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:37,010
now to have a look it looks to me we've

277
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,180
still got two heaps of songs this

278
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,620
everything seems to be working nicely as

279
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,990
well we've got 25 songs there if I

280
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,880
scroll down a little bit more we can see

281
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,440
that it's definitely still the songs and

282
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,700
we can see that on the screen anyway so

283
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,130
that's working nicely now if we go back

284
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:56,210
and choose songs again and we can just

285
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,940
do a filter here main activity again we

286
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,890
can see that download URL URL is not

287
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,350
changed which is correct so that's

288
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,030
looking good and now the last check is

289
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,090
to check songs again to make sure that

290
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,710
the data is read downloaded when the

291
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,210
same type of feed is selected for the

292
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:18,220
second time so let's try that Souls

293
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,400
and again download euro not changed so

294
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,480
that's looking good as well

295
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,640
now you may well have solved a challenge

296
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,440
in a different way but if it passes

297
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,050
these tests then well done and

298
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,520
everything's working so that's the end

299
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,140
of this section well we've actually

300
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,300
covered quite a lot in this section so

301
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,330
we used an async task to download data

302
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,550
without blocking the main UI thread and

303
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,150
also use the built-in HTTP classes to

304
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,490
download data from the internet then we

305
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,170
looked at the supplied XML parser

306
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,780
classes to parse XML from the downloaded

307
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,390
data and store the values we want it in

308
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,090
our own objects now the ListView widgets

309
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,920
designed for displaying lists of data

310
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,050
and we saw how to connect that to a

311
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,390
basic adapter we then went further and

312
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,940
created our own custom adapter to give

313
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,440
more control over how the data is

314
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
displayed in the ListView and we

315
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,520
finished by creating our own menus and

316
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,740
many groups and writing code to respond

317
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,600
to the different menu items being

318
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,540
selected all right so now you have a

319
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,550
basic app you can have a go at changing

320
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,830
things to improve it so some ideas you

321
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,350
might want to try at this point are

322
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,670
adding some more of the Apple feeds such

323
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,460
as the albums or new releases feeds you

324
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,530
could try passing out the feed title

325
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,960
from the downloaded XML and displaying

that in a text view above the list so it

327
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,190
users have a reminder of which view

328
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,080
they're seen perhaps you might want to

329
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,120
try figuring out how to display the

330
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,060
image URL in a text view and searching

331
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,410
online for how to make the links

332
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,300
clickable so that they open in the

333
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,060
devices browser now it's helpful to

334
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,100
watch these videos a few times to really

335
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,410
understand what's happening and while we

336
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,690
coded the app in this way now you'll

337
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,220
find you pick up different things each

338
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,740
time you watch the videos remember also

339
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,940
that there's a wealth of information

340
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,490
available online so if you're not sure

341
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,230
how to do something then a quick search

342
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,180
will usually provide loads of

343
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,460
information now the Google documentation

344
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,830
is also very useful even if most of the

345
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,480
examples are currently written in Java

346
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,610
but I suspect over time that will change

347
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,950
and we'll start seeing Kotlin examples

348
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,200
as well so I'll stop the video here and

349
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,810
in this section and in the next section

350
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,250
we're going to create an app to view

351
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,250
YouTube videos using Google's YouTube

352
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,530
API see you in the next video
