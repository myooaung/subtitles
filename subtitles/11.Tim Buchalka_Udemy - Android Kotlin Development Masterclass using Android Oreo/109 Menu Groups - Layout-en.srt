1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:06,680
in this video we're going to add two

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,750
options to the menu so that we can

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,440
choose between the top 10 and top 25 now

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,820
this will be slightly different to the

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,830
menu items we've already got because

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,810
once you've chosen either top 10 or top

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,939
25 that choice will remain in effect

8
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:23,119
until you change it and also when you

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,070
select the top 10 it will automatically

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,910
select the top 25 and vice versa so I'm

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,919
going to edit the feeds menu to add

12
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:34,399
these new options so open the fees and

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,840
it's called menu layout if you haven't

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,610
already and let's see how to add these

15
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,280
menu items with the option buttons now

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,170
the way we do that is to use a menu

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,300
group so the first thing we're going to

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,730
do is grab is drag a group from the

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,460
pallet onto the design this time there

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,260
you have to be more careful and watch

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,270
the orange highlighting because we don't

22
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,010
want to place it between any of the

23
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,320
existing items and I'll just show you

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,910
what I mean by that they're gonna select

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,450
the group that new to be careful where

26
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,339
you're placing it and in fact what I

27
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,710
want to do is what I find much easier is

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,240
to drag it into the component tree

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,490
rather than the design the reason is

30
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,719
it's not like clear as to what's

31
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,060
happening now to show you how you can

32
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,219
arrange the menu options though I'm

33
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,869
gonna place the group between the first

34
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,509
two buttons over here between menu free

35
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,939
and menu paid and you can see that line

36
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,259
there and that's actually showing you

37
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:26,209
where the new item or group group in

38
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,380
this case because that's what I've

39
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,030
selected will appear so I'm going to

40
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,929
release the mouse button

41
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:31,670
and you can see group was actually added

42
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,700
there in the componentry so I've now got

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,740
the group in the wrong place and note

44
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,119
that the group doesn't show in the

45
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,279
design so this is where the component

46
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:42,560
tree is really useful so what you can do

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,090
is you can move items up and down by

48
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,039
just dragging them in the design but

49
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,200
it's actually easy to do that in the

50
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,329
component tree and with a group you've

51
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:52,429
got no choice because it doesn't appear

52
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,229
in the design unless you want to end up

53
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,509
the XML directly of course so what I'm

54
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,249
going to do is drag the group down to

55
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:02,509
the bottom of the component tree notice

56
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:03,859
the horizontal lines that appear where

57
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,079
it can be dropped it basically shows you

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,300
where it's going to appear now gets more

59
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,800
interesting when we have items that can

60
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,360
be nested into other items such as a

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,400
group so I'm going to release that first

62
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,140
put the group in there down the bottom

63
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,239
then I'm going to add two more menu

64
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,290
items to the bottom

65
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,930
the menus right so I'm gonna get a menu

66
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,790
item and I'm gonna drag the first menu

67
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,489
on to the bottom of the component tree

68
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,810
but watch what happens before I let go

69
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,969
so it's natural to aim for the various

70
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,890
elements in the list so that your mouse

71
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,239
pointer will naturally be over to the

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,310
right below group and this in the list

73
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,579
but if I move over to the left still

74
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,629
while keeping the mouse button down

75
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:43,040
notice what happens over to the right to

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,480
the left and to the right you can see

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,519
the little mouse pointer changes over to

78
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:47,930
the right the new menu item will be

79
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,879
dropped inside our group over to the

80
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,889
left it's going to be a peer it's going

81
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:54,379
to basically pee below the group so in

82
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:55,609
other words the guides providing a

83
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,260
visual indication the where the items

84
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,150
are going to end up but this one I'm

85
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,470
going to keep right I'm gonna move over

86
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,000
to the right because we want to put the

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
drop it inside the group and you can see

88
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,129
that we've never got this little one

89
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,959
menu here and the item is actually in

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,930
that group now for the second menu item

91
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,659
I'm gonna select that again and I'm

92
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,489
gonna move down this time I'm going to

93
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,129
keep left so it ends up below the group

94
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:20,959
rather than inside it now that's not

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,280
where I want it but I want to show you

96
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,769
how you can move these items around that

97
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,900
should be easy but let me just drop this

98
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,989
first you can see we've now got one menu

99
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:31,849
item that's in the group and an item

100
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,560
that actually appears outside and it's

101
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,900
actually showing in here as well now it

102
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,449
should be easy to move things around but

103
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,069
to the guides let us down here so a

104
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:41,840
future update might fix this but at the

105
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,470
moment I can't get this bottom item and

106
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,970
drag it into the group you can see it's

107
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,079
not actually working when I try and do

108
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,629
that you can see that the it's really

109
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,040
hard to see but there's an arrow key

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,629
there it's trying to put into the group

111
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:58,400
but it's not actually letting allowing

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,919
me to move anything so the menu deserves

113
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,780
a bit flaky when working with groups and

114
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,909
that's been there's been problems with

115
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,579
it for over six months now and it does

116
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,290
seem to be working okay generally now

117
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,209
with groups but as I said it has been

118
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,370
flaky but if it breaks again you need to

119
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,250
edit the XML so the fix to get this to

120
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,900
work is to click on this little arrow

121
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,239
here to expand it out and now I want to

122
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,699
do that I can drag this into place okay

123
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,669
you can see that's now worked so you can

124
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:27,110
see that to the menu design is a little

125
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,940
bit flaky when working with groups and

126
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,830
there's actually been problems for over

127
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,900
six months

128
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,090
now I seem to be working okay apart from

129
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,800
that model problem which we resolved by

130
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,080
expanding the group but if it breaks

131
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,600
again then you'll need to edit the XML

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,710
so it's worth having a quick look in

133
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,300
there just to get familiar with that if

134
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,790
you need to for some reason go into and

135
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,010
make changes to the XML so I'm going to

136
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,980
click on the text view now what we're

137
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,260
interested in here is this group so

138
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,000
notice the two items are nested inside

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,040
the group there's a group start opening

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,560
tag and the group closing tag and if you

141
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,240
get problems placing items inside a

142
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,730
group just drop them at the bottom then

143
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,350
edit the XML to move them where they

144
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,890
should be

145
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,810
now watch out for the group being

146
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,640
created as a self closing tag when it's

147
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,500
empty so in other words if you saw

148
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,020
something like this I'll just clean up

149
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,810
that on the line first so if you see

150
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,140
something like that like that with the

151
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,870
closing slash there if that happens and

152
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,630
it's perfectly valid for an MP Tatem

153
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,190
e-cell crazy like this and you should

154
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,730
delete the closing slash like so and

155
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,790
then just type in the closing tag itself

156
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,800
this one down the bottom but I'm just

157
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,090
gonna undo everything there and leave it

158
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,200
back to how it was before that's how it

159
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,910
wasn't we got there and we'll go back to

160
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,700
the design alright so I'm going to give

161
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,310
the first of these new menu items the

162
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,210
item the ID rather mini 10 they click it

163
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,090
in the group they're now a menu 10 I'll

164
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,870
call that 1 and the title will be top 10

165
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,800
and for the second one there surprises

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,350
were guessing a menu 25 and top 25 it's

167
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,210
also a good idea to keep the group and

168
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,740
ID so let's go ahead and do that as well

169
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,380
I'm gonna select the group I mean you

170
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,490
will be the ID and when you GRP limit

171
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,980
that's the ID now at the moment these

172
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,870
look just like any other menu items and

173
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,580
there's no way to telling of telling

174
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,770
which ones currently selected what we

175
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,270
really want is for them to behave like

176
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,880
radio buttons so that if one is selected

177
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,070
the others automatically unselected and

178
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,110
we get a visual indication of which one

179
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,180
is being applied to the feet and that's

180
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,430
the purpose of the group here so if I

181
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,050
select the group which it is selected at

182
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,870
the moment in

183
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,120
as you can see I can actually change it

184
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,670
checkable behavior property to single

185
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,710
and that will allow any one of its items

186
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,580
to be selected

187
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,310
now checkable behavior here we've got

188
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,580
options of none all or single and what

189
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,950
we want a single that allows only one of

190
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,130
its items to be selected you can see

191
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,910
what happen when I do that we

192
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,930
automatically got these radio buttons

193
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,930
showing so that's the purpose as a set

194
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,250
of the group here to confirm that only

195
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,590
one can be selected at a time but if we

196
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,070
change this signal to all those that's

197
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,590
now a checkbox there next to the two

198
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,900
items and that would give you the option

199
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,510
of choosing one or two or none but in

200
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,730
our case we want single which allows

201
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,060
only one of them to be selected at time

202
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,170
right so the last thing we need to do

203
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,450
here is we need to have the top ten

204
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,180
option as the default so make sure the

205
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,920
top 10 is selected either here or in

206
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,110
their component tree then we're going to

207
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,520
use the double arrow icon to the top

208
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,240
right to expand the properties pane the

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,610
property one here is checked then these

210
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,800
strange and squares with a dash through

211
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
them a tri-state controls they let you

212
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,680
toggle from on or true to off or false

213
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,900
to default which is what the dash means

214
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,550
they'll just see what that means I'm

215
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,990
going to toggle the checkable property

216
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,020
so what is ticked we get a checkbox next

217
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,220
to the top two so I'm going to click on

218
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,770
that now you can see that we've got that

219
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,170
we click on it again we get a radio

220
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,450
button click on the dash again we get

221
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,910
the default and back again so the tick

222
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,610
gives us the radio button and notice is

223
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,230
a bit of a delay when a ticket between

224
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,930
when it gets updated by clicking it

225
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:27,620
starts off and back to default again but

226
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,150
the one we would want would be checked

227
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,280
and we want that one because that's

228
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,020
going to be the default for this

229
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,520
application so by default it's going to

230
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,860
used to top 10 feeds all right so before

231
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,380
actually writing any code to respond to

232
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,820
these new items I'm going to reformat

233
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,180
the text let's go ahead and do that or

234
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,880
we format code I should say and go back

235
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,910
to the designer so what we'll do is

236
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,370
we'll add the code for these options in

237
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,410
the next video so although they won't be

238
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,660
doing anything we can actually

239
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,829
run the app to make sure that those

240
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:02,019
options appear in the menu let's

241
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,720
actually do it run the app bearing in

242
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,069
mind of course that nothing should work

243
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,560
when we try to tap them because we

244
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,639
haven't written the code or what added

245
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:15,790
the code to do that yet as you can see

246
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,649
in our top 10 is the default and when I

247
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:18,970
click on it nothing happens again

248
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,339
because there's no code but their editor

249
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:24,550
the menu and it's looking good alright

250
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,839
so I'll stop the video here and we'll

251
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,790
add the code to get those working in the

252
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,209
next video
