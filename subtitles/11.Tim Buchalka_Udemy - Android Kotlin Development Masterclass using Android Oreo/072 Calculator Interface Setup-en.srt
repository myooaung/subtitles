1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,399
all right so let's start with the layout

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,709
for the calculator app now we already

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,269
know exactly what it should look like

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,969
because we've seen it running but you

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,469
wouldn't normally get to see a program

6
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:18,020
running before you'd written it now the

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,669
obvious thing to do would be to add the

8
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:21,439
widgets in the order they'll appear on

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,450
the screen but you'll often want to add

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,649
a widget that you hadn't originally

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,680
decided you'd need now to show you how

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,840
the layout designer can handle that what

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,880
I'm going to do is forget that I need to

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,559
enter text widgets and then add the

15
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,050
second one afterwards so as you can see

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,850
on screen I'm in the layout designer and

17
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,520
if you've got the project pane open

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,200
shrink that to make a bit more room and

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,579
you can see that I've already done that

20
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,250
so we want an inner text widget at the

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,710
top of the screen and the data entry

22
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,800
widgets are in the section titled text

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,110
over here which I can click and open and

24
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,400
connect this a little bit just to see a

25
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,340
bit more now Android actually provides

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,079
quite a few widgets for entering data

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,960
including three per entering numbers so

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,420
we've got number number signed as well

29
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,329
as number decimal now our calculator is

30
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,119
going to allow signed decimal numbers so

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,200
we have to choose one of the available

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,810
ones and modify it slightly so we're

33
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,899
going to go with the number signed so

34
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:19,490
we're going to delete near the halliwell

35
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,639
textview so let's do that of course that

36
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:24,350
was created automatically by Android

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,350
studio when the project was created and

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,789
what we're going to do is drag one of

39
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,100
these widgets that number saw into the

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,049
top of the screen now it's going to be

41
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,520
centered eventually so I'm not worried

42
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,079
about where it's going anywhere at the

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,079
top will do for now I'm just going to

44
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,740
put it up the top there you know this is

45
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,299
actually going to store the results of

46
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:46,670
our calculations so I'm going to change

47
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,009
its ID up here making sure that it's

48
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,889
selected which it is change the ID to

49
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:55,219
result press into there and you can see

50
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:56,810
the name is also reflected in the left

51
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,240
under the component tree next we want to

52
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,159
set a top constraint to the top of the

53
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,499
layout and left and right constraints to

54
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,749
the edges before doing that though make

55
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:08,240
sure that the default margins setting is

56
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,250
set to 8 DP you can see over here that

57
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,799
it is set to 8 DP for me if for some

58
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,959
reason that's not change it back to ATP

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,170
and if auto-connect

60
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,560
has

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,030
already created some of the constraints

62
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,380
you can just change the merchants

63
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,569
yourself manually to eight so I'm gonna

64
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,310
go ahead and create the constraint from

65
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,360
the result to the top and also to the

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,770
left and also to the right and we can

67
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,880
see hip here in the top right hand

68
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,010
corner in the inspector that we've got

69
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,989
two other correct margins of eight for

70
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,209
top left and right you know the other

71
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,160
thing you want to do is make sure that

72
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,410
the widgets set to wrap content both

73
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,150
horizontally and vertically and you can

74
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,400
see that's the case over here all right

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,019
no mass I mentioned I'm gonna skip the

76
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:53,000
second edit text widget we're gonna

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,709
start dragging buttons now onto the

78
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,380
design in a rough four by four grid now

79
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,850
there's no point here worrying about

80
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,310
placing them exactly just yet and that's

81
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,330
because all the positioning is

82
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,440
ultimately going to be done using

83
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,709
constraints now if what I connect is on

84
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,299
for you make sure you turn it off at

85
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:09,890
this point and you can see over here

86
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,540
that to my auto connect is off because

87
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,580
I've got the slash showing through or

88
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,290
over the top of the magnet item icon

89
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,269
which of course is the icon for auto

90
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:18,560
connect so making sure that that's

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,290
turned off and I'm doing that because it

92
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,910
doesn't really do the same thing for

93
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,530
each button and I want them to follow a

94
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,880
pattern in the way that they couldn't

95
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,890
their constraints are actually organized

96
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,109
so I'm gonna drag 16 buttons now so

97
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,280
we're gonna click on all either here in

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,530
the pallet and then move over and just

99
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,549
start dragging some buttons again it

100
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:38,720
doesn't matter too much where these

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,910
buttons are because we're going to be

102
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,280
using constraints to actually position

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,260
them exactly so a 4 by 4 green as I've

104
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,000
mentioned

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,180
okay we're halfway there

106
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,220
okay three to go

107
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,320
unless you can see now I've got all of

108
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,850
them on there and a little bit of a

109
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,710
squeeze but again don't worry if they

110
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,150
overlap or don't line up properly

111
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,380
because we are going to be fixing that

112
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,570
and you saw they turned off or don't

113
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,860
connect for that and I really do suggest

114
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,810
that you do that it really doesn't seem

115
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,299
to cope well with a lot of widgets all

116
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,010
right now we want the buttons for the

117
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,350
numbers to be called button 0 to button

118
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,050
9 and if you'd look at the componentry

119
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,450
to the left over here we can see two

120
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,220
things firstly there's this little error

121
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,260
bar peering and it's complaining that

122
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,420
the view isn't constrained and that's

123
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,980
because we haven't got any constraints

124
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,660
because we had auto-connect turned off

125
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,820
as you can see that it has actually

126
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,580
named this button 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

127
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,430
through 216 and that's because the

128
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,320
Android studio automatically appends a

129
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,540
number to the ID when you put more than

130
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,150
one of the same widget on the screen now

131
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,770
you might be tempted at this point to

132
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,110
work systematically up or down the

133
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,460
screen changing the IDs

134
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,350
but you can't set a widget to have an ID

135
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,200
that's already in use now you can of

136
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,270
course do this any time any way you want

137
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,830
but what I'm gonna do is try and change

138
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,290
as few IDs as possible we're gonna make

139
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,870
the button text match the IDS in Android

140
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,300
studio has a side for us so I'm gonna go

141
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,250
ahead and change the first indeed the ID

142
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,680
of the first button button click on that

143
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,720
and I'm going to change the ID that to

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,169
button 0 and I'm also going to change

145
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,640
its text to 0 and the componentry is

146
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,740
very useful for work like this

147
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,510
you know when selecting the buttons at

148
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,680
this stage because at the moment they

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,630
all look the same in the layer all right

150
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,070
so you can see I've changed button zeros

151
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,280
text and ID button 0 and 0 respectively

152
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,840
I'm going to work my way through buttons

153
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,520
2 through 9 in the componentry

154
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,840
giving them the correct text so I'm

155
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,990
going to click on button to change the

156
00:05:43,990 --> 00:06:02,660
text to 2 1 3 3 4 4 5 5 6

157
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:13,680
okay seven eight I have no idea so you

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
can see we've got the buttons 0 2 3 4 5

159
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,410
6 7 8 9 at the moment now we're missing

160
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,330
buttons 1 at the moment Android studio

161
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,509
calls the second button button - but

162
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,880
didn't create a button 1 because when we

163
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,169
added the first button it didn't

164
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,880
actually know there'd be more so what

165
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,259
I'm going to do is change the ID of

166
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,560
button 10 by clicking it you changed

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,470
that to button 1 then we now change the

168
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,389
text to 1 as well okay alright so we've

169
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,880
now got that 10 digit buttons so it's

170
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,889
time to start raising them correctly

171
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,139
now I could do with a bit more room at

172
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,970
the top because 7 is going to go at the

173
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,860
top left of the button grid but there's

174
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,270
not enough room to really place it

175
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,500
without overlapping it's a little bit

176
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,020
tightly now there's no reason you can't

177
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,789
overlap buttons when you're creating the

178
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,860
land but it does make getting to the

179
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,110
constraint handle is difficult so rather

180
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,340
than moving the buttons down

181
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,349
individually though what I can do is

182
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,120
just click just below the book the

183
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,419
bottom right button down here and I can

184
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,639
drag a rectangle out so that it extends

185
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,280
over all the buttons so I'm gonna do

186
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,509
that and there's actually no need to

187
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,509
just to fully enclose a button just any

188
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,210
part of it will select it and if the

189
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,159
rectory at the rectangle includes any

190
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,539
part of one that's going to be selected

191
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,520
so when all the buttons are selected

192
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,440
which you can see that the rectangle is

193
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,580
touching all of them now I'm going to

194
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,680
release the mouse and you can see there

195
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,419
that we've selected all the buttons you

196
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,550
can see that clearly in the blueprint

197
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,370
but also in the component tree so I'm

198
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,570
going to drag them down there just to

199
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,680
make a bit more room for what we're

200
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,169
doing right down towards the bottom and

201
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,909
you can click anywhere in a blank area

202
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,740
of the designer blueprint if you do that

203
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,110
that and selects them or deselect them

204
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,240
you can see that's happened there all

205
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,740
right now to layout the grid

206
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,030
one of the buttons is going to be the

207
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,729
key button no it's that one that's going

208
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,919
to be used to constrain the entire array

209
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,259
of buttons and I'm going to choose

210
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,150
button 7 which is the one that will be

211
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,550
at the top left now you could use either

212
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,770
the button 7 or the slash button the

213
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,790
forward slash which will

214
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,470
at the top right the one that we're

215
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,330
gonna be using for division but we

216
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,640
haven't named that one yet so what I'm

217
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,560
going to do is constrain the top of

218
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,690
button seven to the bottom of the Edit

219
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,880
text widget and then constrain its left

220
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,430
edge to the left edge of the screen so I

221
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,050
do that I'm going to click on this seven

222
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,150
and their submission are going to

223
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,640
constrain it to the bottom of the edit

224
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,960
text widget so I'll do that first and

225
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,070
then I'm going to constrain its left

226
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,420
edge to the left edge of the screen like

227
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,520
so and you can see that it's been placed

228
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,590
automatically once the constraints are

229
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,330
set and that's why I haven't been too

230
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,740
worried about trying to place the

231
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,700
buttons accurately

232
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,320
all right the next thing I'm going to do

233
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,440
is constrain the baseline of but Nate to

234
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,660
the baseline of button seven and the

235
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,880
left edge of button 8 to the right edge

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,130
of button seven now when you're doing

237
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,780
things like that I suggest leaving the

238
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,660
baseline till last if the buttons get

239
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,790
too close together then setting the

240
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,260
constraint or the edge can be very

241
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,450
fiddly now because the baseline

242
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,860
constraint handles are in the middle of

243
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,840
the widgets they're actually much easy

244
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,460
to work with when widgets are close

245
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,890
together so let's do but Nate first I'm

246
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,060
going to do the backlight constraint

247
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,410
from its left edge to the right of

248
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,610
button seven you come button that eight

249
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,820
constrain it to the right of seven as

250
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,430
you can see there now if the display

251
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,690
gets a bit messy which you can see it's

252
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,980
getting a little bit messy from my point

253
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,980
of view now we've got the eight button

254
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,270
overlaying another number

255
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,100
don't worry too much about that that's

256
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,710
okay as long as button eight is selected

257
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,020
which it still is and if for some reason

258
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,340
it isn't remembering you can still

259
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,050
select it from the component tree to the

260
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,450
left I can set a baseline constraint to

261
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,910
button 7 if it gets hard to click on the

262
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,290
constraint handles and you may have to

263
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,120
drag buttons around but it doesn't

264
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,680
really matter how chaotic the display

265
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,780
starts to appear because you'll get more

266
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,370
and more organized as the constraints

267
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,050
are actually created so what I'm going

268
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,390
to do now is come down here and click on

269
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,910
the a B button which opens up the

270
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,440
baseline from straight and then I'm

271
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,810
going to constrain this button eight

272
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,700
baseline from straighten to button seven

273
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,050
so when they click on hold come up and

274
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,550
straight to button seven you can see

275
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,960
it's been moved up for us automatically

276
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,270
and by the way as you finished setting

277
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,780
up the constraints for each but

278
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,610
make sure you do check the margin just

279
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,960
to make sure that they're set to wait

280
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,060
it's easier to do that when the while

281
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,590
the buttons been selected rather than

282
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,150
going back in going through all them

283
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,000
individually later alright so button

284
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
know it has a constraint from its left

285
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
edge to the right of button late so go

286
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,960
ahead and do this I'm going to click on

287
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,760
button 9 and the left edge of button I'm

288
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,840
really constrained to the right edge of

289
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,540
but night you can see that's moved over

290
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,270
for us so you can see that it did move

291
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,890
but it's still selected and again it's

292
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,030
the longest I don't click on anything

293
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,130
else I can turn on the baseline

294
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,750
constraint handle then drag it to the

295
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,370
baseline of bottom right I'm gonna go

296
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:06,940
ahead and do that

297
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,640
turn on the baseline then we constrain

298
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
it tight you can see that moves up and

299
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,220
lastly for us now button for needs a top

300
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,090
constraint to the bottom of button 7 now

301
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,500
it might be tempting Nero to constrain

302
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,150
the left edge button for to the left

303
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,430
edge of the layout really though we want

304
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,410
the entire array of buttons to work like

305
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,110
a single group so if we go constraining

306
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,270
each rotor layout then it would behave

307
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,610
as a single entry so instead what I'm

308
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,900
going to do is constrain the left edge

309
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,570
of button 4 to the left edge of button 7

310
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,270
then set the margin to 0 so it lines up

311
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,400
but let's start firstly with button 4

312
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,470
let me click on that and we want to set

313
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,240
the top constraint to the bottom of

314
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,610
button 7 do that initially then as I

315
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,160
mentioned we're going to constrain the

316
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,080
left edge of button to 4 to the left

317
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,610
edge of button 7 so I'm going to go

318
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,860
ahead and do that and you can see at the

319
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,750
moment looking at this it's got a margin

320
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,420
of 8 but we want to change that margin

321
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,430
to zero so then it lines up directly

322
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,150
under set and of about 97 so I'm gonna

323
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,100
turn it to zero and you can see they're

324
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,900
lining up and looks quite nice

325
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,089
particularly in the design you can see

326
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,589
over here that it's so long that one

327
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,620
looks nice and just to show that the

328
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,610
reason that I've done that if I don't

329
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,680
start dragging button 7 around the

330
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,520
screen so I just click on just button 7

331
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,540
you can see that that's I drag that

332
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,940
around all four buttons are moving now

333
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,740
and that's exactly what I wanted to

334
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,130
happen all right I can just hit that

335
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,220
back to eight now I could have just

336
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,810
changed the margins back to eight

337
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,940
instead of just dragging it back but I

338
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,260
did a combination of both theories you

339
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,620
can see all right now button five needs

340
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,450
a lift constraint to the right of button

341
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,670
four and a baseline constraint to it as

342
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,470
well so let's go ahead and do that so

343
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,190
button five constrain the left first to

344
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,490
the right of 4 and then we're going to

345
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,020
do the same thing we've done before with

346
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,700
other buttons set the baseline before

347
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,400
there it's not lines up there making

348
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,720
sure the margin of eight is still

349
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,450
correct and button six is constrained to

350
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,430
button five in the same way so click

351
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,100
click on six constrain the left edge

352
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,950
first and then we do the baseline

353
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,180
selected at five to put it over to five

354
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,220
as well they were checking that the

355
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,280
margin still eight as well

356
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,020
all right so button one well that's a

357
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,080
repeat of button 4 so it's top is

358
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,790
constrained to the bottom of button 4

359
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,130
and it's left edge to the left edge of

360
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,620
button for with a merchant of zero so

361
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,250
let's do that

362
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,500
so button one constrain the top first

363
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,270
and then as we've done previously for

364
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,720
that for our button for constrain it to

365
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,790
the left edge of that comes off that's

366
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,400
our button and then change the margin

367
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,730
the left margin for button 1 to zero

368
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,010
something that lines up nicely and we

369
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,150
can confirm that things are still

370
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,930
looking ok we can move seven around

371
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,310
click on button 7 we can move it you can

372
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,720
see that everything's moving over moving

373
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,610
nicely and then I can just quickly

374
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,540
change these margins if I want to to put

375
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,280
seven back to cow where it wasn't

376
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,690
consequently all the other buttons mean

377
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,940
as well all right so back to is

378
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,890
constrained to button 1 and button 3 to

379
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,050
button tooth so we need the lifts

380
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,190
constrain to the right of the

381
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,660
destination button in a baseline

382
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,330
constrain as well so let's do that for

383
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,050
buttons 2 and 3 so button to constrain

384
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,900
to the left of button 1 in the baseline

385
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,570
let's try it they're making sure the

386
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,339
margin is set to eight which it is and

387
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:54,250
then lastly button three constrain that

388
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,850
to the right of button of two and set

389
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,690
our baseline constraint as well okay and

390
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,730
the margin you can see in the inspector

391
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,240
is also set to eight so at this point

392
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,830
now we've got a nice group of buttons

393
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,390
that I can drag around it's a single

394
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,180
object again I can just drag them around

395
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,070
you can see that all annoying buttons

396
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,610
are now moving around nicely so again

397
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,680
I'll just change the margins back to

398
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,270
wait so that's sitting in the right

399
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,760
position all right so let's finish the

400
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,620
video here in the next video we've still

401
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,720
got some remaining buttons that need to

402
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,060
be changed and also their text change so

403
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,200
we'll start working on that

404
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,860
in the next video
