00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.700

so if we're going to use a database in

our programs it's important to



2

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.230

understand what a database is now a

database is just an organized collection



3

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.760

of data that can be used to store

information on a computer or on an



4

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.270

Android device or accessed from a web

server over the Internet



5

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.670

now if you have used an android phone or tablet and

if you're watching this as part of my



6

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.530

android course and you certainly will

have android itself uses many databases



7

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.310

to store things like your contact info

text messages and also your browser



8

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.110

history now search history on a browser

is also stored in the database which is



9

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.670

how the Google search on you're phone

knows what you've searched previously



10

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670

and can offer suggestions



11

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.580

anything that stores and retrieves

information can be called a database



12

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.220

these days and the term database

is normally used to refer to more



13

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.220

structured data vendors such as

Microsoft oracle and IBM produced



14

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.240

database management systems based on a

relational database the data is stored



15

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.000

in rows and columns with a row

corresponding to a single record and the



16

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.270

columns representing the fields that

make up a record such as name address



17

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.490

and date of birth in the case of a

person's record or stock number



18

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.420

description and quantity in a stock keeping

application so there's a huge number of



19

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.070

database systems out there probably the

most well-known of the traditional



20

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.560

databases being microsoft sql sequel server

oracle and db2 from IBM now Oracle own



21

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.460

the Java language after buying sun

micro systems but they were originally



22

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.460

created as a database company



23

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.180

so these traditional databases typically

use structured query language shorten to



24

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.850

sql or SQL for performing operations

such as querying and updating the data



25

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.770

but there is now a growing interest in

no sql databases used for storing and



26

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.810

processing big data android includes a

public domain database engine called



27

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.190

sql lite and python includes

support for sql lite databases in the



28

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.450

standard library unlike traditional

database management systems such a



29

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.920

sql server or oracle sql lite is

completely self-contained doesn't



30

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.920

actually need a separate server to run

on



31

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.560

sql lite was designed to be embedded

into systems and originally missile



32

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.730

guidance systems in fact now it uses

the sql language which makes it very



33

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.290

easy to use if you already know a bit

about databases that means that you can



34

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.960

move on to use other sql databases

once you've learned to use sql lite now



35

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.940

sql was developed from Edgar F

Codsworth on relational databases in



36

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.550

the nineteen seventies and became an

ansi standard in 1986 sql lite



37

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.900

implements most of the features of

sql 92 and although they've been 4



38

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.490

revisions of the standard since sql 92 includes everything needed for most



39

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.550

database tasks and interestingly text

messages on iphone are also stored in a



40

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.550

sql lite database



41

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.020

so if you're freaking out about know

of the prospect of having to learn yet



42

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.640

another language don't worry sql

is a language but it's nowhere near as



43

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.110

complicated as java for example in fact

you can do a lot of database work with



44

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.110

only 4 commands select insert update

and delete and you'll see those in there



45

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.980

this section of the course as we work

forward now if you're going to be doing



46

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.390

a lot of database work then you will

need to learn sql more fully than



47

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.230

what we need here and you'll also need

to learn about things like normalization



48

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.160

but the basics that i'm going to cover

will allow you to create programs that



49

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.510

can do basic storage update and retrieval of

information in a database



50

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.450

sql lite has been around since 2008

is a very fast and very stable



51

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.700

standalone database in fact it's the

most widely deployed database engine in



52

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.660

the world is actually close to being the

most widely deployed piece of software



53

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.970

of any kind which is pretty impressive

examples of its use and justification



54

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.270

for that claim that it's the most widely

deployed database engine in the world



55

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.910

are at sqllite.org/mostdeployed.HTML interesting read if you've got



56

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.020

the time and you can also find out more

information about sql lite at that



57

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.410

website click the sql lite logo at

the top of the page to go to the



58

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.960

homepage you can just go to sqllite

.org or you can just type in sql lite



59

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.960

.org / index.html either way it will get you their



60

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.160

alright we're going to first look at

some basic database terminology and



61

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.000

then we are going to move on to use sql lite to create a database and store some



62

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.650

information in that database we need to

understand things like table records and



63

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.000

fields as well as record sets and why

they're important so we'll start by



64

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.370

looking at database terminology in the

next video
