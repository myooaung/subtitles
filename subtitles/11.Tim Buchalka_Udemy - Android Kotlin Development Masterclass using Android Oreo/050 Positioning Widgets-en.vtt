00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.160

So we finished the previous video with a



2

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.500

mini challenge to investigate the effect



3

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.690

that the various scale type settings



4

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.990

have on our image. Now the website that



5

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.580

I'm going to show you now the link is in



6

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.110

the resources section, is that in this



7

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.610

has a very good description of the



8

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.219

different scale types you know from the



9

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:29.960

top of the drop down rather than the



10

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.969

alphabetical documentation first thing



11

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.800

we've got none and that's fairly



12

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.270

straightforward it returns the image to



13

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.400

its default state just as it was just



14

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.740

how it was when we first dropped it on



15

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.070

there but metrics is the tricky one now



16

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070

it uses a metrics to scale the image but



17

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.990

you can't to find a metrics here you



18

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.090

have to do it in code so it's used to



19

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.739

allow the image to be resized and code



20

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.360

when the user pinches it in or out for



21

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.540

example. Now Phoenix y what we'll do is



22

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.190

we'll just go back to android studio now



23

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.560

while we're talking about that so next



24

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.460

one now fit X Y, well that sets up things



25

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.960

have the images scoured in both



26

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.600

directions independently so that it'll



27

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.969

be stretched vertically in this case so



28

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.710

that it fits the current size of the



29

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.869

image view widget so the aspect ratio



30

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.420

won't be maintained so the ball in the



31

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.340

photo doesn't remain circular so let's



32

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.420

have a go at just doing some of these



33

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.850

now sort of chains up to Phoenix Y and



34

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.259

you can see how that was stretched and



35

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.719

the ball doesn't remain circular now at



36

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.219

the size we'll be using here though you



37

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.109

can see that it resembles a rugby ball



38

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.399

or a football on its end now fit



39

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.179

start, so we click on that the aspect



40

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.639

ratio is maintained so both axes are



41

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:42.950

stretched or shrunk by the same amount



42

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.840

and the image is positioned at the top



43

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.659

left of the image view. So image



44

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.459

sorry fit centers the next one by



45

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.560

clicking on that very much like fit



46

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.029

start but the resulting image is



47

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:56.920

centered in the image view and fit end



48

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.779

similarly like fit start but the image



49

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.429

is lined up at the bottom right of the



50

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.349

image view we can try center. Now with



51

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.729

center of the image is centered in the



52

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.340

image view but it's not scaled, so the



53

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.739

edges are cropped off if the image is



54

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.900

too large, so we get the full height of



55

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.120

the image because the image view is 3/8



56

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.470

4 by 4 20



57

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.180

but we lose part of the image off the



58

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.060

left and right edges. Let's try the next



59

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.260

one center crop. Now this scales the



60

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.750

image maintaining the aspect ratio but



61

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.040

we'll make sure that at least one



62

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.680

dimension is at least equal to the



63

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.960

corresponding dimension of the image



64

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.060

view. Now because the height of this



65

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.680

image is the same as the height of the



66

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.170

image view it behaves the same as center



67

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.900

and if the image was a lot narrower it



68

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.610

would have been scaled up and would lose



69

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.460

part of the image at the top and bottom



70

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.520

center inside the image is scaled



71

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.280

maintaining the aspect ratio but no side



72

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.230

will be scaled larger than the image



73

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.540

view so that results in the image being



74

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.610

shrunk so that's about as wide as the



75

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.400

image view so a lot less high with our



76

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.860

image it's the same as fit center but



77

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.540

with an image smaller than the image



78

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.760

view fit center will expand the image to



79

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.650

fill in at least one direction where a



80

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.510

center inside would leave space around



81

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.120

the image. Now if you want to experiment



82

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.340

further create images that are smaller



83

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.680

in both directions and smaller and only



84

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.530

one dimension. Now the third case is



85

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.959

larger in only one dimension and that's



86

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.269

what we have here, there's a fourth case



87

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.239

which is larger in both dimensions and



88

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.010

we can test that without creating a new



89

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.470

image by making the container image view



90

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.090

smaller so let's make it 200 by 200 DP



91

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.880

I'm entering 200 DP in the layout from



92

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.230

width and the same for height 200 DP



93

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.010

that's the course if you want to



94

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.720

experiment with that and once again



95

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.450

looking at two metrics well that's a



96

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.160

little bit boring we can't really do



97

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.959

much with that here and that's because



98

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.910

the metric itself hasn't been defined it



99

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.190

does no scaling so what we can see here



100

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.410

is a 200 square view of the top-left



101

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.510

corner of the image clicking on it like



102

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.780

so and again Phoenix Y shrinks the image



103

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.730

to fit compressing both sides so fin X Y



104

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.560

it compresses both sides to the size of



105

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.450

the image view without caring if it



106

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.979

distorts the image so the ball is no



107

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.350

longer round as you can see here in fits



108

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.140

start fit center and fit end compress



109

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.330

the image to fit and position it in the



110

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.669

top middle or bottom of the image view.



111

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.979

Now the proportions of the original are



112

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.030

maintained



113

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.520

so it won't look distorted we can't see



114

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.750

the entire image in other words, so I



115

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.260

just choose one of those if it starts



116

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.090

you can see that's the case. Now center



117

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.260

just shows the middle of the picture



118

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.370

everything else is cropped off there's



119

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.230

no scaling so we got a sort of 200



120

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.890

square viewport onto the image and sent



121

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.460

a crop again if I select that tools the



122

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.590

imagery was best at Ken but we actually



123

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.200

did lose part on the left and right



124

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.180

edges because we had to crop it off so



125

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.310

the 480 height has been shrunk down to



126

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.830

200 and the 640 width has been shrunk



127

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.840

down by the same percentage leaving it



128

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.720

wider than 200. Now with the sizes that



129

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.610

we're using center inside now behaves



130

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.330

the same as if it's center, you can see



131

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.700

that so with a bit of experimentation



132

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.250

and checking the documentation we've



133

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.600

managed to work out what those dcout



134

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.850

type settings do and the Android



135

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.610

documentation is normally pretty good as



136

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.320

well as reference documentation they've



137

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.120

got tutorial documentation and guides



138

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.430

that tend to explain things from a more



139

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.770

practical angle. Alright so now that



140

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.660

we've seen that I want to take a moment



141

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.820

to demonstrate something that can cause



142

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.340

confusion, but it's not going to cause



143

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.110

confusion here in fact because we're



144

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.660

using an image view. Now an image view is



145

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.729

a very visual component so you'll



146

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.190

understand what's going on straight away



147

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.930

as long as you remember this and apply



148

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.910

it when we start working with text



149

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.860

widgets rather than images everything



150

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.840

will make perfect sense, so the first



151

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.880

thing we need to do is change our scale



152

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.790

type attribute back to fit start so



153

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.830

let's do that, now looking at the



154

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.200

blueprint the image view is perfectly



155

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.600

centered on the screen now because we've



156

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.210

used fit start the image has been



157

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.850

scaled to fit and appears more towards



158

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.669

the top edge of the image view widget



159

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.590

obviously in the designer. Now if we run



160

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:28.400

the app again



161

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.410

the image should appear more towards the



162

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.000

top of the screen, so let's just see what



163

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.360

happens. Now it's roughly centered but



164

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.440

there's definitely more white space



165

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.690

below the image than above and that's



166

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.949

not really surprising but it does



167

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:41.240

demonstrate that there's really two



168

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.610

different things that work here the



169

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.530

first is the positioning of the widget



170

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.600

on the screen centered vertically and



171

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.000

horizontally in this case but the second



172

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.530

is the positioning of the widgets



173

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.960

contents towards the top center of the



174

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.240

widget here so although our widget is



175

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.850

centered vertically the images in



176

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.590

appearing in the center of the screen is



177

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.840

closer to the top of the screen than the



178

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.450

bottom. Now where it can get confusing is



179

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.910

when dealing with text if the text



180

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.770

doesn't fill its widget and won't appear



181

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.350

centered even if the widget itself is



182

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.240

centered and it's slightly worse with



183

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.250

text because text itself can be aligned



184

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.680

to the left or right as well as top or



185

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.840

bottom, so remember that there's two



186

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.310

different things that work here



187

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.350

the position of the widget and the



188

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.389

position of the contents within the



189

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.490

widget. Now we're going to be seeing that



190

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.830

when we start using text widgets but I



191

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.120

wanted to clear up any possible



192

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.760

confusion here when it's very much easy



193

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.160

to understand what's happening and after



194

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.240

what we've just covered you should be



195

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.740

able to work out how to center the image



196

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.590

vertically in the image view. Alright



197

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.419

so let's finish the video here, in the



198

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:45.470

next video we're going to go back to



199

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.150

Android studio and just have a closer



200

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.550

look at that view inspector, so I'll see



201

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.510

you in the next video.
