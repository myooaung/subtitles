00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.319

So I mentioned at the end of the last



2

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.609

video that we were going to create



3

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.379

another project, so I'm going to close



4

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.879

this project by going up to the file



5

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.150

menu and selecting close project and



6

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.169

what we're going to do is create another



7

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.450

project this time based on that other



8

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.939

template the basic activity template.



9

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.619

So I'm going to a click on start new



10

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.020

Android studio project, so once again I'm



11

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.399

going to accept all the default values



12

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.070

for everything and uncheck the include



13

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.200

Cochrane support box but if you're using



14

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.660

Kotlin, this time keep it ticked so we're



15

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.730

going to click on that checkbox now, so



16

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.890

that you can see the difference so click



17

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.900

on next then we're going to go to next



18

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.760

again and then with this time we're



19

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.280

going to choose the basic activity once



20

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.270

we've done that we're going to click



21

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.880

next. So once we get here we get to name



22

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.530

the activity in layout but now this is a



23

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.810

couple of extra options compared to the



24

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.829

last video and we use the empty activity



25

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.360

the title will be shown on the toolbar



26

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.250

and this template adds to the project



27

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.380

but note that the activity name and



28

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.940

layout name are the same as for the



29

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.950

empty activity template, so we're going



30

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.710

to click on finish at this point and



31

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.060

once again Android studio should create



32

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.189

a basic project based on the template we



33

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.289

selected. Now by the way while it's



34

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.759

building the project it's not uncommon



35

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.829

to see errors on the screen but they



36

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.179

should clear when everything is finished



37

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.249

just keep an eye down here in the bottom



38

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.649

right hand corner and the status bar and



39

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.270

don't try to do anything with a project



40

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.020

until it's finished



41

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.909

it'll say something like Gradle build



42

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.459

finished in or words to that effect once



43

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:29.990

it's finished and how long it took when



44

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.639

it's done you can see don't hit the



45

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:34.399

moment it says Gradle build running you



46

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.539

can see down the bottom left hand corner



47

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.179

of Gradle build finished and we're good



48

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.340

to go now by the way you may also see a



49

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.810

message at the top of the screen about



50

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.209

Gradle files haven't changed this



51

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:45.679

happens from time to time with some



52

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.109

Android studio versions so if you do see



53

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.689

that click the sync now button link at



54

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.009

the right hand side as you can see on



55

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.929

the screen there when Android studio is



56

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.700

finished creating the project you should



57

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.439

see main activity and a layout called



58

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.569

content underscore main dot xml we can



59

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.609

see them both on the screen up here now



60

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.139

the layout looks very similar to our



61

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:04.849

empty activity layout from the last



62

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.099

video but there's also a floating action



63

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.860

button down here so we can see at the



64

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.260

bottom right. Now if you feeling chased



65

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.489

hit because the image promised you a



66

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.099

menu don't worry it's there but it



67

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.730

doesn't appear on this layout



68

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.739

now one difference between this template



69

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.900

and the empty activity one is that



70

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.000

Google splits the layouts for each



71

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.629

activity up into two different files,



72

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.040

content underscore main dot xml here is



73

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.050

the one that would be using to put our



74

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.209

own widgets into things like buttons and



75

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.830

text boxes and anything else that we



76

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.170

want displayed on the screen and the



77

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.550

floating action button live in another



78

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.800

file called activity underscore main dot



79

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.510

xml, you notice over here we've got that



80

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.549

file so we double click that to open it



81

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.530

so you can see that the toolbar the



82

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.209

floating action button can be selected



83

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.440

when I click on them so I can click on



84

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.910

something and notice that while I'm



85

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.650

doing that it's selected but if I go



86

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.569

back to content underscore main dot XML



87

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.239

I can't click the floating action button



88

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.860

and that's because they don't exist in



89

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.540

this fall although Android studio does



90

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.670

display the floating action button in



91

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.950

the preview now as I click on the



92

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.720

toolbar and the floating action button



93

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.569

back in activity underscore main those



94

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.069

heather's selected over the far left of



95

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.329

the screen over here in the component



96

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.090

tree and when I click on the main part



97

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.799

of the screen here it selects the



98

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.420

include line which is including the



99

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.819

layout called content underscore main



100

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.230

and you can see that over here to the



101

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.940

right-hand side and this is called the



102

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.310

attributes pane, so the idea is that the



103

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.709

layered is split up to keep your widgets



104

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.480

in a separate file from the toolbar and



105

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.180

the floating action button, if you wanted



106

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.950

to you could delete the include line and



107

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.780

place all your widgets in here but it's



108

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.870

less confusing to keep them separate now



109

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.730

Google introduces separations back in



110

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.220

Android studio 1.5 and that caused



111

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.139

students at the time of some confusion



112

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.850

well they suddenly found two layout



113

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.980

files in their projects now it's



114

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.480

possible that content underscore main



115

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.459

may disappear from the template in a



116

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.200

future version but now that you know



117

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.639

that content underscore main is just



118

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.470

included in activity in the school main



119

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.180

and that you don't have to keep you



120

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.160

widget separate if you don't want to you



121

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.540

shouldn't have any problems if things do



122

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.730

change and incidentally in this version



123

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.859

of Android studio the toolbars blank



124

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.170

even when previewing in it even when



125

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.639

previewing activity underscore main



126

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.190

and that does sometimes happen but if I



127

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.470

run the app the toolbar would appear,



128

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.239

so if you get a blank toolbar in preview



129

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.039

mode don't worry about it it will show



130

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.950

up when the app is running. Alright now



131

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.479

before I finish talking about templates



132

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.520

let's have a quick look at the main



133

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.060

activity file there's quite a bit more



134

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.500

code in this version



135

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.390

than in the empty activity year template



136

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.490

from the previous video but it's all to



137

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.840

do with the setting up on the floating



138

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.570

action button and the toolbar. Now there



139

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.520

are two methods or functions if you're



140

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.780

looking at this in the cotton course



141

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.240

that weren't present before on create



142

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.790

options menu in that on options item



143

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.980

selected now they used to set up the



144

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.610

menu and detect which menu items tapped



145

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.710

also there's code in oncreate to cause



146

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.390

the toolbar to be drawn and to allow



147

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.520

clicks on the floating action button to



148

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.250

be detected now if I don't want all that



149

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.710

I can just delete it. Now in the oncreate



150

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.440

method I'm going to go into there I'm



151

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.940

going to actually delete all but the



152

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.790

first two lines so everything from here



153

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.070

down to the end of the right curly brace



154

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.660

there I'm going to delete look so and



155

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.300

I'm going to delete entirely on create



156

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.820

options menu function and also the own



157

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.820

options items selected so once I do that



158

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.220

we basically end up with the same code



159

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.169

as the previous template would have



160

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.850

given us and by the way you can also



161

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.740

delete activity underscore main I can



162

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.440

come over here right-click and select



163

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.620

delete I can go ahead and ignore those



164

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.070

warnings click on delete anyway and



165

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.840

that's removed activity and let's call



166

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.540

main from this project and then what I



167

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.250

could do is rename content underscore



168

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.410

main to activity in this core main I



169

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.669

come over here and right click that



170

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.320

click on refactor and select rename I



171

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.340

change that to activity now let's call



172

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.570

my XML and click on refactor, now



173

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.280

sometimes you might get an error doing



174

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.979

that on a Mac or a Windows machine if



175

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.960

that happens just right-click and choose copy,



176

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.870

so if the rename didn't go through just



177

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.970

right-click and select copy but the



178

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.860

content owners called main.xml file and



179

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.930

select copy and paste and then choose



180

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.850

activity underscore - the file name and



181

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.470

then you'll be able to delete content



182

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.910

notice called main but in this case you



183

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.180

can see they leave renamed worked ok, so



184

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.320

now that I've done that notice over here



185

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.229

there's this exclamation mark and if you



186

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.660

click on that to show it we've got an



187

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.180

arrow down here I can scroll it up to



188

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.250

have a look at it it's just basically a



189

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.150

warning about the



190

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.070

that the surrounding layout did not



191

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.290

actually include this layout, basically



192

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.730

it's saying it's no longer shown inside



193

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.950

another layout but we don't need to



194

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.270

worry about that at this stage and what



195

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.560

we can do instead is come over here to



196

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.510

the text tab and by clicking on that we



197

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.550

can see the xml for the layout. Now you



198

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.320

don't need to worry about this xml very



199

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.880

often well though it's very helpful if



200

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.530

you select it and paste it all into your



201

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.450

question if you have a problem with a



202

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.420

layout not working what we can do to



203

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.920

remove the error is delete the tools



204

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.120

show in line, this line up here which is



205

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.040

what Android studio is essentially is



206

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.780

suggesting that we actually do so I'm



207

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.130

gonna go ahead and do that delete it



208

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.840

making sure that I'll leave the last



209

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.270

greater than sign there and put that



210

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.280

back in like so if we go back and click



211

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.650

on the design tab now notice if the



212

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.360

error is not valid anymore well we haven't



213

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.820

got a red exclamation mark anymore so we



214

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.500

created a project using the basic



215

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.930

activity template but then we changed it



216

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.340

to be exactly the same as the one



217

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.010

created with the empty activity template



218

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.080

now I don't expect you to remember all



219

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.630

of that nor be able to do it yourself



220

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.790

just yet but by the time you finish the



221

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.920

course all of what we've done will make sense.



222

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.140

So that's templates, they're just



223

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.720

templates generating common code to save



224

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.280

you having to type it but there's



225

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.200

nothing magical about them you're



226

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.570

completely free to make any change you



227

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.520

want to once Android studio is created



228

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.870

the project from the template.



229

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.880

Now if Android studio changes in the



230

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.830

future and temperance were these exact



231

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.210

names are no longer available,



232

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.830

you just want to choose ones that look



233

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.780

similar and you can always delete any



234

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.280

code that doesn't appear in the videos



235

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.470

or add any code that I have in the video



236

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.710

but which is missing from the template.



237

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.030

Alright so let's move on to the next



238

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.590

video where we're going to start coding



239

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.020

up our first app. See you in the next video.
