1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,610
Google of Neil made Kotlin of top-level

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,110
language for Android development which

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,090
means that it's fully supported in

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,519
Android studio and they'll also be

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,920
publishing example code using Kotlin as

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,080
well as Java at the moment though most

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,689
of their code samples are still in Java

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,579
now turns out that's not a huge problem

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,009
because we kind of look in this section

10
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:29,950
of how Android studio can convert Java

11
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:31,930
code to Kotlin for us so in this section

12
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,910
we're going to look at the Kotlin

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,040
programming language just to give you an

14
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,110
overview and introduction to it so let's

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,270
get started now Android studio is

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,550
designed for Android development which

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,590
means that the projects it creates are

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,810
intended to be run on an Android device

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,520
and not on your computer now it is

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,850
possible though to get Android studio to

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,920
compile and run pure Kotlin code it is

22
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,800
very fiddly so we've created a project

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,079
for you this that Android studio

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,630
projects been specifically configured to

25
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,970
run pure cotton code that will run on

26
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,320
your computer now before I show you how

27
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,360
to get that working there's another

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,179
alternative now if you're already using

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,490
IntelliJ as your IDE and I recommend

30
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:15,369
using that for these tutorials instead

31
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:18,130
now Android studio is based on IntelliJ

32
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:21,069
IDEA so everything will work just as is

33
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,990
in the videos now you may also be taking

34
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:25,119
Sarah at ratures Kotlin for Java

35
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,700
developers course in which case you'll

36
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,859
see how to install IntelliJ IDEA in that

37
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,240
course for everybody else that I'm going

38
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:34,899
to go through the steps to get Android

39
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,209
studio to run pure Kotlin code now the

40
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:39,579
project we've created is in a zip file

41
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:41,499
in the resources section of this video

42
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,869
so let's just move over now and I'm

43
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:45,850
going to show you how to get that sim

44
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:48,150
phone how to unzip it and get it ready

45
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,520
for use on your computer

46
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,130
all right so the project we've created

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,200
is in a zip file in the resources

48
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,670
section of this video and this is the

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,070
file that so we're going to be using for

50
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,420
our Kotlin tutorial and if you move the

51
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,070
mouse over the video

52
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,170
a pop up balloon will appear at the top

53
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,420
left and just above that you'll see a

54
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,190
menu icon and if you click on that and

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,890
scroll down to this video in the list

56
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,420
you'll actually see an area where you

57
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,190
can download the file and the file that

58
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,990
you want is called Kotlin tutorial does

59
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,340
it so you can check that out and

60
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,620
download that file because we'll need

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,540
that file to actually work on these

62
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,220
tutorials there Kotlin tutorial if

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,530
you've got any problems finding the

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,820
Kotlin tutorial file just look in this

65
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,680
lecture of the lecture that you're

66
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,940
looking at now basically just go into

67
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,640
the top left of the screen and you

68
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,410
should see a resources section but also

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,670
the last lecture of the course has got a

70
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,470
list of all the downloads so you can

71
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,090
grab it from there as well and what you

72
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,430
need to do is download for that file

73
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,530
Kotlin cheeto road of zip and put it

74
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,090
somewhere on your computer and you can

75
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,370
see in my case I want a mac and I've

76
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,770
downloaded into a folder once you've

77
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,870
done that you need to unzip it now in my

78
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,209
case of a Mac I can just double-click

79
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,690
the file to unzip it and you can see it

80
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,860
creates a subfolder now if you're on a

81
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,180
Windows machine or Linux machine you

82
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,170
most likely have to right-click that

83
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,720
file and select expand all or uncompress

84
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,030
or words to that effect and expand that

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,590
directory out and make a note of where

86
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,350
that directory is because we'll need

87
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,280
that when we go back to Android studio

88
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,820
alright so let's go back to Android

89
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,970
studio now alright so now that we've

90
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,430
downloaded and unzipped the Kotlin

91
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,860
tutorial files next step is to open it

92
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:32,850
in Android studio so click on open an

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:34,709
existing Android studio project you want

94
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,320
to navigate to the folder where the file

95
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,670
has been unzipped in my case it Scotland

96
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,299
tutorial so I'm going to double click on

97
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,400
that to open it and click on open now

98
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,049
Android studio will load the project and

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,600
it may take quite a while the first time

100
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,280
while it builds the project on Windows

101
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,670
in particular be prepared to wait about

102
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,170
a minute before the project fully loads

103
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,850
and the wallets loading you may get an

104
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,310
error like this or a warning like this

105
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,370
basically saying that the path and

106
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,200
whatever the path is that we've

107
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,390
actually used to create the zip file

108
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,909
doesn't belong to a directory just click

109
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,799
OK to that and Android shit is then

110
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,590
going to use the setup or configuration

111
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,129
that you've done in your version of

112
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,129
Android studio

113
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,400
all right so Neal got the project open

114
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,870
in Android studio now you may actually

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,150
be asked if you want to upgrade the

116
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,880
version of the Kotlin plug-in or Gradle

117
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,130
used by this project so if you do get

118
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,870
asked that don't do it now we normally

119
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,570
suggest that you accept all the updates

120
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,880
Android studio offers but don't update

121
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,290
anything in this particular project the

122
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,690
reason is that we spent a lot of time

123
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,510
hacking the Gradle files around to make

124
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,850
this work updating Google or the Kotlin

125
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,380
plugin will break those changes now if

126
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,820
that happens the program won't compile

127
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,680
you'll need to delete the project

128
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,290
directory and extract it from the zip

129
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,350
file again alright so if you look up

130
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,550
wrote the project open in Android studio

131
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,500
now the main part of the window is the

132
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,229
edit window which is currently empty

133
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,120
that's as part here and it shows some

134
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,220
useful lost shortcuts but there's no

135
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,260
file displayed because we're not editing

136
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,830
anything yet over to the left here is

137
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,720
the project panel or project pane and it

138
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,160
shows the files making up our project

139
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,520
and at the moment we're only interested

140
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,660
in what main dot katie's over here so so

141
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,010
just before we go into there I'm going

142
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,010
to explain briefly what these other

143
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,330
things so the Gradle scripts folder that

144
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,860
heading there contains various

145
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,270
configuration options for the Gradle

146
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,190
build system so I can open that up then

147
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,080
have a look there now granel's

148
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,570
responsible for things like compiling

149
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,360
our Kotlin code and producing the

150
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,860
executable that we can run it's great or

151
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,560
that we had to change to get Android

152
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,479
studio to cope with plain cotton rather

153
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,490
than the Android project structure that

154
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,690
was designed for now we're going to be

155
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,700
looking at a couple of the files in

156
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,889
there later but for now you can safely

157
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,389
ignore everything in this section now

158
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,669
the top of the project pane is our

159
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,710
project Kotlin cheetor which you can see

160
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,389
highlighted and expanding that if you

161
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,789
haven't already and again it should be

162
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,740
it shows a job a subfolder here so you

163
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,960
can see and I know this is a Kotlin

164
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,090
course but historically everything was

165
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,220
written in Java so consequently

166
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,919
Android studio once that directory to be

167
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,030
called Java now below that is the Kotlin

168
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,770
source code file we're going to be

169
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,050
creating more of these but the moment

170
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,390
there's only the one Kotlin file in the

171
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,060
project and by the way it's possible to

172
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,610
mix Java and Kotlin source code in the

173
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,319
same project and if you do that

174
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,719
the Java files will have a dot Java

175
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,240
extension and the Kotlin files will have

176
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,789
a dot Katy extension as you can see in

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,590
this example here now to edit a file you

178
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:44,330
just need to double click it so we can

179
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,449
open main by double clicking it there

180
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,219
which I'm going to do mundo Katie that

181
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,189
shows some cotton code on the screen

182
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:53,719
there now this is a very simple Kotlin

183
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:55,879
program and we're going to be going

184
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:58,250
through what it all means shortly for

185
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,710
now though we have to get it working now

186
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,449
let's try running the program now it

187
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,460
turns out there's four different ways to

188
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,930
do that and they all do the same thing

189
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:10,909
now we could go to the run menu up here

190
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,789
you click on and select run Katie and

191
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:16,939
run main Katie we can also right click

192
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:19,219
on the entity here and choose run main

193
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:21,889
Katie there from the context menu

194
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:24,289
now by the way sometimes the menu

195
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:26,360
doesn't appear there but it does when

196
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,860
you right click on main dot Katie in the

197
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,139
project pane same I need to click on

198
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,960
that right click and run

199
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,029
main Katie there to get it to show the

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,089
fourth way to run is to use this green

201
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:40,219
triangle in the toolbar now what that

202
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:41,539
does can vary and the drop-down list on

203
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:42,830
its left will tell you what it's going

204
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,719
to run so you can see over here it's

205
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,960
telling you it's gonna be running main

206
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:49,759
Katie so in other words it's set to main

207
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,610
Katie so it's going to run our main or

208
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,870
our current Kotlin file but watch out

209
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,490
for that because we're gonna be using

210
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,589
different files as we work through these

211
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,870
videos so keep an eye on what it says

212
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,360
over here in that Dropbox to make sure

213
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,409
that you're running the correct file

214
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,969
alright so we've got four different ways

215
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:07,189
to run this program but none of them

216
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:09,349
will work as I said we had to hack

217
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:11,599
around with the project files to get

218
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,520
this to work with Android studio but

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,310
there's one final step we couldn't get

220
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,289
past so use any one of these four

221
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,969
methods and run the program in my case

222
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going to right click via main duct

223
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:26,439
Katie over here in the project pane and

224
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,439
she's run Katie from there

225
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,910
now the prototype will be built as it

226
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,560
was there but you'll actually get an

227
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,990
error and you can see this error could

228
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,450
not we'll find or load main class main

229
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,280
Katie now this will only happen the

230
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,690
first time we try this so just follow

231
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,880
along and run the program and you'll get

232
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,890
the error like I've got here now once

233
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,120
that's happened and you see the error as

234
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,480
you can see in the screen there could

235
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,570
not find the load class main Katie go to

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,250
the build menu up here and click on

237
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:58,620
rebuild project then when you do that

238
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,050
nothing really seems to happen but now

239
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,600
the project will run using any of the

240
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,190
four methods now it's a tradition that

241
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,870
the first program you write in a new

242
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,330
language should print HelloWorld and

243
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,680
that's what this program does so let's

244
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,960
try running I don't think I do the same

245
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,230
way try and run at the same way select

246
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,820
run main Katie and you can see in this

247
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,010
case now that we've done that we're

248
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,560
successfully getting the text to output

249
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,840
on the screen hello world all right so

250
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,670
that's our project set up and working

251
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,890
then we're going to use this same

252
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,950
project throughout these tutorial videos

253
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,390
and add new files as we go along as you

254
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,520
start each new video make sure you've

255
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,520
got this project open in Android studio

256
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,410
and again as a recap the reason we've

257
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,930
done all this is because it's much

258
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,300
easier to explain Kotlin where we can

259
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,770
just run our programs directly rather

260
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,200
than having to run them as an Android

261
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,240
app in an emulator now there are two

262
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,700
ways to close the project if you just

263
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,760
close the Android studio using the close

264
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,590
that icon at top left up here or top

265
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,020
right on windows then the project will

266
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,180
open again automatically the next time

267
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,060
you start Android studio personally I

268
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,060
prefer to go to the file menu and clue

269
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,610
and choose close project first so we

270
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,050
need to that Android studio starts up on

271
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,480
the welcome screen as you can see here

272
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,430
but it also remembers the last projects

273
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,550
you've opened so you come over here and

274
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,800
click on Kotlin tutorial in the list to

275
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,030
open the project again

276
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,070
alright so we're all set up now so I'm

277
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,780
going to stop the video here and in the

278
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,910
next video we'll start looking at the

279
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,500
Kotlin language and what we can do with

280
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,500
it see you in the next video
