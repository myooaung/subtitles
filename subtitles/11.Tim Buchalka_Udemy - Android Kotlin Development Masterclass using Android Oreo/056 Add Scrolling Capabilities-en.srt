1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,129
Alright so we've still got the image

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,500
to add but before doing that let's run

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,200
the program and see how it behaves and

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,849
that'll also give us a chance to see how

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,640
the layout and the code work together.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,840
Now what we need to do though is make a

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,090
change to the code so expand the project

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,340
pane if it's not open we want to come

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,960
down here and make sure that we're in

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,329
the Java folder because if you recall

11
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,700
the Java folder contain the source files

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,160
which ultimately contain our code we're

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,079
going to open up the package in this

14
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,579
case Academy don't learn programming

15
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,469
directivity and there's this main

16
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,360
activity you know there's only the one

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,010
class here at this time but in more

18
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,170
complicated apps you'd see that there

19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,329
would be a lot more classes so I'm going

20
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,680
to double click that now to open loop

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,880
and in main activity the layer is used

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,100
by this setcontentview statement on line

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,620
10 and that tells the app which layout

24
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,200
to use when it runs now I guess that's a

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,420
slight oversimplification but so with

26
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,760
any one class that's totally accurate so

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,280
instead of using our layout dot activity

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,470
underscore main we need to change that

29
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,780
to our dot layout got note under School

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,880
layout to use the layout until we've

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,380
been working on and just created in the

32
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,749
previous video so I'm going to delete

33
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:17,840
that and I'll just tap press the period

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,999
or dot and notice when I've done that

35
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,880
we've automatically got an option here

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,200
Android studio knows which layouts are

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,969
available in your project and it's

38
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,649
suggesting the note layout literally

39
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:29,539
silicide entered that period or type

40
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:32,240
that period and sometimes it doesn't do

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,709
it that quickly if you type the first

42
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,479
few letters of the layout you're looking

43
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,119
for it'll find it in the drop-down and

44
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,159
obviously using a drop-down is more

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,009
convenient because it saves typing but

46
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,509
also help you to guard against hopping

47
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,219
errors so instead of typing but allow

48
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,319
them just going to press into there all

49
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,609
right so that's really the only change

50
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,170
we need to make it this time to the code

51
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,539
so we've told the app now which layout

52
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,829
to use when it runs so I'm going to

53
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,810
close down the Kotlin class and I'm

54
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,539
going to close the project pane again

55
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,889
I'm going to make sure that no times

56
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,749
called layout select it again which it

57
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:06,740
is and let's just run that to see what

58
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,869
it looks like.

59
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,900
Alright so there's the app running.

60
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,250
Now it doesn't look too bad at all although

61
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,080
I still need to change the text in the

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,659
text view in the top right hand corner

63
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,670
but there is a problem though and it'll

64
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,170
become a parent as soon as I'll start

65
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,519
trying to type something into the other

66
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,459
text but firstly when I click in the

67
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,250
edit text you can see the on-screen

68
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,409
keyboard appears and things gonna be

69
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,870
wrong then the keyboard is partially

70
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,269
obscuring the edit text so I can't

71
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,500
actually get to the end I can try

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
scrolling so I'm trying to scroll

73
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,780
simulating like a scroll but I can

74
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,220
actually get to the end of the text you

75
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,510
can see it's sort of just jumping around

76
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,670
and just generally not quite working correctly

77
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,069
no no not I really allowing us to get to

78
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,099
the end now this might appear to be two

79
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,609
problems but the cause is the same so I

80
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,230
can't scroll the text right to the end

81
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,239
and I can also can't add any more text

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,769
to the end for that reasons I can't get

83
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:04,159
down there to do that but as it happens

84
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,420
fixing that issue also prevents the

85
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,220
keyboard from obscuring the edit text

86
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,290
widget and that's really the real cause

87
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,659
here now one thing I want to point out

88
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,010
though is that I can't give you all the

89
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,889
answers I can show you a good variety of

90
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,230
layouts in this course but I can't

91
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,790
predict every layout that you want to

92
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,650
create in your own apps nor how they'll

93
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,150
have to interact with things like the

94
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,310
keyboard what I will do is try and show

95
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,440
you as many potential problems as I can

96
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,260
such as this one here and I will also

97
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,760
look at different ways to get the same

98
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,220
effect by changing the constraints we

99
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,200
use but it's important that you really

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,609
get the hang of the layout design

101
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,579
yourself and also important what is

102
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,169
important to think about your layouts

103
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,959
not us fix things but more as fluid

104
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,209
designs that move around if the user

105
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,730
does things on the phone or tablet now

106
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,799
this layout is a great example of one

107
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,019
that looks good in theory but falls over

108
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,280
slightly in practice

109
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,230
so let's actually see what we can do

110
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,549
about it so I'm just going to go back

111
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,329
into Android studio now now I've clicked

112
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:04,829
on edit text all was already selected

113
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,560
anyway one thing to notice here is that

114
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,079
it's set to be centered vertically in

115
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,870
the available space now that doesn't

116
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,910
really make sense here it should really

117
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,310
always be positioned at the top just

118
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,829
below the title and then grow downwards

119
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,019
as it needs to so I need to set the

120
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,580
vertical bias to zero

121
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,889
and that's the same is true for the

122
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,440
horizontal bias now it's visually

123
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,240
obvious which way you need to go so I'm

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,509
going to drag the vertical bias to the

125
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,069
top as I mentioned and set that to zero

126
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,370
and also I'm going to drag the

127
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,590
horizontal slider to the left as well to

128
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,770
make that zero so now we've got both the

129
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,539
vertical and horizontal biases set to

130
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:48,569
zero now we do get questions about what

131
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:51,120
difference this makes and often it

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,129
doesn't make any difference with less

133
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,289
text and the layout underscore height or

134
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,940
layer and let's go a width set to wrap

135
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,770
content it will however make a

136
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,599
difference but that's actually got

137
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,060
nothing to do with our problem so what

138
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,190
we need to do is to make the edit text

139
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,550
scrollable vertically now the edit text

140
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,560
could already be scrolled but without

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,539
the scroll bars actually being set the

142
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,190
layout doesn't collapse it out of the

143
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,560
way of the keyboard so to turn on the

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,870
vertical scroll bar what we need to do

145
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,960
is expand the full set of properties and

146
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,400
we do this by clicking on these two

147
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,680
little arrows up here in the inspector

148
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,870
and then we're going to search through

149
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,550
the large the alphabetical list until we

150
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,800
find the scrollbar setting now remember

151
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,150
that your might need to use this cog

152
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,969
over here to select all that jeebies so

153
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,949
if I click on that and you might be in

154
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:40,050
that mode there so if you see that a

155
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,219
mode that looks similar to that just

156
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,419
come back here and click on all

157
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,539
attributes table and you'll get to the

158
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,219
right view all right so let's scroll

159
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:52,310
down now, so we can see this scrollable attribute

160
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,160
there's scrollbars you know spared that

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,440
as you can see and we want to set that

162
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,300
to vertical so I'm going to click on

163
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,760
vertical you can see it updates over

164
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,400
here now now we're also going to set the

165
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,840
scroll indicators that stays a little

166
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,240
bit further up which I'll expand and

167
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,010
we're doing that to provide a visual cue

168
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,010
that the contents are scrollable now we

169
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,600
want to click over here come over here

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,750
and click on right select that and also

171
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,250
end and you can see that though we've

172
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,070
got both selected now now start and end

173
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,160
properties were introduced in API 17 and

174
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,990
they're designed to provide the expected

175
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,580
behavior with the languages that are

176
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,800
written from right to left Arabia can

177
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,080
person for example so but you think

178
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,390
start instead of left and end instead of

179
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,640
right you're allowing your app to cope

180
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,130
with right-to-left languages now if

181
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,930
you're targeting Android versions prior

182
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,050
to API 17 as we are then you should also

183
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,510
set a left or right as well so that

184
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,150
those earlier versions also work now the

185
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,220
scroll indicators provide a visual

186
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,680
indication that a widget can be scrolled

187
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,140
and also indicate how far through the

188
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,420
contents you've already scrolled so note

189
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,420
that they were introduced in API 23 sets

190
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,770
wouldn't have any effect on early

191
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,930
versions of Android all right so now

192
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,090
that we've enabled scrolling the enter

193
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,830
text widget should be scrollable so

194
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,620
let's run the app again to test that but

195
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,060
first I'm going to change the text in

196
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,250
the text view to constraint layout so

197
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,380
I'm just going to click over here and

198
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,580
we're going to close down this mode and

199
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,380
go back to our normal mode and let's

200
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,450
change the text there and we'll call it

201
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,450
two constraint layout so notice how the

202
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,430
width of the edit text changes and

203
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,200
that's because it's constrained to the

204
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,080
right-hand edge of the textview and keep

205
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,730
in mind also that sometimes it takes a

206
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,830
little while for the blueprint to update

207
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,440
after a change like this so that causes

208
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,940
the other text to become narrower

209
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,440
because it's constrained to the

210
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,810
right-hand edge of the textview.

211
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:58,230
Alright so let's try running the program again

212
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,780
so now that I've run it again Android

213
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,340
Studios instant run will install the

214
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,290
changes and restart the application and

215
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,390
that's actually quite a nice feature

216
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,070
that first appeared in Android studio

217
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,010
1.5 now it could cause a few problems

218
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,530
with apps not restarting but the bugs

219
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,410
seem to have been ironed out now and it

220
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,820
makes the whole process of testing

221
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,500
changes a lot faster than it used to be

222
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,420
so you can see here now we've got a

223
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,130
different layout there well it looks

224
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,600
different now because we've added the

225
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,820
scroll the scrolling capability you can

226
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,470
see that the app is now functioning

227
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,850
different to what differently to what it

228
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,040
was before firstly we know automatically

229
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,169
at the bottom you can see the bottom of

230
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,410
the edit text and also the keyboard is

231
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,229
now not obscuring the text and I should

232
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,910
be able to scroll up and down now you

233
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,200
can also see over here if you look

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,450
carefully the visual representation of

235
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,270
us scrolling up and also where we are in

236
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,700
the text so that's all working nicely now

237
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,560
against you sir I can get right down to

238
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,290
the bottom as well now keep in mind as I

239
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,820
mentioned it's scrollable and you saw

240
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,530
that it was scrollable and the scroll

241
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,910
indicators are appearing on the right

242
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,160
but those scrolling indicators only will

243
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,540
appear on devices running Android

244
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,330
marshmallow or later now it still can be

245
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,920
scrolled in all versions but it's only

246
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,200
the indicators that don't appear and

247
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,580
again scrolling the text of the edit

248
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,410
text also fixed the other problem we had

249
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,180
and you can see now that so we can

250
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,830
scroll right to the end of the text and

251
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,700
I can actually add more timwas here if I

252
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,830
so desire alright so there's just the

253
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,200
image to add now so what we want to do

254
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,530
is go back to Android studio and we want

255
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,750
to drag an image view onto the left of

256
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,960
the design just below the title so we

257
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,150
come over here and click on images image

258
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,860
view and we're just going to put that

259
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,260
just below the title don't put it about

260
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,370
there and what we want to do is because

261
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,260
that's come up automatically is you want

262
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,280
to select the ball underscore 100 by 100

263
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,520
so like that okay then we want to

264
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,380
constrain the top of the image view to

265
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,910
the bottom of the text view so let's do

266
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,580
that first

267
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,780
there the left edge of the image view

268
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,550
should be constrained to the left edge

269
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,800
of the screen and the right edge of the

270
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,330
image view should be constrained to the

271
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,060
left edge of the init text widget so

272
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,260
let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna

273
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,290
we can see that in this case the left

274
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,670
constraint has already been added so if

275
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,620
yours hasn't been added didn't do that

276
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,420
but we also want to constrain as I

277
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,950
mentioned the right edge of the image

278
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,350
view to the left edge of the editing so

279
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,760
I can go ahead and do that now the other

280
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,470
thing to do is also make sure that the

281
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,600
layout width is set to match underscore

282
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,300
con constraint otherwise the image may

283
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,620
run off their left edge of the screen

284
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,330
and you can see at the moment I've got

285
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,280
that set to wrap content so I'm gonna

286
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,080
change layout width for set to match

287
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,510
constraint all right so let's actually

288
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,630
run the app again and see how it behaves

289
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,010
you can see that it's gonna move that

290
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,690
over a little bit that looks pretty good

291
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,390
and you can see that we've got our text

292
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,890
there we can still scroll that up and

293
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,640
down I can hide the keyboard

294
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,640
and see more of the edit text now and

295
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,230
that's still looking good so let's just

296
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,670
move that over to landscape and have a

297
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,540
look so any landscape and by the way you

298
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,010
should always test your layouts in both

299
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,930
portrait or landscape as well as on a

300
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,519
range of different devices such as a

301
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,860
phone and a tablet so you can see that

302
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,329
it looks pretty good in portrait and

303
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,519
landscape now the two buttons on the

304
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
side of the emulator by the way lets you

305
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,480
rotate the device as you saw me click so

306
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,740
I can go back and click it the other way

307
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,959
go back to portrait again it really

308
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,269
makes a great way to easily test layouts

309
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,920
without having to run it on a physical

310
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,350
Android device all right so that's the

311
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,180
end of our introduction to the layout

312
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,740
designer that Google have produced for

313
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,019
Android studio now we've actually

314
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,180
covered quite a lot including some of

315
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,070
the widgets available and how to place

316
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,529
them on the design now we also saw how

317
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,570
to use constraints to make sure that the

318
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,269
widgets appear where we want them even

319
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:58,360
when screen size and orientation change

320
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,860
now we've covered the different types of

321
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,810
constraint and how they affect the

322
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,490
behavior of widgets that are constrained

323
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,220
to each other now the inspector is very

324
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,350
useful and we've seen how to use that to

325
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,870
change the sizing of widgets as well as

326
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,000
their position within the constraints

327
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,769
the margins and the vertical and

328
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,110
horizontal sliders can also be used to

329
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,110
set the bias from the inspector Google's

330
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,880
aim with this new layout designer was to

331
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,440
make it possible to do everything you

332
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,990
need to do without having to edit xml

333
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,209
and i'd say they've largely succeeded

334
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,459
there is one time when you definitely

335
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,890
need to view their xml though now you've

336
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,660
noticed that just put this back on the

337
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,510
screen neither the blueprint norther

338
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,310
design make it easy to check all the

339
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,560
constraints at once and there's no way

340
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
to display all the properties on the

341
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,370
screen at once not unless you cut out

342
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,680
three meter higher screen so if you have

343
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,899
problems with a layout and want to post

344
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,060
a question about it a screenshot alone

345
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,589
will probably not help us to work out

346
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,990
what's going on in that case if you do

347
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,880
want help with a layout that's not doing

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,480
what you want

349
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,360
please select all the XML and paste it

350
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,490
into your question that way we can see

351
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,930
everything that's said in it and they're

352
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,339
gonna be coming back to that later and

353
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:08,990
give you some tips to make you know and

354
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,209
make it easy to compare your XML with

355
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,520
mine all right so that's the end of this

356
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,529
video in the next one what we're going

357
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,940
to do is create an app that does more

358
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,490
than just display things on the school

359
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,510
we'll get it so that clicking a button

360
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,000
actually does something. I'm gonna stop

361
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,710
that up with a challenge though just to

362
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,270
warn you the next video will start with

363
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,190
a challenge to design the layout that

364
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,930
we're going to be using in the app.

365
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,400
So I'll see you in that next video.
