00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.880

all right so we've now got an app that



2

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.070

can display information from an RSS feed



3

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.650

and we've customized the display by



4

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.530

creating our own custom adapter now at



5

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.630

the moment it only displays the same



6

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.240

feed now that's still useful because you



7

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.220

can quickly check the feed to see what's



8

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.470

changed but it would be better if we



9

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.790

could choose from a list of fees and



10

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.759

display any of them when we wanted to so



11

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.349

to do that we're going to create a menu



12

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.020

for our app so the focus of the next few



13

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.059

videos is going to be how to work with



14

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.670

Android menus now before I start with



15

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.590

the menus though I want to clean up our



16

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.330

log cut a bit then we're going to be



17

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.100

using it to see what's going on but at



18

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.360

the moment it gets some you know a bit



19

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.710

full of the data that we're downloading



20

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.320

and parsing now that we've established



21

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.820

that that all works we're not going to



22

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.590

need to keep that logging and all that



23

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.840

information and by the way that's



24

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.670

something that you'll do as a developer



25

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.740

you'll lock parts of your code and once



26

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.900

it's all working you'll comment out or



27

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.970

remove entirely the logging and add it



28

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.220

in other places that stops the lock from



29

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.680

getting huge and hard to navigate all



30

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.820

right so what I'm going to look at is



31

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.210

our past applications class and I'm



32

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.530

going to comment out the logging code



33

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.289

for the starting and ending tags and if



34

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.670

we have a look here we've got paths



35

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.429

starting let's comment that out online



36

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.969

now 33 it also down here where it's



37

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.859

ending it's a comment that out on line



38

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.189

42 as well and let's also have a look at



39

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.670

the for loop and that'll be on line 60



40

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.079

where are we 65 here let's actually



41

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.810

comment out the logging for that it's



42

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.100

much more common at the whole loop



43

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.420

because it was only really there to log



44

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.969

things so we'll come at those four lines



45

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.600

out line 65 three lines 68 all right so



46

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.170

let's go back to main activity now and



47

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.450

what we want to do is have a look at our



48

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.450

on post execute method here and we've



49

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.850

already committed that out by the looks



50

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.659

so I'm just going to actually delete



51

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.090

that line I'll just make sure that that



52

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.469

is commented out clever no longer need



53

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.469

any logging about that and the other



54

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.479

thing to note here is just to clean up



55

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.660

have a look in your imports there in my



56

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.510

case it's already removed but if you



57

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.130

haven't got Android studio set up to do



58

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.510

this automatically you want to remove



59

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.740

the ANU



60

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.160

arrayadapter important thought that says



61

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.480

android app widget dot arrayadapter



62

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.100

and again in my case it's been removed



63

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.110

because I've got Android studio set up



64

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.600

to automatically remove unused imports



65

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.850

when came back to that code in



66

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.670

onpostexecute again alright so



67

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.720

onpostexecute on post execute looking at



68

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.160

that again the other thing we want to do



69

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.230

i commented out these cut these two



70

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.750

lines here in the previous video



71

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.010

relating to the older aid tap type i'm



72

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.300

going to delete them completely now



73

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.040

because we've got a copy of that in the



74

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.650

previous videos source code and in the



75

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.000

feed adapter class let's remove the



76

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.950

logging for that as well and we can



77

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.240

actually remove the tag as well because



78

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.580

we're no longer going to be using that



79

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.050

and the advantage of doing it that way



80

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.960

is once i remove that line it makes it



81

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.030

quite easy for us to find any logging



82

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.560

because it's the whole I didn't read as



83

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.550

you can see so I'm gonna go ahead and



84

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.680

delete that I think it's now using tag



85

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.000

from another class now in case you're



86

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.160

wondering why the have read there has



87

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.720

disappeared but will remove all those



88

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.440

logging in trees and that should be it



89

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.960

anyway okay so that's the changes to



90

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.290

health feed adapter and check your write



91

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.840

imports at the top I don't need to do



92

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.430

anything here because again I've got



93

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.680

mine set phone to automatically



94

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.780

reconfigure and used in ports but there



95

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.460

might be an Android dot util the log



96

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.230

entry you can there delete as well in



97

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.860

the imports alright so creating menus in



98

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.330

previous versions of Android studio



99

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.780

before version 2.2 involve topping in



100

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.810

the XML but with version 2.2 Google



101

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.120

included a menu designer and that's



102

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.440

actually still available in Android



103

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.600

studio 3 so let's actually see how it



104

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.170

works so we're going to open up our



105

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.540

resource folder on res folder and open



106

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.050

up our menu folder there's a menu folder



107

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.160

there should be a mini folder but



108

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.750

depending on which template you used to



109

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.760

create the project you may or may not



110

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.560

have a folder so if you haven't got one



111

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.540

you want to actually create the new one



112

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.730

so in the case of this particular



113

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.920

project I use the empty activity



114

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.630

template when I created it and that



115

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.640

doesn't create a menu folder but it



116

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.050

isn't a problem as I mentioned we can



117

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.090

actually create one the templates just



118

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.770

created a few few of the files you need



119

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.090

and do you know really just



120

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.770

to get you started but you can do



121

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.060

everything afterwards if you've chosen



122

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.320

the template that doesn't include the



123

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.660

fitti you need so my case I'm going to



124

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.310

just click on the res folder right click



125

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.500

click on you and I'm going to choose



126

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.770

Android resource directory now the



127

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.560

resource type we will set that to menu



128

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.360

when we do that notice that the



129

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.100

directory name changed automatically to



130

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.110

menu as well everything else is fine



131

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.780

Isis so just click on OK we've got a



132

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.060

menu follower as you can see over here



133

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.710

and what we now need is a menu so let's



134

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.590

right click the menu directory itself



135

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.530

click on new we want to select new menu



136

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.220

resource file and for this one this is



137

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.660

going to be a list of the available feed



138

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.210

so I want to call it feeds and let's go



139

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.889

up menu click on ok and we're now in the



140

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.080

menu designer once that loads up now



141

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.539

once again don't be afraid to experiment



142

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.000

with the features of this design of once



143

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.500

we've created our menu I'm gonna be



144

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.789

showing you how to make it appear in an



145

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.919

app so you can have a play creating



146

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.210

menus and just get you know really a



147

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.000

feel for how the designer works now



148

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.350

there are a few things different in this



149

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.270

designer when you're using it for menus



150

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.240

rather than layouts know the obvious one



151

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.950

is it is a is there's a much smaller



152

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.539

choice of things to drag from the



153

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.270

palette just items menus groups and a



154

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.110

couple of other things



155

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.030

now another difference is that there's



156

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.669

no blueprint and no button to display it



157

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.039

the menus don't have constraints so all



158

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.870

the buttons to do with constraints are



159

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.419

also not present no another difference



160

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.310

that isn't immediately obvious is that



161

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.169

you can make more use of the component



162

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.460

tree when creating menus and you're



163

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.680

gonna be seeing that shortly to start



164

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.360

with firms gonna drag three of these



165

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.520

menu thingies these ones here the menu



166

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.650

item things I'm not sure what Google was



167

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.030

actually calling them and one reason I'm



168

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.039

encouraging you to experiment is that I



169

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.979

still can't find any documentation



170

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.240

Middies themselves are documented but



171

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.060

all the examples still air at the XML



172

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.050

been anyway let's just drag three of



173

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:30.439

these menu items



174

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.899

as you can see me do there I'll just



175

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:34.849

drop them one below the other you know



176

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.559

don't worry too much about trying to



177

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:38.689

place them anywhere in particular once



178

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.249

your mouse pointer is over the design



179

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.439

it'll change from in it no entry symbol



180

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:43.789

to the symbol with the plus which you



181

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.499

probably saw the green plus and you can



182

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:46.639

just let go at that point



183

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.129

and once you've got two items on the



184

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:50.869

design you can see a difference in



185

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.279

behaviors so it's possible to add the



186

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.139

third one either to the bottom of the



187

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.569

other to war in between and I'll just



188

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:57.619

show you again I'll just select another



189

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:59.689

one so you can select another one notice



190

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.699

it's appearing in orange there and I can



191

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.619

move something and go up and down you



192

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:05.389

can see the little blue line moving is



193

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:07.159

or the green line I should say as to



194

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.849

where it's going to go and I'll put that



195

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.069

back anyway for now basically always



196

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:14.449

harlot Hollings to give you the feedback



197

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.309

about what will happen but at this stage



198

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:17.539

it doesn't really matter whether you add



199

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:19.039

the third item to the end or in-between



200

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.919

the existing ones but obviously that



201

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.269

could matter if you're modifying an



202

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:25.399

existing menu but in my case you saw me



203

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.469

just add one after the other so what I'm



204

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:28.879

going to do first is from the top I'm



205

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.009

going to give them ID give them both or



206

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:32.559

all IDs so I'm gonna select the top one



207

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:35.719

and we'll call this one a menu deviation



208

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:39.769

for menus then we'll put free the next



209

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:45.740

one we'll call that one a menu paid and



210

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.969

for the third one will go with a menu



211

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:52.249

songs well as your publisher to change



212

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:53.659

the titles as well so let's go back and



213

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:56.089

do that as well so the title is going to



214

00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:00.979

be free apps for Emma you free for the



215

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:02.959

second one we're going to go with paid



216

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:06.829

apps and for the third one we're going



217

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:11.829

to go with unsurprisingly songs okay



218

00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:14.059

and we've got a warning here about too



219

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:15.499

hard coding strings but we'll ignore



220

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:17.419

that for now in the componentry and



221

00:08:17.419 --> 00:08:19.099

that's really all we need to do at this



222

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:21.229

stage we'll come back and look at some



223

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:22.399

of the other things we can do in here



224

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:24.349

but for now I just want to switch over



225

00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:27.469

to the XML XML version or view you



226

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:29.479

should say the text view and reformat



227

00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:34.669

the code if it's needed you can see



228

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.110

there's a slight change to reform when I



229

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.729

did that I'm going to switch back to



230

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:42.960

design and I'm going to close the file



231

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.550

it's not necessary to switch back to the



232

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.110

soil but Android studio will open the



233

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.060

father of the moji last left it in so in



234

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.320

my case I want to go back into design



235

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.150

made in the future all right so I'm



236

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.800

going to stop the video here in the next



237

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.360

one we're going to work on adding the



238

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.760

code to make these menus work so I will



239

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.660

see you in the next video
