00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.390

Alright, so it's time to start creating



2

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.860

an app that does a little bit more than



3

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.830

just displaying some text on the screen.



4

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.150

So in this section we're going to create



5

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.459

a button click app to show how to get a



6

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.920

button on the screen to perform some



7

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.590

operation when it's clicked. Now we're



8

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.000

going to use this relatively simple



9

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.460

example to have a look at quite a few



10

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.950

important concepts and we're actually



11

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.200

going to cover firstly the constraint



12

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.270

layout and this was introduced in



13

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.750

Android studio 2.2 and it's much more



14

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.359

efficient than the previous approach of



15

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.550

having to nest layouts to create your



16

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.739

apps screens. Now although it was



17

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.329

introduced when Nougat was released



18

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.120

Android N, Google have made sure that



19

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.999

it's compatible with all API levels way



20

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.359

back to Gingerbread and that's API 9,



21

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.159

secondly we're going to look at views



22

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.379

now every widget you place on the screen



23

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.319

is actually a view in Android and a



24

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.389

widget by the way are the various



25

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.999

components that make up a useful Android



26

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.760

screen things like buttons text boxes



27

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.430

sliders they're all views. Now it's



28

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.680

possibly a strange use of the word view



29

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.160

but that's what Android calls them, third



30

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.840

we're going to look at Android events.



31

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.000

Now when we want a button to do



32

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.130

something we have to write code that



33

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.010

responds to an event now in this case



34

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.020

the event is the user tapping the button,



35

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.970

so we'll see how that's done



36

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.010

we're also going to look at writing code



37

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.590

in Android studio now we can't do much



38

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.020

at all without creating some code so



39

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.310

this section will introduce writing



40

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.370

Kotlin code in Android studio, we're also



41

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.020

going to look at activities as well as



42

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.720

the activity lifecycle now activities



43

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.540

are an important concept in Android so



44

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.920

I'm going to be explaining what they are



45

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.440

and discussing their lifecycle when an



46

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.480

app is running, you'll also see that



47

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.550

Android destroys your screens when you



48

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.080

do something like rotating the phone



49

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.900

from portrait into landscape it stops



50

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.550

your code and completely removes the



51

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.920

entire activity from memory, now that



52

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.570

sounds a bit drastic but we'll be



53

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.610

looking at how Android allows us to cope



54

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.340

with that situation and it happens when



55

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.080

you use most apps and it is something



56

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.630

that users are generally aware of.



57

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.830

Alright we're going to start by showing



58

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.430

now how to use the designer in Android studio



59

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.859

to create two screens for our app and we'll



60

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.420

have a play with it to get used to how



61

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.159

it works and what we can do with it.



62

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.409

So let's get started on that in the next video.
