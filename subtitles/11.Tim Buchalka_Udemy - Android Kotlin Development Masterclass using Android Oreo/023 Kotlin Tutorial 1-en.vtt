00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.379

Alright so we're all set up now so



2

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.170

it's time to start learning Kotlin,



3

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.180

so start Android studio and then open the



4

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.969

Kotlin tutorial project so I'm gonna



5

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.470

open up this by clicking on Kotlin



6

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.320

tutorial and just a reminder to ignore



7

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.140

the outdated Kotlin runtime or messages



8

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.460

of that nature for this particular



9

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.009

project because we've had to hack things



10

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.050

together to get it to work, so if you



11

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.219

do that you'll find that things won't



12

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:32.790

work properly. Alright now open up the



13

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.770

main dot kt file by double clicking it



14

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.000

if it's not already showing on the



15

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.100

right-hand side of the screen, in my case



16

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.260

it was already open and by the way if



17

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.790

you want to close it at any time you can



18

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.870

come over here and click on the X to



19

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.880

close it and then we'll click it to open



20

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.950

it again so that's what you do when you



21

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.060

want to work with different files you



22

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.380

can just choose which ones to appear in



23

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.060

the tab list above the editor window



24

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.980

here and you can have multiple ones on



25

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.079

that list and click on to select the



26

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.350

different ones now unlike Java you don't



27

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.600

need to create a class to hold your



28

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.149

Kotlin code and if I keep referring to



29

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.670

Java in this tutorial things are going



30

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.320

to get very confusing for students who



31

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.759

don't understand Java.



32

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.859

Now there's one example I've just talked



33

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.149

about classes and we haven't even



34

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.639

discussed what they are yet so for most



35

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:17.340

of this tutorial section I'm not going



36

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.590

to keep comparing things to Java I won't



37

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.270

promise not to mention Java now and then



38

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.759

but I won't do it very often we will



39

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.499

start by looking at that simple function



40

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.689

on-screen here that just prints out



41

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.249

hello world that you saw running in the



42

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.499

previous video. Now that looks a bit



43

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.359

horrible but this particular function



44

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.270

has to follow that format now the reason



45

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.399

is that the computer needs to know which



46

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.439

function it should start with when you



47

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.959

run your program so you have to start



48

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.270

with a function called main that has a



49

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.369

declaration exactly like we've got here



50

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.709

on line one now things are a bit



51

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.509

different when creating an Android app



52

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.240

rather than a Kotlin program but at the



53

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.520

moment we're learning Kotlin so we have



54

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.889

to use a main function in this form now



55

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.099

the keyword fund defines a function and



56

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.099

our functions called main you everything



57

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.599

between the opening and closing braces



58

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.380

as these here at the end of line 1 and



59

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.900

the style of line 3 that's part of this



60

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.420

function now inside the function is the



61

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.540

code that's executed when our program runs



62

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.250

make sure you put your coat in between



63

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.080

these two curly braces so you can see



64

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.180

here on line one on line three when you



65

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.980

want it to be executed as part of this



66

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.290

function so this function prints out the



67

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.390

message helloworld which is what this



68

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.519

print line statement here on line two



69

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.700

actually does. Now Kotlin programs are



70

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.409

normally a lot more complex than this



71

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.870

they contain a lot more classes and



72

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.329

functions and can also repeat bits of



73

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.459

code and so forth but this is a very



74

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.400

basic Kotlin program so what our



75

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.810

function is doing is calling another



76

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.359

function called print 'ln and that's



77

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.129

short for print and start a new line and



78

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.859

the functions part of the Kotlin library



79

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.109

so that just means it comes with Collin



80

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.720

to give us a way to print things so we



81

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.700

tell it what to print by putting what's



82

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.650

called an argument inside these



83

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.629

parentheses as you can see here on line



84

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.989

two so that's the argument that's in



85

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.849

between those two in between the



86

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.620

parentheses or inside the parentheses



87

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.959

and here the argument is the text hello



88

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.389

world in double quotes and by the way



89

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.579

because we're dealing with text rather



90

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.220

than numbers we enclose hello world in



91

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.959

speech marks all these double quotes as



92

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.120

we call them in Australia so our main



93

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.370

function uses another function called



94

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.980

print 'ln to print the text that we've



95

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.340

given it. Now arguments are values that



96

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.709

you provide to functions to give them



97

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.209

the information that you want them to



98

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.819

work with so the print line function



99

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.459

needs to know what to print and we tell



100

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.769

it by giving it a string of characters



101

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.180

enclosed in these speech marks or double



102

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.459

quotes so let's just run the program



103

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.139

again to see if it's doing what we



104

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.629

expect so what we can do we can also



105

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.900

right-click in here within the editor



106

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.419

window to get the context menu right



107

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.069

click it and I'm going to select main



108

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.150

Katie if I select that you can see down



109

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.620

the bottom bottom left-hand corner we've



110

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.560

got holo world showing on the screen now



111

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.000

the console should have opened up



112

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.400

automatically but if it doesn't you may



113

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.409

need to click on this run tab at the



114

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.239

bottom of the screen over here and say



115

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.630

you've got to turn it off and turn it on again



116

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.159

so if it's open it's it'll close when I



117

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.300

click it if it's closed



118

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.530

I'll open it'll open when I actually



119

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.419

click it again alright so there's our



120

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.240

holo world text printed out now when a



121

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.400

program runs without any errors



122

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.720

we'll see that the message at the end



123

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.020

says price has finished with exit code



124

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.600

zero. Now normally an extra code other



125

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.669

than zero means that something's gone



126

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.650

wrong but you'll normally get an error



127

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.389

message as well so you'll know if that



128

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:45.990

hasn't worked.



129

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.240

So let's actually print something else



130

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.199

out so they'll come down here and type



131

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.260

in print 'ln they're going to type my



132

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:06.090

first Kotlin program and we've got this



133

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.919

red squiggle at the end of the line as



134

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.320

you can see over here and over to the



135

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.539

right-hand margin is a red dash over



136

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.030

here. Now Edward studio does that to



137

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.789

indicate errors and warnings we'll be



138

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.229

seeing some warnings later they'll



139

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.430

appear in a different color



140

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.740

normally orange or amber and you can



141

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.020

choose to ignore those it's a good idea



142

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.760

that one to at least read them though



143

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.680

because they'll often highlight problems



144

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.139

with your code the warnings won't stop



145

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.180

the code from running but they could



146

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.650

mean that it won't do quite what you



147

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.590

expected but these red arrows Oh can't



148

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.900

be ignored the code just won't run when



149

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.150

you've got errors like this so to see



150

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.490

what the actual error is you can hover



151

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.289

the mouse either over the school over



152

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.820

here or over here in the right margin



153

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.130

the arrow is just saying expecting and



154

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.770

then in single quotes our right



155

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.780

parenthesis so it's just telling us that



156

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.580

the line must end with the closing



157

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.370

parenthesis now computers are very picky



158

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.560

and it's important that your code



159

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.900

follows the syntax of the programming



160

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.419

language exactly you'll pick up the



161

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.190

rules by reading and writing code so



162

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.840

don't think that you have to remember a



163

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.820

whole lot of complicated grammar before



164

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.919

you can program if you do make mistakes



165

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.570

which you will because it's a natural



166

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.940

part of learning to program then Android



167

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.099

studio or the Kotlin compiler will give



168

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.130

you errors to indicate what's wrong now



169

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.180

there's nothing actually wrong with



170

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.889

getting errors it's a natural part of



171

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.479

learning how to program you know I wish



172

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.979

I could claim that I never get errors in



173

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.440

my code but even after over thirty years



174

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.900

of programming I still make mistakes so



175

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.340

don't worry the more mistakes you make



176

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.050

though that probably means you're



177

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.510

learning faster so unlike human



178

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.870

languages computer languages are very precise



179

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.670

you have to stick to the syntax of the



180

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.770

language and if you think about it even



181

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.750

human languages need correct punctuation



182

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.240

though being intelligent we can often



183

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.100

work out what so really meant if the



184

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.830

punctuation isn't quite right but



185

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.780

punctuation is still important have a



186

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.840

look at this slide now here's exactly



187

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.750

the same text but punctuated in two



188

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.970

different ways and if you haven't read



189

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.460

of both of those you'll see that there's



190

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.740

a big difference just by adding



191

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.980

punctuation in appropriate places so if



192

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.630

you do find yourself getting frustrated



193

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.760

remember that that it's only a computer



194

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.980

he can't think for itself and you have



195

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.440

to compensate for that by being very



196

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.440

precise in how you write your code so



197

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.970

that the poor computer can understand



198

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.790

you. Alright so back to Android studio



199

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.470

so it's telling us there's something



200

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.280

wrong here,



201

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.810

so I'm going to add the closing



202

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.440

parenthesis to the end like so and



203

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.480

notice that the red - the has



204

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.970

disappeared as well as the red lines in



205

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.040

the right side of the screen the right



206

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.230

margin, so now that we haven't got any



207

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.030

errors we can run this again and now



208

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.680

that I've already run the program for



209

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.720

the first time by right clicking I can



210

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.070

just actually come up here to the green



211

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.260

triangle up in the toolbar I can click



212

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.270

on that now that doesn't always work



213

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.250

until you be the right clicked and



214

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.350

chosen the function you want to run or



215

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.900

use the run menu now you can see on



216

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.220

there there's already been different



217

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.540

options for running so I'm click on that



218

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.910

you've got different options there but



219

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.860

we've only got the one file here they've



220

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.500

only got may end up Katie so if you end



221

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.120

up running the wrong program later in



222

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.250

the course either right-click on the



223

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.710

code well it's in the editor that you



224

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.900

want to run or use the menus to come up



225

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.400

here and then choose the actual menu but



226

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.680

in our case we've just got the one menu



227

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.690

of the one file because that's all we've



228

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.220

worked on up until this point in the



229

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.530

course so after that the green button



230

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.090

should work for whatever map function



231

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.220

you're trying to run but you will have



232

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.080

to tell it to run it the first time,



233

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.640

so if I just click on that now you can see



234

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.990

we've got hello world there my first



235

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.120

Kotlin program. So then you've got a



236

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.010

function containing two lines to execute



237

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.080

and unless we do something to tell it



238

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.030

otherwise, Kotlin will just start at the



239

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.620

top and obey the instructions on each



240

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.360

line until it gets to the end,



241

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.340

we can't have a look at what we can do



242

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.620

to make it behave differently shortly



243

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.300

but before that we need to have a look



244

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.730

at variables or properties we'll do that



245

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.450

in the next video.
