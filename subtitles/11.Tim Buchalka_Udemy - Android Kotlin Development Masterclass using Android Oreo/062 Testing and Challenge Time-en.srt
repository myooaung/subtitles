1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,780
so and at the last video by asking the

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,039
question does it work

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,330
so let's actually try running this

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,400
program to make sure that it does work

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,099
so we're going to run it on the emulator

6
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,180
now I'm going to go over here and click

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,550
on this little green arrow on the

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,710
toolbar to run the app then I'm going to

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,630
choose the emulator now I've probably

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,309
got a lot more emulators than you've

11
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,079
actually got in your system and you can

12
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,009
actually see that some of these are

13
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:29,899
missing a system image the one that I've

14
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,180
got connected and currently using is

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,420
this nexus 4 api 26 which of course is

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,760
android 8 so you want to select your

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,540
android 8 device your emulator and I'm

18
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,590
doing that now we're going to click on

19
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,390
OK

20
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,410
and I've already got it started so I'm

21
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,420
going to come over here and we'll have a

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,400
look at what the app looks like on that

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,560
device you can see down the bottom of

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,180
the screen there that Gradle build is

25
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,520
running and we've got a progress bar

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
that hasn't updated but it is actually

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,239
processing away for the first time and

28
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,310
generating the build the Android

29
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,899
application and then sending it to the

30
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,699
emulator so that we can actually see

31
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,590
what it looks like and keep in mind that

32
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,360
if you've got a slower computer and he's

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,429
short of memory it's definitely worth

34
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:12,170
starting the emulator before you start

35
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,880
coding so it's up on running and ready

36
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,469
for when you want to test your app and

37
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:17,179
you can see that in my case I had the

38
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:21,560
emulator already running

39
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,360
okay so you can see the app is now are

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,369
on screen and there's a couple of things

41
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,960
I should explain about it in case you

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,939
think that you messed up creating the

43
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,220
layout in the challenge firstly there

44
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,080
let's test it and when I click the

45
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,580
button the message is added or should be

46
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,070
added to the textview down here so I got

47
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,930
the in name there if I just put in my

48
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,080
name

49
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,539
and click on button you can see the

50
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,180
button got tapped one time and if we

51
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,119
kick it again the button got tapped to

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,789
time and then one more time you can see

53
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,140
that the text this time is the button

54
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,590
got tapped three time so the actual

55
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,299
concept is working well the text is

56
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,250
being added to the textview successfully

57
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,619
what we should have done is cleared the

58
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,750
original text first so we're going to do

59
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,819
that when we go back to the code I'm

60
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,069
going to click just a few more times to

61
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,750
see what happens once we get to the

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,660
stage of filling things up and I'm

63
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,110
tapping and you can see now rather you

64
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,190
can't see what's happening and that's

65
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,330
because the text is now over

66
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,580
disappearing behind the on-screen

67
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,010
keyboard now that's the first thing you

68
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,140
might think you've got wrong but it's

69
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,269
okay and that's actually normal behavior

70
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,910
on Android now the plain text widget

71
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,739
that we used when working in the

72
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,590
designer is an edit text and what an

73
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,810
inner text is is basically a textview

74
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,940
that's been extended to allow editing

75
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,489
now obviously on an Android device you'd

76
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,769
normally need the keyboard when typing

77
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,720
so the edit text widget has been

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,820
designed to cope when the keyboards on

79
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,220
the screen now because you can't type

80
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,290
into a text view it doesn't help that

81
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,209
behavior so there's nothing wrong with

82
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,250
the layout as such it's working as it

83
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,560
should now if you did want to text you

84
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,510
to shrink to accommodate the keyboard

85
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,880
you could do that in your code although

86
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,560
it may well be easier to use and enter

87
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,109
text then disable it so that text Kirby

88
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:12,060
typed that way you get the benefit of

89
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,620
the added functionality and edit text

90
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,019
has the dealing with the keyboard while

91
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,609
still having something behaved that

92
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:21,060
behaves more like a text view now we'll

93
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,739
be doing that in a later section just so

94
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,260
you can see how it's done but the second

95
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,480
thing I want to show you is if I now

96
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,280
dismiss the keyboard by clicking on this

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,709
down arrow and I'll tap a few more times

98
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,450
or rather because I'm you're running an

99
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,050
emulator I'm beating my mouse

100
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,010
what till we get to the bottom of the

101
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,599
screen and my emulator and I'm still top

102
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,130
still tapping now but you notice that

103
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,040
the text view doesn't scroll so once

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,420
again you haven't done anything wrong in

105
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,700
your layout the multi-line edit text

106
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,200
widget Scrolls when you set the

107
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,510
scrollbar but to make a text view scroll

108
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,370
there's an extra step we need to do in

109
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,040
the code now the final thing that needs

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,750
to be fixed is that the message itself

111
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,269
isn't very good the button got tapped to

112
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,150
time got tapped to three time etc well

113
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,580
that isn't very good English so overall

114
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,780
though the program seems to be working

115
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,239
fine so far and we've successfully

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,610
linked code to a button so that it

117
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,560
responds to clicks and that it actually

118
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,250
does something

119
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,260
but let's fix those three issues though

120
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,030
that we've talked about and we'll do

121
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,460
that by going back to the code now

122
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,470
firstly clearing the existing text from

123
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,210
the textview when the program starts is

124
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,790
really easy but before you switch to the

125
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,889
layout to delete the text property I'm

126
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:33,290
going to show you another way so

127
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,790
clearing it in the layout is a perfectly

128
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,440
good way to do it by the way but

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,419
essentially when you're starting out it

130
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,130
can be very useful to leave text in the

131
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,320
text few widgets as otherwise it can be

132
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,120
really hard to tell that they're there

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,130
without looking at the blueprint or

134
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,020
selecting them I'm going to show you a

135
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,240
way around that later but another way to

136
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,190
clear it is to set its text property in

137
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,919
code and provide an empty string so what

138
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,570
I'm going to do is add a few lines of

139
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,940
code now we're going to just scroll up

140
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,270
here to the original definitions of the

141
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,350
well actually we've got the original

142
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,600
declarations up here but then when we've

143
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,150
added our find view by ID calls for each

144
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,850
below that textview we were going to

145
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,169
initialize it so we're going to put text

146
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:18,479
view question mark dot text is equal to

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,289
+ two double quotes now unlike append

148
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,330
which adds text so to any already

149
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,370
they're setting the text property

150
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,200
replaces all the texts in the textview

151
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,260
with the new text by providing a blank

152
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,120
string which we've done here on line 23

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,460
that's three sets of speech marks with

154
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,020
nothing between them two double quotes

155
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,330
in other words we replace any existing

156
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,160
text with nothing and that effectively

157
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,780
clears what's already there on screen

158
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,419
all right the next thing to do is to add

159
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,390
an S after the word time if the buttons

160
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,940
been clicked

161
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,440
more than once so that the English is

162
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,080
correct and what we can do is add the

163
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,460
code for that I'm going to start by

164
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,100
adding some code to line 29 so what I'm

165
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,810
going to do is put an if clause in there

166
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,780
is I can if parentheses numtimesclicked

167
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,970
if that is not equal to the exclamation

168
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,130
mark equal one and curly braces then

169
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,280
we're going to put textview question

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,000
mark dot append parentheses in double

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,970
quotes yes

172
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,470
so rather than checking for a number of

173
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,360
clicks being greater than one I've

174
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,910
checked it for not equal to one that way

175
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,680
if we ever change it to record to zero

176
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,390
before the button is clicked it would

177
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,040
still read correctly that's because in

178
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,320
English you'd say zero times and not

179
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,720
zero time now that's not true in all

180
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,970
languages though in fact Android has

181
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,260
full support for dealing with

182
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,120
translations into other languages

183
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,190
including the different way of phrasing

184
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,230
things when there are zero one or more

185
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,060
than one of them so it's a good idea to

186
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,040
design programs with international users

187
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,990
in mind now I'm not going to do that

188
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,820
right there though because we've already

189
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,169
got enough to think about at the moment

190
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,120
but we will be coming back to this

191
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,919
because it's one of the reasons for some

192
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
of the warnings we didn't resolve in the

193
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,610
layout designer all right so at this

194
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,290
point that's two of our problems sorted

195
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,360
there's just a scrolling to handle now

196
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,430
now I mentioned that the textview

197
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,530
doesn't automatically enable scrolling

198
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,630
just because we turned on the scroll bar

199
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,110
but the inner text widget does in fact

200
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,730
the inner text just does what we're

201
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,860
about to do automatically when scroll

202
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,480
bars are enabled and that's one of the

203
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,490
ways that it extends the textview so

204
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,419
what we're going to do though is we're

205
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,280
going to add some code back up here onto

206
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,240
line that 24 and this is just going to

207
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,160
make the textview scroll so we're going

208
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,410
to type textview Westermarck dot and

209
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,240
select movement there finis you can see

210
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,970
they're equals and then we're going to

211
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,150
top scroll or scroll English the same

212
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,690
movement method and parentheses on the

213
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,120
end and they were starting a new

214
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,919
scrolling movement method to the text

215
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,930
views movement method property is all

216
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,760
that's needed to make the textview

217
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,160
scroll now this only works because we

218
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,200
added a vertical scrollbar in the layer

219
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,080
out so that step was still needed all

220
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,850
rights at this point now it's time to

221
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,980
test the program again just to make sure

222
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,390
that we've hopefully I'd out all these

223
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,240
problems now the emulator was running

224
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,130
before but this time now that we've got

225
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,500
a deployed version of the program the

226
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,120
instant run should automatically update

227
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,740
the app for us on the virtual device and

228
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,110
restart the app for us fairly quickly so

229
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,060
I'm going to run that and then tab over

230
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,260
to our web you later

231
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,090
we should find it's a lot faster to

232
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,560
start this time all right so there's our

233
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,080
app again now firstly notice that we're

234
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,210
starting with a clear area now so

235
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,180
clearly the the dot text setting that to

236
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,030
an empty string worked and we click the

237
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,190
button a few times the button got tapped

238
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,620
one time and we don't notice we've now

239
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,900
got the correct s being added on the end

240
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,420
two times and tapped a few more times

241
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,380
and fr you dismiss the keyboard and

242
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,120
let's see what happens if we get down to

243
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,410
the bottom will that actually scroll for

244
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,820
us and you can see that still not

245
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,970
scrolling at this point for us however

246
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,480
we can scroll it as you can see here and

247
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,010
see the rest of the text by scrolling it

248
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,980
up and down disappears if we haven't

249
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,480
selected it in other words if you didn't

250
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,030
have a finger and moving it up and down

251
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,950
if you're using a real device on my case

252
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,750
I'm using the mouse we can see that it

253
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,510
does now scroll for us keep in mind

254
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,830
though that emulators are just that

255
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,930
emulators they're not real devices and

256
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,970
it's rare to control a really Android

257
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,740
device with a mouse it is possible that

258
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,810
of course most people won't do that

259
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,760
so the mouse here is behaving like a

260
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,240
finger on the phone's screen and again

261
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,650
I'm mentioning that because the scroll

262
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,480
indicators you can see clearly doesn't

263
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,460
appear until I click and hold down the

264
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,290
mouse button on the text you when I did

265
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,330
that we were able to then scroll up or

266
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,370
down depending on where we are on the

267
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,920
screen and the other thing on a point

268
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,990
out here is that what we can see on the

269
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,040
right hand side that's a scroll

270
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,950
indicator not a scroll bar on your

271
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,110
operating system Windows Mac or Linux he

272
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,360
scrolled by dragging the scroll bars but

273
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,190
on Android you scroll by dragging the

274
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,200
screen so keeping the mouse button down

275
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,790
and moving up and down as I'm doing now

276
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,070
the contents of the text view are

277
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,530
scrolling so that's how you'll do it all

278
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,820
right so I think overall that's looking

279
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:15,970
at

280
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,889
better there's still a slight problem

281
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,750
though and if we go back up to the top

282
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,310
you may have noticed it we still have

283
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,500
this blank line up here I was putting a

284
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,899
blank line before the first message and

285
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,490
actually think that would make for a

286
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,790
good challenge alright so the challenge

287
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,160
is to change the code so that a blank

288
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,589
line isn't printed before the messages

289
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:39,129
but is printed after them so that's your

290
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:40,509
our challenge I'm going to pause the

291
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,279
video now see how you go about making

292
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,050
that change and come back and you can

293
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,300
actually see our solution see you when

294
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,259
you get back alright so there's always

295
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,389
more than one way to code things even a

296
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,639
simple change like this one so the real

297
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,110
test with all the challenges in the

298
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,199
course is does it work so if your

299
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,939
messages print out fine with each one on

300
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:02,680
a new line and no blank line at the

301
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,300
start then you've completed the

302
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,699
challenge so my solution want to have a

303
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,709
look at that what I'm going to do is

304
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,860
actually change the output I'm going to

305
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,949
get rid of the /n at the start of the

306
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:17,800
string what I'm going to do is make a

307
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,170
change to add it at the end I'm going to

308
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,259
come down here to our give test we're

309
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:25,899
going to add a backslash in there then

310
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,100
what I'm going to do is change the code

311
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,959
for an else else textview question mark

312
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,529
dot append double quotes and in

313
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,410
parentheses backslash N and obviously I

314
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,449
remove the backslash n at the start as

315
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,639
well so we're consequently making sure

316
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,610
there's the backslash n will appear on

317
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,709
any text that at the end of the line of

318
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,829
any text that is showing or as being

319
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:53,800
output it onto the screen all right so

320
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,829
let's go ahead and run the program now

321
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:58,420
it's and check that till the challenge

322
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,399
does actually work all right so we're

323
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,160
going to just press the button

324
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,379
it's a button a few more times you can

325
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,610
see it seems to be working a lot better

326
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,189
now we still got a bit of a gap there

327
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,290
but that's just a normal gap spacing now

328
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,350
between controls as opposed to the

329
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,879
problem before we had a much larger gap

330
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,850
and that was caused by the initial

331
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,990
backslash n that was at the start of the

332
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,980
line before we actually started

333
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,500
outputting

334
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,110
so that's the challenge sorted out there

335
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,550
is still a problem though and I'm going

336
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,020
to show you how to fix that in a later

337
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,510
video so what I'll do first is just make

338
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,580
sure that we can still scroll these

339
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,570
you're still scroll out so that's still

340
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,300
working as well all right but again I

341
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,290
mentioned that there's still a problem

342
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,000
though and I'm this problem about to

343
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,410
show you I'm going to show how to fix in

344
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,960
a later video now remember that I said

345
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,730
you should always test your code in both

346
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,610
portrait and landscape now when I go

347
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,670
ahead and rotate this so I'll rotate the

348
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,260
emulator until landscape you can see

349
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,710
over here I'm going to do that you'll

350
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,240
see soon as I did that all the messages

351
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,940
disappeared and just to confirm that if

352
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,680
I had a few more now in the landscape

353
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,070
mode and I can still scroll as you can

354
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,930
see there before then just move this

355
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,190
over so we can see it a bit better and

356
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,240
if I rotate back to portrait see we've

357
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,620
got the same problem the messages are

358
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,110
disappearing again I'm going to show you

359
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,850
how to deal with that in the next video

360
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,130
for now though I'm going to tell you

361
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,540
that the reason it happens is that

362
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,030
Android destroys your activity when the

363
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,880
device orientation changes then creates

364
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,760
it again in the new orientation now that

365
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,320
might take a moment to sink in because

366
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,150
it sounds like a very strange way to do

367
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,480
things

368
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,430
destroying the activity just because the

369
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,790
user rotates a phone seems a bit drastic

370
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,350
but in fact it's a very elegant solution

371
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,930
to a problem that's more complex than it

372
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,760
may appear to be now it's true that

373
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,820
that's that is what Android does and you

374
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,230
know it works because you've rotated

375
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,820
your phone loads of times and your apps

376
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,290
have carried on with the new screen size

377
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,750
with no problems now in the next video

378
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,430
we're going to start extending the app

379
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,990
so it does something a bit more useful

380
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,670
and then we have a look at how to cope

381
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,830
with changes as an orientation when your

382
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,810
app is running so I'll see you in the

383
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,200
next video
