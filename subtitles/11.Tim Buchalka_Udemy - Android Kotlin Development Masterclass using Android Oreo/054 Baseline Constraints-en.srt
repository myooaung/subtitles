1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,800
Alright so let's go ahead now and add

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,900
these two buttons to the bottom right of

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,750
the layout. Now the buttons will appear

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,299
under the widgets category click on

5
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,900
widgets now I'm going to select button

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,610
I'm going to drag it right down to the

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,550
bottom right hand corner now notice that

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,289
when I do that and the guidelines appear

9
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,570
both horizontally and vertically when I

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,699
release my button the mouse button

11
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,970
we've surprisingly got constraints on

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,470
the right hand side and on the bottom

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,210
side so it's no constraint to the bottom

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,190
right of the layout and in this case

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,770
it's exactly what I wanted to happen now

16
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,210
it's pretty cool but only works if you

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,039
get those guidelines before dropping the

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,199
widget so let's see if it works out what

19
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:47,570
to do though with the second button now

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,949
this second button is going to be the

21
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,350
okay button and we'll go to the left of

22
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,510
the first one so the only aim here is to

23
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,789
drop it about 16 DP to the left of the

24
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,629
first button I'm gonna select that drag

25
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:04,460
it over around about 16 DP to the left

26
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,850
of the first button and release now in

27
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,590
this case we've only got one constraint

28
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,420
and that's what I'll do is I'll delete

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,710
that again as I try and move it so it's

30
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,100
around about in that area release it you

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,450
can see it hasn't quite got it right

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,130
here we've got a constraint just at the

33
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,980
bottom at the moment and if you don't

34
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,540
get the left-hand button constrain to

35
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,610
the right one you can just create the

36
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,930
constraint manually and I'm going to go

37
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,460
ahead and do that it's gonna see at the

38
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,470
moment we've only got a constraint from

39
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,570
the button to the bottom of the layout

40
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,890
so we're going to constrain it to the

41
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,470
left constrain the right of the second

42
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,290
button to the left of the first one and

43
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,460
you can see we've now got two

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,800
constraints now even though that's

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,330
happened that's not quite what we want

46
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,580
the two buttons should be aligned to

47
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,710
each other vertically and a lot of this

48
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,480
sort of does that they asked sealed

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,970
independent now let's put some text in

50
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,860
the buttons so that we can refer to them

51
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,080
as okay and cancel and that'll make it a

52
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,670
little bit clearer on what I'm talking

53
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,650
about I'm going to make sure that the

54
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,560
left button is clicked which it is and I

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,530
come up over here into text they're

56
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,280
going to type in okay I just press ENTER

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,319
and you can see that the text has updated

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,840
that button. Now be careful when doing

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,450
that and use the text attribute and not

60
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,249
the one below that with the wrench or

61
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:28,099
spanner before it now any attribute you

62
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,989
see an inspector marked with the wrench

63
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,689
is a tool attribute and that means that

64
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,489
it only affects the display in the

65
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,950
layout designer tool attributes are

66
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,489
ignored when the app runs on a device

67
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,170
all right so now if I drag the okay

68
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,010
button up the screen you can see that

69
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,560
it's no longer aligned with the cancel

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,959
button now there's a number of ways that

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,359
we can get the effect we want I could

72
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,189
constrain the bottom of the okay button

73
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:57,590
to the bottom of the cancel button or

74
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,109
perhaps constrain its top to the top of

75
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:02,299
the cancel button now either of those

76
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,549
would work fine but when you're dealing

77
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,040
with widgets containing text it's also

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,079
useful to be able to line up the

79
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:11,359
baseline of the text rather than the

80
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,209
edges of the widget now both our buttons

81
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,400
rather are the same size and only

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,430
contain a single line of text so

83
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,750
constraining the tops or bottoms would

84
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,340
work but I want to show you how to

85
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,799
create a baseline constraint especially

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,560
because it can be a little bit fiddly

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,879
what I'll do first so as I just changed

88
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,840
the text on the other button to cancel

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,180
making sure that I'm not using the

90
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,220
attribute with the wrench cancel press

91
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,299
ENTER there to update it

92
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,099
and go back to the okay button by

93
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,409
selecting it again all right so Beth

94
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,569
both our buttons are the same size and

95
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,519
only contain a single line of text as I

96
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,889
said so we could constrain the tops or

97
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:50,959
bottoms and that would work but what I

98
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,159
really want to do is show you how to

99
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,470
create a baseline constraint again

100
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,319
because it can be quite fiddly now I

101
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,060
said previously that there were four

102
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,370
constraint handles one on each edge of

103
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,169
the widget but there's actually a fifth

104
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:06,109
on widgets that contain text and it's an

105
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,849
oval right in the middle of the button

106
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,729
but it doesn't actually appear until you

107
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:13,280
ask for it so making sure that you've

108
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,169
selected the okay button which I've done

109
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,909
and it's got this other little button

110
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:19,400
down here now called a B and I'll just

111
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,169
move the cursor away there briefly so

112
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,449
that disappears and if you come over

113
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:26,000
here you see the a B an init baseline

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,099
and I click on that that because that

115
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:30,169
causes the baseline constraint handle to

116
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,460
become available

117
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,319
and you can see that's no appeared in

118
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,020
the middle of the okay button now when I

119
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,389
click that and start to drag every

120
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,250
widget that supports baseline

121
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,500
constraints gets an oval head or in the

122
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,690
middle and I'm just going to start that

123
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,750
by just selecting it and notice now that

124
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,780
in the cancel button we've also got that

125
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,509
baseline and also in the text view at

126
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:55,699
the top left hand corner you can see one

127
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:56,660
there as well so I'm just going to

128
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,729
release the mouse button and you can see

129
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,289
that they disappear again I've got a

130
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,479
whole were at the end now and also the

131
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,220
text edit as well has also got that

132
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,220
baseline the oval so what we want to do

133
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,740
is hover over the eye of the oval until

134
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,229
the handle flashes I'll just do that

135
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,940
again just to make it clear so hover

136
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,830
over it until it flashes then you can

137
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,150
hold down or click your left mouse

138
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,340
button that then enables that for

139
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,229
dragging and what we want to do at this

140
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,630
point now is to drag the oval into the

141
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,880
cancel button and just before I do that

142
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,919
though it is important to wait for that

143
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,949
that flash before you create a baseline

144
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:33,229
constraint more so than with the other

145
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,419
four constraints and you'll discover the

146
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,669
problem for yourself when you start

147
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,960
inadvertently dragging widgets around

148
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,090
the screen so now you know the solution

149
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,210
alright so I'm still will still have the

150
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,270
button selected and I'm gonna drag the

151
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,580
oval from the okay button into the

152
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,590
cancel button and then release the mouse

153
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,810
button to create the constraint so ever

154
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,960
do that release it and you can see we've

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,060
now got a constraint from the okay

156
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,120
button to the cancel button now by the

157
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,680
way if there was a constraint from the

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,139
top or bottom of the okay button that

159
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,000
will have been deleted and that's

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,770
because you can't have top and bottom

161
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,990
constraints as well as a baseline

162
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,150
constraint so in other words you can

163
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,800
constrain the top and bottom of the

164
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,740
button or you can constrain its baseline

165
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,710
you can't do both so notice if the top

166
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,110
and bottom constraint handles have now

167
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,539
disappeared from the okay button so the

168
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:27,979
okay button is now constrained

169
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,500
vertically to remain lined up with the

170
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,830
baseline of the cancel button now a

171
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,389
baseline constraint like this is

172
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,460
different to constraining the top or

173
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,949
bottom of the button in this case it's

174
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,440
the actual text that lines up so if the

175
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,180
buttons are different heights the layout

176
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,900
looks better

177
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,820
and that's because the text itself is

178
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,520
aligned now when it was constrained to

179
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,410
the bottom edge of the layout that

180
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,759
allowed me to drag it up and down the

181
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,160
screen the only thing that changed was

182
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,660
the distance from the bottom of the

183
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,570
layout so now though it's constrained to

184
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,850
the center button so if I try to drag

185
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,389
the okay button up and down you'll find

186
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,190
that nothing happens I can drag it left

187
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,590
or right but I physically can't now drag

188
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,199
it up to any higher than the cancel

189
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,840
button but even cooler though watch what

190
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,610
happens when I drag the cancel button up

191
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,720
or down when the cancel button moves up

192
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
and down the OK button

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,900
follows it and that's because of the

194
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,580
vertical constraint I can put that back

195
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,949
to where it was now I might just tidy

196
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,180
this up a little bit by changing the

197
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,810
margins to 16 for both

198
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,880
now whether i'd constrain the top bottom

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,070
or baseline that would still be the case

200
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,130
the ok button can't be moved vertically

201
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,199
and that's because it's constrained to

202
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,180
the cancel button and when the kids our

203
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,310
button moves vertically the ok button

204
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,490
follows no notice also that when the ok

205
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,340
button selected up in the inspector

206
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,479
it shows the death sort of like a

207
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,430
downwards arrow to indicate that there

208
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,039
is a constraint but we can't change the

209
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,199
margin value like you can with the

210
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,460
constraint to the right so you can see

211
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,900
that there's no facility for me to

212
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,150
change that margin and that's because

213
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,039
baseline constraints in fact don't have

214
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,280
margins all right so let's select the

215
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,340
edit text widget again you can see at

216
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,620
the moment that it's constrained to the

217
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,919
right-hand edge of the screen so what

218
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,260
this constraint to the right-hand side

219
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,960
now ideally it should grow as text is

220
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,270
entered and if you remember from earlier

221
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,950
that means that we should set the height

222
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,289
to wrap content by clicking the inner

223
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,169
lines in the inspector I'm going to do

224
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,940
that in a minute but first what I'm

225
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,890
going to do is put some text into it so

226
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,930
you can see what's happening now

227
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,310
normally you'd allow the user to enter

228
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,839
text in there while the app is running

229
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,360
but to save having to type in a load of

230
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,220
text in the emulator I'm going to pay

231
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,930
some text into the text property here

232
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,910
instead and press Enter

233
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,470
and that text is available in the

234
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,730
resources section of

235
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,950
so that so you can do that yourself as

236
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,170
well if you're following along so I'm

237
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,250
going to come over here to the text

238
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,230
again I'm making sure that I'm not

239
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,610
clicking on the text with the wrench and

240
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,050
I'm going to paste in the text and press enter

241
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,850
now it doesn't expand until the layout

242
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,130
height property is set to wrap content

243
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,920
so if you add a text widget isn't set to

244
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,780
wrap content then you'll want to change

245
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,300
it now in my case you can see that it is

246
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,500
set at the moment to wrap content all

247
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,910
right it so that wasn't really quite

248
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,100
what I had in mind now I wanted the

249
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,400
widget to expand to fill its text but I

250
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,140
definitely don't want it extending that

251
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,270
far down the screen so the mini

252
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,310
challenge is to work out why it's done

253
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,110
that and what we should do to prevent

254
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,390
that from happening so I'm going to end

255
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,100
the video here now I'm going to leave

256
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,420
you to see if you can come up with a

257
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,490
solution to that problem and in the next

258
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,440
video we'll start by going through how

259
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,630
to resolve it, so I'll see you in the

260
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,050
next video.
