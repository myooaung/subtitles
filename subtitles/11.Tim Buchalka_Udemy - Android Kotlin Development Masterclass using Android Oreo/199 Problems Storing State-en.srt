1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,130
All right.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,160
So we're now ready to run the app again to see how it behaves.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,550
We're going to do that and talk about what's wrong with the code.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,150
So we need to say firstly have the app behaves from scratch.

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,440
So I'm going to get back to me later and I'm going to delete this app so I was starting from a clean

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,090
slate.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,650
And when I installed that

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,610
and I'll run it again.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,680
And open a locket so that we can see what's going on.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:41,290
So the first test that we want to do here is to see how it behaves when we deny access and it's going

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,720
to be the size of a little bit more so I can say a bit more than look

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:52,670
what I said the first test is going to be to see how it behaves when you deny access.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,960
So I'm going to click on tonight and now when I click on the FAP it should display a snack bar and the

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,030
link there to grant access which it is.

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,560
And that should continue to appear whenever we click the FAP.

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,420
So if I spot that on screen the snack bar click it again comes back again which is good which is the

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,590
expected behavior.

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,840
And then the look that you can see I'm doing that the Fab's on click method starting and ending.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,130
All right so let's see now what happens when the grant access link is clicked.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,910
So the LOLcat Now you can see has the on click method starting again this time a call to request permissions

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,090
and then the on click method ending.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,240
And as a result we've got the Android door locked asking for permission to access the contacts want

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,710
to come out of the human click on denie can we say permission refused either here in the log.

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,470
We now request permissions result.

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,790
Callback is code.

26
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,440
So let's do that again.

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,270
But this time I click on grant access I'm going to check the don't ask again check box and click on

28
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,790
tonight.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,890
Now effectively what I've done is told and tried not to ask again.

30
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:09,780
So in terms of our code the to should show request permission or rationale should now return false.

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,140
So in other words this bit of codein he should never be executed.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,860
So let's actually check that I going to click on the fabric button again come from Texas and you can

33
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,030
see what's happened in this case.

34
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,610
That card was executed and the settings for the application is now showing on the screen again so that

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,880
it's working well and looking up to look at it.

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,130
And here is what you can say that you're showing on the screen the package academy to learn programming

37
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,310
to our content provider example so that you are all together with the action on the school application

38
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,730
on the school.

39
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,820
Details on the school setting family that were used in seduction that sits well lets rather Android

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,540
open the settings for this app rather than just going into the mind settings screen.

41
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,620
And that is tiny here also in the alog that the snack bars on click method has finished.

42
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,700
So they can say the snack bar on click and entry after the launching of the settings and you'll see

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,900
why that's important in the moment.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,010
Back in my lap I'm going to click on permissions and then I'm going to grant access to our contacts

45
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,330
are turning that on what's that and that tapping back a few times to take us back to our app which is

46
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,000
done here now but not a set up when doing that.

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,160
Nothing's appeared over here in the log.

48
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,230
The app now has the permission it needs but it doesn't know that it has got that permission.

49
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,050
So I could say basically at this point when I've tapped the fabric in the snack bar still appearing

50
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,490
instead of a contact details and if I quit the app closes down and run it again.

51
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,660
And click on a button.

52
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,700
It is actually working correctly and you can say in fact that permission is granted now showing in our

53
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,620
location.

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,770
But really that's not the best user experience requiring the user to shut down the app and started up

55
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,560
again in order to proceed.

56
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,560
So let's actually have a look at the code to see what's going wrong here.

57
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,400
So the actual problem is caused by the test in the Fab's unclick method.

58
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,830
This is the card here.

59
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
Basically the line 46.

60
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,650
So if you used read granted here to still whether we have access or not but we haven't updated it after

61
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,880
going into the settings.

62
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,210
So consequently it actually filed there had returned false and we were able to get access to our contacts

63
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,960
until we closed down the up and started it again.

64
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,080
Now what kind of site never store state in a variable like we've done here.

65
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,610
But what I will say is I think long and hard before doing so.

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,280
Sometimes it can be necessary but generally it's much harder to check the site when you need it rather

67
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,220
than storing it in a field as we've done here.

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,990
And the problem we've got here is that we check to see if we had access in the uncreate method and set

69
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,370
rate granted to True or false to reflect the state of our access.

70
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,120
But dead in the request permission was so Kolpak method.

71
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,790
We also set it to true squint and have a look at that.

72
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,550
This one he got starting on law 91.

73
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,740
So he also said that if access is granted after calling request permissions so that means that the would

74
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,780
work after tapping allowed in the.

75
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,760
But our code that launches the app settings has no way of knowing whether the user granted access or

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,810
not.

77
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,550
Now of course we know that they went into the settings because we sent them there.

78
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,790
But we've got no control over what they did when they got into the settings.

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,820
So it's very tempting to store things like whether you have a particular permission and it's also very

80
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,470
common.

81
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,370
But once you start doing that you'll find yourself adding more code to keep the variable up to digest

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,780
changes we saw earlier that the snack bars on click method ends where the user is still in the settings.

83
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,270
So we don't really have a convenient way to check the permissions again.

84
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,650
So good rule is if you want to know the state of your environment then chicken each time you need to

85
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,800
know rather than storing that state in a field.

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,940
So don't store the stype because you'll end up struggling to keep your stored value up to date.

87
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:20,820
Or what's ahead.

88
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,950
Got about fixing that.

89
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,070
Well let's work on that in the next video.
