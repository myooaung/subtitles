00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.069

In this video we're gonna go ahead and



2

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.160

download and install the JDK which is



3

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.930

the Java development kit which contains



4

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.700

the software to be able to run programs



5

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.799

in this course. Now if you're



6

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.500

running on a Mac or a Linux machine you



7

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.480

want to check out a specific video that



8

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.550

we've created in this section of the



9

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.040

course for those operating systems the



10

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.329

reason is the steps are slightly



11

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.160

different for each platform so this is



12

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.050

the windows video so if you're on



13

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.590

Windows unico start by going to Java dot



14

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.250

IO cool calm they'll bring into a page



15

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.860

from Oracle which are now the owners of



16

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.290

the Java product when I come over here



17

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.360

under technologies and click on Java SE



18

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.890

and once that page loads come over here



19

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.610

and click on downloads and finally once



20

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.470

we get to that page there's this little



21

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.360

icon here this little word image and



22

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.720

it'll say Java platform JDK and a number



23

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.970

here now it's highly likely that this



24

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.159

number will change in the future because



25

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.020

Oracle release at regular intervals



26

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.990

updates to the Java development kit so



27

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.130

if you've got a later number than that



28

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.249

that's fine just click on the graphic



29

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:15.259

there and that'll take you to the



30

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.909

download page where we can actually



31

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.369

download the software now what we need



32

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.709

to do is determine whether your computer



33

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:25.399

is of 32 or is running a 32 or 64-bit



34

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.829

version of Windows the reason for that



35

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.899

is that there's two versions of the JDK



36

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.389

available you can see here windows x86



37

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:36.380

and Windows x64 so what that means is



38

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.020

windows x86 is for computers running a



39

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.270

32-bit version of Windows and Windows



40

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.380

x64 is the 64-bit version of Windows so



41

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.549

to find out which version you're running



42

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.529

on your computer you basically want to



43

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.719

get into control panel or from Windows



44

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.429

10 it's settings so I'm going to come



45

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.109

down here I've clicked on the start icon



46

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.079

click on settings once you get into the



47

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.670

control panel or in my case windows



48

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.099

settings click on system and then it's



49

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.380

an option down here for about that's



50

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.599

certainly what it is for Windows 10 it



51

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.979

might be slightly different for older



52

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.569

versions of Windows but there's an



53

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.369

option on all versions of Windows to



54

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.780

tell you what version of Windows you're



55

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.420

running and here on a system type you



56

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.370

can see that it says 64-bit operating



57

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.510

system so ignore this part of the



58

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.540

right where it says x64 based processor



59

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.209

because it is possible confusingly to



60

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.700

have a 64-bit processor but to be



61

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.310

running a 32-bit version of the Windows



62

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.420

operating system



63

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.579

so the bit the important bit here is to



64

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.379

the left where it says 64-bit operating



65

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.690

system that tells me there that I'm



66

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.370

running a 64-bit version of the



67

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.500

operating system and I can now choose my



68

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.390

download the only other option that



69

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.579

would come up would be a 32-bit version



70

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.950

and once you know that you can close



71

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.109

that screen down come back to the page



72

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.959

that we loaded previously and choose the



73

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.540

relevant version now before they allow



74

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.129

you to download you need to click on



75

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.139

accept license agreement this little



76

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.569

radio button that you saw me click and



77

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.519

then we need to choose the version so a



78

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.379

32-bit version that would be the windows



79

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.159

x86 version in my case 64 million 64-bit



80

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.040

version or 64-bit edition of Windows so



81

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.150

I'm going to click on that little option



82

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.720

there for me



83

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.220

so you'll choose whichever one is



84

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.500

appropriate and I'm going to click on



85

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.650

run to elect our windows run this so



86

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.930

that we can go ahead and install it so



87

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.069

I'll just fast forward this while it



88

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.610

continues so that completes the Download



89

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.830

okay so I've gone ahead and the download



90

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.120

is finished and it started because I



91

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.160

selected it to run now if he didn't



92

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.960

select run you might have to double



93

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.020

click the download a program to start it



94

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.910

but in any event it should start I'm



95

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.290

going to close in the browser cuz we no



96

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.630

longer need it and you get a process



97

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.250

like this an installation process that



98

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.050

we can actually go through so come



99

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.930

through here now I can click on next



100

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.190

now you may actually need to know this



101

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.680

letter in the course so just say keep to



102

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.210

the back your mind or perhaps write down



103

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.600

the area or the path that this software



104

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.130

has been installed in you can see in my



105

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.470

case it's going to be installed in C



106

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.900

colon backslash Program Files backslash



107

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.880

Java and then this number will relate to



108

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.700

the version that you downloaded the



109

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.380

important part is Program Files slash



110

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.810

Java so you may need may or may not need



111

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.540

that later in the course but I have a



112

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.830

make a mental note of that or write it



113

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.170

down so you know click on next we don't



114

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.210

need to change any options there well it



115

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.740

do its thing and install



116

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.660

next thing it does its installed the JDK



117

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.169

but it's also wants to install the JRE



118

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.810

JRE stands for the Java Runtime Edition



119

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.539

and you do need to have both things on



120

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.190

your computer in order to be able to use



121

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.130

Java so we're going to just click on next



122

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.979

noting that that directory the C colon



123

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.830

backslash program files slash Java so



124

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.820

it's actually putting it in a different



125

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.440

subfolder and again you may need that



126

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.360

too later in the course click on next



127

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.400

and let it do its thing again



128

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.600

all right so at this point so you can



129

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.160

see that it's come up and said the java



130

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.070

SE development kit 8 update and then the



131

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.840

number has been successfully installed



132

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.580

so we're actually done so I'm click on



133

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.680

close and I'm going to finish the video



134

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.420

here let's move on to the next one.
