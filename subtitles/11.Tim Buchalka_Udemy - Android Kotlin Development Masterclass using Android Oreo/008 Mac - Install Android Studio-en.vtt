00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.819

In this video, we're going to download



2

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.430

and install Android studio which is the



3

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.840

program we're going to be using in this



4

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.610

course to write our Android applications.



5

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.859

Now just a reminder that this is the Mac



6

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.170

video so if you're running a Windows or



7

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.910

Linux machine then there's separate



8

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.769

videos you can follow along with and



9

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.480

watch for those operating systems in



10

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.579

this section of the course but if you're



11

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.079

using a Mac you're on the right place.



12

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:26.949

So let's get started



13

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.409

now you can install Android studio by



14

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:35.170

going to developer.android.com or you



15

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.700

could have typed android studio into



16

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.710

your search engine to find the link and



17

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.450

when you get here there's an option down



18

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.040

here to get into on studio so I can



19

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.640

click on that and it should recognize



20

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.110

that you're on a Mac automatically which



21

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.790

it has for me I can click on download



22

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.910

Android studio I can agree to the terms



23

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.830

and conditions by checking the check box



24

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.970

and click on the download button we're



25

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.350

going to save this and we'll just pause



26

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.940

the video now - this is actually



27

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.610

downloaded and actually while that's



28

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.290

downloading one thing to be aware of is



29

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.440

that this new version of Android studio



30

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.300

version 3.0 is very different to the



31

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.460

previous version and it has a number of



32

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.020

new features that weren't available in



33

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.909

that earlier version so things like the



34

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.250

new layout designer for example so you



35

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.740

will need to be using Android studio 3.0



36

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.650

or higher for this course now if you've



37

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.630

already got Android studio 2.3 installed



38

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.360

you'll still need to install this 3.0



39

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.670

version for this course in Android



40

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.560

studio 2.3 will automatically update



41

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.630

itself so make sure you install the



42

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.520

update when it's offered



43

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.079

all right so you can see that in the



44

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.729

bottom left hand corner it's downloaded



45

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.560

for me now so I'm going to open the dmg



46

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.780

file so you'll never get to the folder



47

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.790

if you can't open it the way I have in



48

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.530

the Chrome browser we'll give it a



49

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.560

moment to start up and to install it



50

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.720

we'll just drag the Android studio icon



51

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.119

over to applications and you can see



52

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.900

this is actually copying into applications



53

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.010

now that we've done that we can close



54

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.630

down the Installer and we can close down



55

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.050

the browser then what I can do is just



56

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.380

open finder go to applications and I can



57

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.310

double click Android studio to open it



58

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.690

you can see that it's verifying Android



59

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.190

studio so I'll just close on the finder



60

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.410

what it's doing that and we may be



61

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.020

prompted with a security error and if



62

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:35.640

that's the case I'll show you how to fix that



63

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.930

ok we're going to click on open to open



64

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.459

Android studio after it's verified we're



65

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.019

going to select do not import settings



66

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.120

and we don't need to do that because



67

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.590

we're not importing from a previous



68

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.640

version of Android studio so click on ok



69

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.379

now that's security exception you may



70

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.909

get a security error the first time you



71

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.579

install this and if that's the case I'll



72

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.870

just show you quickly what you need to



73

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.290

do if you do get that security error and



74

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.489

you just come over here and click on and



75

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.390

go into system preferences then you go



76

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.660

into security and privacy and go into



77

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.940

general and on this screen here there'll



78

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.530

be little option that says words to the



79

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.329

effect of we couldn't open Android



80

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.579

studio and to open anyway and you'll



81

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.859

click on open anyway from there and that



82

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.629

will open Android studio for you but in



83

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.159

my case I didn't get that exception so I



84

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.680

don't need to do it so Android studio



85

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.690

went through and looked for the step the



86

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.340

software development kit repository to



87

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.870

figure out what it needs to install on



88

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.239

your computer or rather it downloaded it



89

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.099

from the Google services then we've got



90

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.690

this wizard so I'm going to click on



91

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.329

next you've got an option to go into



92

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.609

standard or custom so we can just leave



93

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.639

it on standard then click on next we've



94

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.829

got an option here to choose which theme



95

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.019

we want to use and it's basically the



96

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.150

background color and does color all the



97

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.739

fonts I'm going to leave it on the



98

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.180

default but if you wanted to you could



99

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.769

choose dark yellow and get a darker



100

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.480

looking theme which is probably a little



101

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.099

bit better on the eyes but I'll stick



102

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.200

with the default and I'm going to click



103

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.620

on next so next we've got a review of



104

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.359

the settings and what's going to be yeah



105

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.489

downloaded and installed for us so I'm



106

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.389

going to leave everything on the



107

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.019

defaults there and click on finish and



108

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.980

then I'm going to click on show details



109

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.690

that just shows us so what's actually



110

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.150

downloading so what I'm going to do now



111

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.160

is pause the video and we'll come back



112

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.050

once the download is complete then just



113

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.300

bear in mind that the download can be



114

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.580

quite large depending on the components



115

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.530

selected and can take a significant



116

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.139

amount of time depending on the speed of



117

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.599

your computer and also the speed of your



118

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.490

internet connection well pause the video



119

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.590

and we'll come back once the download is complete



120

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.210

all right so the installations been



121

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.650

proceeding and we got to the point now



122

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.160

what's running the Intel haxon installer



123

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.390

so what we need to do is it's wanting me



124

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.040

to enter my password so I'm going to do that



125

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.900

that's the password to this account now



126

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.160

by the way you may sometimes get a



127

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.500

dialog asking you to retry at some point



128

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.110

that happens just click retry and that's



129

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.580

because sometimes the downloading of



130

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.080

some components fails for no apparent



131

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.380

reason and retrying it should fix it now



132

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.640

sometimes it does take more than one



133

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.410

retry and I've got no idea why perhaps



134

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.360

something to do with being a busy



135

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.850

network at Google's end and what's this



136

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.440

hack some installation is finished we



137

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.610

just want to check to make sure that's



138

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.740

installed because if there's an error



139

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.720

with hexam and it's not installed properly



140

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.000

we may see an error and I'm just going



141

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.770

to bring up a slide to show you the



142

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.230

error that you may see so you can see



143

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.150

here that this is an error that says



144

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.820

that it couldn't install Intel hexam so



145

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.110

if you see something like that you won't



146

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.390

be able to take advantage of the hex of



147

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.760

acceleration features when you run your



148

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.740

emulator so in the next video when we



149

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.540

configure the SDK you'll need to install



150

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.150

the a RM emulators instead of the x86



151

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.490

ones now the emulator will still work



152

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.980

but will be a lot slower than an x86



153

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.680

emulator running hexam now what are max



154

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.540

using Intel processors should have



155

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.150

virtualization enabled so if you get a



156

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.190

problem it's worth checking at this page



157

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.260

on the Apple support site if that's the



158

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.970

only error then Android studio and the



159

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.400

SDK is installed and we can continue and



160

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.860

click finish but let's go back and see



161

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.570

how the Android studio installation side



162

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.130

proceeded



163

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.870

and get it back to here now you can see



164

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.540

it says silent installation pass so



165

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.190

that's our confirmation that haxon was



166

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.350

installed correctly we've also got to



167

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.180

everything else seemingly installed



168

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.530

there's no errors that we can see there



169

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.920

at this point we can click on finish and



170

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.860

the Android studio 3.0 installation has



171

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.170

actually completed now in the next video



172

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.040

in this section we're going to be



173

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.770

looking at configuring Android studio so



174

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.360

the steps from now on are largely the



175

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.430

same regardless of which operating



176

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.330

system you're using



177

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.310

so skip over the next few videos which



178

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.990

relate to a Linux installation and



179

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.690

installing the java jdk on 32-bit



180

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.910

systems so you won't need to do that if



181

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.290

you have successfully installed android



182

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.750
