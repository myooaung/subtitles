1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,120
Know we've got some contact details on Army lighters we can have a look now at how to access those contacts

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,070
using a content provider.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:19,100
Now the contex app has registered a content provider that allows apps to access the phone's contacts

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,610
provided they request the necessary permissions and the ransom of.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,440
And we're going to be saying how to do that as we wrought this app is going to start a new androids

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,790
Judaea project.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,760
So let's call this one content provider example

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,720
that's always include content support next.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:48,240
So make sure that IP I-17 next for this example where we're not going to bother to create our own patents.

10
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,770
We're going to keep things really simple.

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,250
And we're used to floating action button to load the contacts.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,780
So I get to choose a basic activity and click on next and this is just the names on this Laska configuration

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,590
screen in my case I'm going to click on Finnish Now once it finishes creating the project we're going

14
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,030
to start work on the content mine.

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,390
Ex-MIL fall and the only thing we really want to add to this content and it's called Meindert ex-MIL

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,840
file is the list view and that list is going to be used to display the contacts that were going to grab

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,050
from the content provider.

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,060
I guess I could say that content tells comment that accident was loaded automatically for some reason

19
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,940
it hadn't.

20
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,990
Then just open it as you would normally open it from here from the resources section in the folder.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,740
And I'm going to just close and the project painter to make a bit more spice.

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,590
And the other thing I'll do is I just I found by design and the blueprint so you can say both.

23
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,360
Now we're going to be first is to late the hello world.

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,980
The text widget so I won't be using that.

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,620
And as I mentioned we're going to be using enlistee widget.

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,450
So let's grab that this you a piece down here and the legacy that's probably an indication Barnabei

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,100
that Google is planning to deprecated at some point but that's not something I'm worried about.

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,110
For this simple app but you might want to consider that possibility when writing your own apps.

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,500
Are going to rebel to view.

30
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,560
Bring it here and release.

31
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,930
So went to Lescure to fill the available space.

32
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,870
These buttons up here in the inspect that make it easy to add at the constraints for us automatically.

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,140
So we got to use the file all the values spice and the other thing we need to do then is to set the

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,930
lay up and lay out heart.

35
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,360
I suppose both within that constraint.

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,900
So if we just sit and Streitz or the next we want to check the scrollbars and want to make sure that

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,160
that set to vertical.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,480
So I'm going to come over here and click on scrollbars not set for me in this case I'm going to click

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,170
on vertical.

40
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,510
So I've got a vertical scroll bar there for Eliz to you.

41
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,120
OK.

42
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,480
So I lay with the last heart by a set to match constraint.

43
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,240
So the next thing to do is to change your day.

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,730
We want to actually cause one contact tonight because we'll be needing to refer to that in our code.

45
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,020
And now there's one other thing to check and we can tell this by looking at the screen whether it's

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,040
said or not.

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,010
And that's the layout of the school behavior property of the constraint lab.

48
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,960
So obviously want to come over here and click on the constraint layout that would be where you said

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,380
it.

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,110
But it is a toolbar saw space at the top of the lap which you can see there obviously is in both the

51
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,330
design and the blueprint that we know that everything's fine.

52
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,300
But for some reason you need to set that so it's not something you actually clicked on the constraint

53
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,210
out you come over here you will attributes and you do a quick search for this or you can just scroll

54
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,980
down to the relevant section.

55
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,500
So search and going to search for life behavior of

56
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,210
behaviors and lay it on margin.

57
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,070
This is the behavior and you can see in this case you can't quite read it all.

58
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,840
But it is actually set to by scrawling the lowest scores scrolling and it's called view on the score

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,840
behavior.

60
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,420
So it's not set for some reason that click there and then click on the little ellipses button and you

61
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,890
could choose the APA and score scrolling go to school behavior.

62
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,520
But in my case because I can see the toolbar at the top we know that that is set.

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,960
So that's good to go.

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,320
Right so that's the lay up finish to this point.

65
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,700
So I'll come back in here and just

66
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,820
just make sure that they're set correctly.

67
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,450
Era

68
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,180
that's a bug or what's going on there but we seem to have two versions of much constraint showing the

69
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,650
slide back and select the other one

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,700
that seems to fix it so I'm not sure what's going on there.

71
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,820
But if you do see something like that looks like a bug to me.

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,130
Just make sure you set the other constraints how that actually works and fixes the text that fixes the

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,200
Exxon-Mobile.

74
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:58,540
So I can select that X and now click on code and does select reformat code even though there wasn't

75
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,660
really much to format it's there so that when you get to the stage of needing to compare your as it's

76
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,000
going to be the same or what's another format of the kite.

77
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,900
We can move onto the layout for the individual items that will appear in the list view.

78
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,370
Now if you want to experiment with displaying Moorfields from the contacts database once we finish this

79
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,170
up then please do so is a good idea to experiment.

80
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,830
That's a great way to further your understanding of Android app development or any programming language

81
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,570
or environment for that matter.

82
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,620
And it really will help you make sure that you really help make sure you understand these videos.

83
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,180
But I'm just going to display a single file.

84
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,000
Context name.

85
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,510
So this next line we're about to create when I opened the project pane first then we're got to right

86
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:49,710
click on the layout you're going to select lab resource fall so because we just playing just a single

87
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,690
context nine.

88
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,280
We only need the one field and we're just going to use a text.

89
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,000
So I'm going to call this one contact on a school day.

90
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,610
So the read element I'm going to change is not going to be because layout is literally just going to

91
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,960
be a text view.

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,650
So I'm going to select text you because it's the single name that society is having to change again

93
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,540
anytime later.

94
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,370
Or what's the first thing you want to do is come over here and click on the text you are going was going

95
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:24,270
to close a pain so we're going spice back selecting text to adhere to the left and the componentry the

96
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:34,220
ID Initially I would call that name and also add some sample text text few in the tools text property.

97
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,700
We talked about what that was before so that way those still show up in the lap of the text you weren't

98
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,150
containing the sample text.

99
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:50,120
When the app runs so the width and height width is correct on Match parent but her heart should be changed.

100
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,550
We want that to be content to and that's the reason we're doing that is to allow very long names to

101
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,550
still feel OK.

102
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,860
So that's all we really need.

103
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,240
But what I will do is to one last thing and change the text size to 18 like to be bigger than normal.

104
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,170
The text size doesn't try to make sure you're expanding the text appearance section.

105
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,940
He so that you can see that what's that.

106
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,890
So you say it's a very basic layout.

107
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,700
What I'm doing now is I'm going to get access to the text to the ex-American select that I'm going to

108
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:27,590
reformat the code you know back to design again and I'm going to close this up for now because I want

109
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,960
to close that because other continents coal as well just leaving just purely out Cartland code.

110
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:40,180
OK so we're now ready to add the common code to retrieve the context data using a content provider and

111
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,800
we'll do that in the next video.
