1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,060
Alright so continuing on now we need

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,700
to add our text view to our layout.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,710
Now the text view goes below the plain text

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,170
widget and let's go ahead and do that so

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,390
text view I'm gonna put it directly

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,900
below. Now this should have constraints

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,150
to the left and right edges of the

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,860
screen so let's go ahead and do that so

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,120
you can see that the left constraints

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,800
have been added for me automatically so

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,910
I'm going to add a constraint to the

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,590
right edge of the screen as well for it

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,570
then we're also going to constrain its

14
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,670
top to the bottom of the plain text

15
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,649
widget and then the bottom to the bottom

16
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:37,420
edge of the layout so let's go ahead and

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,909
do that and by the way auto-connect

18
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,710
probably won't create the right hand

19
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,230
bottom constraints it has in my case so

20
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,399
we're going to be doing that manually

21
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,480
and then it will probably be the case

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,370
for you as well so I'll start off with a

23
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,109
top constraint or constrain it to the

24
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:53,170
plain text and the bottom constraint to

25
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,559
the bottom of the layout like so now we

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,239
want to feel what's left on the screen

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,359
so the horizontal or vertical sizes for

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,519
this textview should both be set to

29
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,670
match constraint now when I go back to

30
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,950
our normal view of attributes instead of

31
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,320
the extent of view and you've seen me do

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,790
this before but we can change these here

33
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,160
and click on Matt's constraint and do it

34
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,680
that way or if it could have gone up and

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,930
actually clicked on the button the inner

36
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,330
lines as we've done in we could have

37
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,890
clicked on the inner lines up here and

38
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,450
to do the yo to achieve the same thing

39
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,090
as well you can see here that we also

40
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,590
want to check the margins the margins

41
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,990
are set correctly to 16 for top left or

42
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,180
right and bottom and by the way might

43
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,430
seem quicker to set all rather than each

44
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,530
one separately but don't do that at the

45
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,420
moment anyway there's a great way to

46
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,370
fall foul of the bug I've just mentioned

47
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,530
in the previous video because right and

48
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,040
start won't be explicitly set so to see

49
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,540
what I mean I'm going to come back over

50
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,940
to go back into the extended attributes

51
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,030
again and if we look in our margins

52
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,270
layout margin again there's this option

53
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,460
I'm talking about a setting all so we'll

54
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,750
do that and I'll show you what I mean so

55
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,010
you click on that and type in 16 DP

56
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,800
press Enter and you can see that right

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,220
and start weren't actually updated so

58
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,540
everything's still looking okay though

59
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,150
but if I go back to our normal

60
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,840
attributes

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,910
and then if I change the left margin' to

62
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,550
ATP you can see that the margin was

63
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,950
immediately set back to 16 and try it

64
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,220
again now it may or may not be changed

65
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,470
immediately like it is for me here if

66
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,500
you click on another control and then go

67
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,480
back to the text view again or the

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,560
locker you'll find that it will have

69
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,260
changed back to the original value 16 in

70
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,750
this case by doing that in other words

71
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,510
it gets reset back to 16 DP again so the

72
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,890
better way of doing it is to go back in

73
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,290
to the extended attributes again and

74
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,730
have a look and you can see still see

75
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,019
here that we've got the full bottom and

76
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,549
left and top set but right and staff

77
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,950
aren't set to anything and you might

78
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,060
find that things work slightly

79
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,670
differently for you and again this is

80
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,930
probably partially due to the fact that

81
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,940
we're currently running in these videos

82
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,760
a preview version of Android studio so

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
it's a bit annoying and hopefully

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,640
they'll get it fixed at some point but

85
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,110
at least you know saved from the

86
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,819
frustration of working out what's going

87
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,110
on and you can just set the margins in

88
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,209
in here so I'm going to change all of

89
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,110
these back now

90
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:29,030
to 16 DP and that should cure things and

91
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,640
there won't be any problems later on now

92
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,620
because of that all right go back to our

93
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,319
normal attributes now all right now for

94
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,120
our textview we know what the widget to

95
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,160
be centered it should start at the top

96
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,989
of the screen and the text should flow

97
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,299
down from there as necessary so we're

98
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:45,890
going to drag both the horizontal and

99
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,010
vertical sliders to left so first one

100
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,859
top for vertical and then left for

101
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,290
horizontal to achieve that and we've got

102
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,720
this bug here that will pop up from time

103
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,250
to time where I went allow me to change

104
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,910
the bias I was a little biased a zero

105
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,049
but we'll leave that as it is for now

106
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,910
anyway and one of those bugs that we

107
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,489
hope will get fixed soon by Google all

108
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:12,380
right now we need to check the margins

109
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,630
which we've done to make sure that both

110
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,720
sets left and right left and started

111
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,150
writing in we're all set to 16 DP now

112
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,430
you saw me set those just a minute or so

113
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,840
ago in this video so now that they're

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,030
correct so that's almost it at this

115
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,550
point the only other thing we want to do

116
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,010
is make the textview to be scrollable so

117
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,820
what we need to do

118
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,240
expand the property pane and we need to

119
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,030
go down to scroll bars and we'll set the

120
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,460
scroll bars to vertical and then we want

121
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,990
to set the scroll indicators to write an

122
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,180
end so scroll bars first to vertical as

123
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,380
you can see that's been sent now and

124
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,360
then scroll indicators I want to set

125
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,840
those to right and end like so right so

126
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,280
this point we can now run the app and

127
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,900
although it doesn't do a lot we should

128
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,350
find that it does display correctly

129
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,790
hopefully in both portrait and landscape

130
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,870
all right so let's try running the up

131
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:15,470
here and obviously at this point in time

132
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,480
the apps not going to do a lot but we

133
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,800
can hopefully determine that it does

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,400
look okay in both portrait and landscape

135
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,199
all right so there's our app in portrait

136
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,490
mode and if I go into landscape mode

137
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,620
just click on done there so you can see

138
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,759
what it looks like you can see that it's

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,259
looking okay in both portrait and

140
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,270
landscape so I'll just return that back

141
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,520
to portrait mode it's working well all

142
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,229
right so there's one final change that

143
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,449
we want to make and that's to the IDs

144
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:49,210
that are used for the widgets if I go

145
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,520
back to the button click on the button

146
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,580
over here back in the blueprint and we

147
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,330
want to have a look over in the

148
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,830
inspector I'm just going to go back to

149
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,949
our normal attributes we can see here

150
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,680
that the buttons been given an ID in

151
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,680
this case the IDS button - and it may

152
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,940
have a number at the end or it may not

153
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,699
you might just have the ID button there

154
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,020
Android studio generates IDs

155
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,240
automatically and uses the type of the

156
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,979
widget and a number if there's more than

157
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,840
one or if you've deleted one and added

158
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,599
another now that's not often the best

159
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,460
name to use for things though so

160
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,629
throughout the course we're going to

161
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,400
change these IDs that are given to the

162
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,650
widgets automatically you know for this

163
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,569
example button is an acceptable ID

164
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,370
because we really only have one of each

165
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,440
kind of widget in this layout and it

166
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,300
will be useful to easily tell which one

167
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,370
is which while we're learning now

168
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,539
there's no need to have the number at

169
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:39,039
the end though if there is one as IMI's

170
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,650
in my case so I'm going to go through

171
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,379
each widget and look for a number and if

172
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,159
there's a number that I'm going to

173
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,509
remove it so in this case I'm going to

174
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,479
just change button to - button and press

175
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,669
enter now you may get this prompted you

176
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,469
can see on the screen there now asking

177
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:56,050
if you want to update usages as well you

178
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,849
know clicking yes to that will make sure

179
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,339
that anything relating or referring to

180
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,979
the ID will also be updated now it's

181
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,839
very rare that you won't want to do that

182
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,270
so we want to click on yes and in fact

183
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,620
we'll look at one reason why you may

184
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,839
want to answer no later in the course so

185
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,389
I'm going to click on yes to that I'm

186
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,240
going to do the same for the two other

187
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,490
widgets I'm going to do the edit text

188
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,990
it's got to always been labeled as edit

189
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,029
text too so let's delete the two on the

190
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,639
end of that press ENTER and click on yes

191
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,830
I'll click yes and likewise for the

192
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,440
textview textview too so I'll get rid of

193
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,229
the number on the end let's enter now

194
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:33,880
that one has an actually actually asked

195
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,569
us to update so that's fine

196
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:37,339
all right so we've done that but till

197
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,719
you might be out wondering now what is

198
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:41,300
this ID well when we come to writing

199
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,339
code to get the button to do something

200
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,020
we're going to have to refer to the

201
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,020
various widgets now it's this ID that we

202
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,449
use so that Android knows which one

203
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,969
we're referring to in the code so as you

204
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:55,009
saw I change I made sure that the IDS of

205
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,749
the edit text and text few widgets are

206
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:58,639
set to edit text and textview

207
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,830
respectively and obviously button as

208
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,419
well so let's actually go and have a

209
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:05,360
look at the XML code for this layout now

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,339
to see the XML code come over here to

211
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:12,110
the text tab and click on that you can

212
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,389
see here that it appears in an XML

213
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,990
Android ID attribute it's over here for

214
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,449
button and one for inner text and is

215
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,719
also one for the textview as well

216
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,039
so looking at the button we can see the

217
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,619
android ID the value for the button

218
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:30,439
widget is the ampersand plus ID slash

219
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,479
and in button I'm looking at the code on

220
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,209
line 13 now you'll see the use of the @

221
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,880
symbol a lot when referring to resources

222
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,279
and it's just the syntax that Android

223
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,529
uses to refer to a resource that's

224
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,959
stored in the res folder although some

225
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,490
resources are part of the Android SDK

226
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,060
that as well Android SDK to you know

227
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,209
ampersand + ID just means that whatever

228
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,970
follows is an ID rather than any other

229
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,100
type of resource well actually it means

230
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,620
a bit more than that the @ ID would mean

231
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,050
that it was an ID but the + tells

232
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,730
Android that it doesn't already exist

233
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,040
and that this is the resource that

234
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,880
defines it

235
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,130
so Android studio will automatically

236
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,990
make sure that the ID button in this

237
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,689
case appears in the relevant file so

238
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,639
that it can be found and the same goes

239
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,170
for the other two widgets so that we've

240
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,480
got in our layout the other text and the

241
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,060
text view and you can see in the XML how

242
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,990
the ids are used in the constraints so

243
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,350
the button is constrained to the top of

244
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,470
something with the ID parent to

245
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,899
constraint top to top off here on line

246
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,360
20 I'm looking at now although that used

247
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,160
to be the name of the layout activity

248
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,050
and that's called main in this case now

249
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,670
the edit text widget we're going to only

250
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,529
have a look at that there's kind of

251
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,199
constraint layout constraint right

252
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,400
underscore to left off so you can

253
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,400
see off you can see their online 35 or

254
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,110
maybe and underscore to start off as

255
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,750
well and that refers to the ID button

256
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,990
you can see here on line 34 ampersand +

257
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,150
OD / button so the right edge is

258
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,190
constrained to the very left of the

259
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,810
button now there's a bit of

260
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,420
inconsistency here and the constraint

261
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,160
attribute might be layout and a score

262
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,830
constraint end underscore to start off

263
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,170
as it is in my particular case it

264
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,430
doesn't matter which and there's no need

265
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,110
to duplicate these lines as we did for

266
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,150
the margins now if you're wondering why

267
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,940
it's not necessary here there were no

268
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,010
constraints in earlier Android versions

269
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,190
so they weren't expecting any attributes

270
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,960
so the constraint layouts been added to

271
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,970
the older Android versions and works

272
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,580
with either left / right or start / end

273
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,740
now don't worry if that doesn't make

274
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,570
much sense I'm gonna be seeing it in you

275
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,130
soon and it should become much clearer

276
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,590
there's also no need to change the XML

277
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,660
directly as everything can be done from

278
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,210
the designer now now you may or may not

279
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,700
see this on your screen but I've

280
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,320
actually got some warnings in the XML

281
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,720
for the button and the textview Android

282
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,280
studio is complaining about layout on

283
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,900
school Martin right being redundant

284
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,580
because we've already specified the

285
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,560
layout and it's got margin end and we're

286
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,810
targeting API 17 so I can just hover

287
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,970
over this then hover over a particular

288
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,740
line there that's giving you some live

289
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,170
information about that so it's true

290
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,640
actually because using write is only

291
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,610
necessary for API 16 and earlier but if

292
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,050
that's the case why don't we get the

293
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,880
same warning for the duplicated settings

294
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,470
in the inner text so it's a little bit

295
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,090
inconsistent at the moment and as I said

296
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,640
that's the nature of bugs that's not

297
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,750
something we really need to worry about

298
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,000
at this point in the course all right

299
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,190
now before I finish in the XML view I'm

300
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,920
gonna go up to the code menu and I'm

301
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,400
going to choose on reformat code or

302
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,740
select rather free format code and

303
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,750
didn't get anything changed because it

304
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,890
says the codes are really properly

305
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,250
formatted but you may or may not get that.

306
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,200
Now their option obviously reformats code

307
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,120
based on the name and it uses standard

308
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,520
indenting and it also sorts the various

309
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,130
XML attributes so that for example the

310
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,410
ID appears first so I'm going to be

311
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,210
reformatting the code at the end of all

312
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,190
the earlier videos because it'll make it

313
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,810
much easier for you to compare your

314
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,490
with mine and we'll talk a bit more

315
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,020
about that later when I show you how you

316
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,090
can get Android studio to help you check

317
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,190
your code. Alright so let's finish the

318
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,230
video here in the next video we're going

319
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,670
to start writing code to add some of

320
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,220
functionality to our design so I'll see

321
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,060
you in the next video.
