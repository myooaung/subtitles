Hello everyone and welcome to the solution for the first site mock interview question for the large

2

00:00:07.110  -->  00:00:09.110
search engine company.

3

00:00:09.180  -->  00:00:14.600
Just to reiterate what the question was given a dice which rose 1 to 7 with a uniform probability.

4

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:19.920
We wanted you to simulate a five sided dice and they prefer you write your solution as a function.

5

00:00:20.550  -->  00:00:23.500
So what's the solution here.

6

00:00:23.520  -->  00:00:24.780
So this is a new problem.

7

00:00:24.780  -->  00:00:29.280
We've never seen before at least in the course and many times this question is asked in the form of

8

00:00:29.290  -->  00:00:29.760
function.

9

00:00:29.760  -->  00:00:34.680
So given a function random 7 you have taken it as an input and create random 5.

10

00:00:34.710  -->  00:00:38.760
The key to solving this problem is actually focus on the requirement that the final distribution of

11

00:00:38.760  -->  00:00:40.170
the rules be uniform.

12

00:00:40.410  -->  00:00:44.210
Also you're actually not given any requirements on time and space.

13

00:00:44.310  -->  00:00:46.530
In that case the solution is really simple.

14

00:00:46.530  -->  00:00:49.710
You just keep rerolling if you get to them are greater than five.

15

00:00:50.070  -->  00:00:54.000
So to code this out Montigny life coding is pretty simple.

16

00:00:54.000  -->  00:00:57.200
Here we use from random import Rand I.A..

17

00:00:57.290  -->  00:01:01.230
That's just the random integer generator with uniform probability.

18

00:01:01.230  -->  00:01:04.290
And your solution is you start the roll at 7.

19

00:01:04.350  -->  00:01:06.200
It just needs to be larger than 5.

20

00:01:06.510  -->  00:01:14.250
And while the roll is greater than your roll and if your dice roll is above 7 you just keep doing it

21

00:01:14.250  -->  00:01:14.360
.

22

00:01:14.370  -->  00:01:15.500
Or excuse me above 5.

23

00:01:15.510  -->  00:01:20.560
You just keep doing it again and again until you get a roll a 5 or below.

24

00:01:21.120  -->  00:01:27.000
And so here you're just converting 4:53 by throwing out anything that's above five.

25

00:01:27.010  -->  00:01:28.650
Next problem is going to be a little trick here.

26

00:01:28.740  -->  00:01:30.600
The reverse conversion of the rolls.

27

00:01:31.050  -->  00:01:33.990
But this question should serve as a reminder for you not to over think.

28

00:01:33.990  -->  00:01:39.450
The solution to a question keep in mind that this solution here has the potential to keep running for

29

00:01:39.510  -->  00:01:43.980
infinity if you keep rolling sixes and sevens although that's highly unlikely.

30

00:01:43.980  -->  00:01:46.150
You can actually prove it mathematically.

31

00:01:46.200  -->  00:01:46.660
All right.

32

00:01:47.070  -->  00:01:50.540
Now in the next solution we'll discuss the reverse of this.

33

00:01:50.640  -->  00:01:53.670
Simulate a seven sided die given a five sided die.

34

00:01:53.990  -->  00:01:54.920
I'll see you there.
