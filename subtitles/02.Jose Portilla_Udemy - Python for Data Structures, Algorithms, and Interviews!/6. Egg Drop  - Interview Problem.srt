Hello everyone and welcome to the next riddle.

2

00:00:03,600  -->  00:00:08,970
This one's called eggdrop and it's probably the most common brainteaser slash riddle slash puzzle out

3

00:00:08,970  -->  00:00:10,010
of the entire group.

4

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:15,960
So really try to think using the algorithms we've learned about when trying to find a solution for this

5

00:00:15,960  -->  00:00:17,100
problem.

6

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:18,890
Here's the problem statement.

7

00:00:19,200  -->  00:00:23,570
There's a tower with 100 floors on it and you've been given two eggs.

8

00:00:23,610  -->  00:00:28,350
The eggs are strong enough that they can be dropped from a particular floor in the tower without breaking

9

00:00:28,350  -->  00:00:29,250
.

10

00:00:29,280  -->  00:00:34,620
You've been tasked to find the highest floor in a Can we drop that without breaking in a few drops as

11

00:00:34,620  -->  00:00:36,460
possible.

12

00:00:36,480  -->  00:00:42,090
This means if an egg is dropped from above its target floor that will break if it is dropped from that

13

00:00:42,090  -->  00:00:48,630
floor or below it will be intact and you can test drop the egg again on another floor.

14

00:00:48,630  -->  00:00:54,830
So show algorithmically how you would go about doing this in a few drops possible.

15

00:00:55,140  -->  00:01:01,280
So your answer should be the number of the fewest drops needed for testing two eggs on 100 floors and

16

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:06,540
finding the highest floor you can drop it at without the egg breaking.

17

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:07,710
OK.

18

00:01:07,950  -->  00:01:10,630
Best of luck and I'll see you at the next lecture.
