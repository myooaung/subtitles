00:00:01.890  -->  00:00:06.990
Hello everyone and welcome to the course material installation lecture for Windows and Microsoft users

2

00:00:07.470  -->  00:00:08.340
in this lecture.

3

00:00:08.340  -->  00:00:13.020
We're just going to be going over how to download Python and the Jupiter notebook system onto your computer

4

00:00:13.290  -->  00:00:17.630
in case you don't already have it later on in this same section.

5

00:00:17.640  -->  00:00:22.920
We'll get a much deeper introduction to the Jupiter notebooks how best to use them and also where to

6

00:00:22.920  -->  00:00:28.650
access the course material and those course notebooks as well as the interview in a mock interview notebooks

7

00:00:28.650  -->  00:00:29.280
.

8

00:00:29.340  -->  00:00:35.820
With that said let's go ahead and jump to the browser so we can download the materials.

9

00:00:35.820  -->  00:00:36.400
OK.

10

00:00:36.600  -->  00:00:42.470
So for everything we're going to be using in this course I highly recommend the Chrome browser.

11

00:00:42.470  -->  00:00:45.340
It really works best with the Jupiter notebooks.

12

00:00:45.360  -->  00:00:48.650
But let's first begin by installing it you bring up books.

13

00:00:48.860  -->  00:00:50.760
Go to your favorite browser.

14

00:00:50.790  -->  00:00:57.400
I highly recommend chrome or Mozilla Firefox and Taipan Jupiter into the Google search engine.

15

00:00:57.480  -->  00:01:00.270
So j u p y t e.

16

00:01:00.300  -->  00:01:05.520
Our search for it and the first link should take you to Jupiter dot org.

17

00:01:05.850  -->  00:01:10.350
You can go ahead and click that link and this is the Jupiter notebook Web site.

18

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:15.450
The Jupiter note book is essentially a web application that allows you to create and share documents

19

00:01:15.450  -->  00:01:20.860
that contain life code equations visualizations and explanatory text.

20

00:01:21.090  -->  00:01:26.370
Their uses include data cleaning and transformation numerical simulation statistical modeling machine

21

00:01:26.400  -->  00:01:32.640
learning and much more in this course we use them as the basis for all the interview practice problems

22

00:01:32.960  -->  00:01:36.890
as well as the notes that correspond to each of the video lectures.

23

00:01:36.960  -->  00:01:42.700
Once you're on your website on this Web site you can scroll down and you have two options here.

24

00:01:42.740  -->  00:01:45.730
Try it in your browser and install the notebook.

25

00:01:46.110  -->  00:01:50.840
Something that I want to know is that if you click try it in your browser we'll go ahead and open this

26

00:01:50.850  -->  00:01:52.550
in a new tab.

27

00:01:53.490  -->  00:01:56.150
It'll take you to try that Jupiter dot org.

28

00:01:56.460  -->  00:02:02.580
This will allow you to go ahead and try the Jupiter notebooks in your browser without installing anything

29

00:02:02.580  -->  00:02:03.180
.

30

00:02:03.180  -->  00:02:12.900
So you could just come to try that Jupiter or and then click here writes new Python 2 or Python 3 depending

31

00:02:12.900  -->  00:02:21.330
on what you want to use and you can go ahead and begin to immediately code in your browser and I'll

32

00:02:21.330  -->  00:02:22.750
run that cell.

33

00:02:22.920  -->  00:02:24.540
Now we can see the output.

34

00:02:24.540  -->  00:02:30.330
Now we'll explain what cells are what this toolbar is and how it all works in next lectures that are

35

00:02:30.330  -->  00:02:36.870
coming up but just so you know you can go to try that Jupiter or and try this all in your browser without

36

00:02:36.870  -->  00:02:38.600
having to download anything.

37

00:02:39.120  -->  00:02:41.150
Well let's actually focus on downloading.

38

00:02:41.340  -->  00:02:48.330
So we want to go to click here on install the notebook that will take you to the installation documentation

39

00:02:48.330  -->  00:02:50.670
for the Jupiter notebook system.

40

00:02:50.670  -->  00:02:52.440
You'll see there's three options.

41

00:02:52.450  -->  00:02:55.610
Installing Jupiter in Python installing Jupiter.

42

00:02:55.650  -->  00:03:02.520
If you already have Python or upgrading to a Jupiter installation here we'll focus on installing Jupiter

43

00:03:02.610  -->  00:03:06.120
and Python for New Years new users.

44

00:03:06.120  -->  00:03:12.660
It's highly recommended that you install Anaconda which conveniently installs Python the Jupiter notebook

45

00:03:12.750  -->  00:03:16.260
and other commonly used packages for scientific computing.

46

00:03:16.260  -->  00:03:18.460
I highly recommend you install Anaconda.

47

00:03:18.660  -->  00:03:23.200
Even if you already have some sort of version of Python on your computer system.

48

00:03:23.570  -->  00:03:28.580
So if you click this link it'll take you to this tab to continue on.

49

00:03:28.600  -->  00:03:31.890
I know slash downloads you can go here.

50

00:03:32.100  -->  00:03:40.230
Jump to Windows if you're using Windows and then go ahead and click the graphical installer Once you

51

00:03:40.230  -->  00:03:45.250
download the installer you just double click the executable file that's the dot e x.

52

00:03:45.280  -->  00:03:47.480
E file to install Anaconda.

53

00:03:47.520  -->  00:03:51.590
And just follow the instructions on the screen.

54

00:03:53.550  -->  00:03:58.570
So that's what I recommend for any user who doesn't have Anaconda's yet.

55

00:03:58.980  -->  00:04:06.060
If you already have Python and don't want to install the entire Anaconda distribution you can just install

56

00:04:06.060  -->  00:04:07.160
Jupiter.

57

00:04:07.500  -->  00:04:11.390
Depending on what installation packaging manager you have.

58

00:04:11.480  -->  00:04:18.000
If you already have anaconda you would just use conda installed Jupiter as a command line either in

59

00:04:18.000  -->  00:04:21.380
your command prompt or a terminal or a power shell.

60

00:04:21.480  -->  00:04:23.710
So I'll show you an example of that.

61

00:04:23.880  -->  00:04:31.610
So I go ahead and type in power shell into my search and click power shell.

62

00:04:31.830  -->  00:04:33.180
I'll get this command prompt.

63

00:04:33.190  -->  00:04:43.830
Terminal available to me and then I can just type Khanda install Jupiter enter and if you already have

64

00:04:43.830  -->  00:04:49.110
the Anaconda distribution this will install the Jupiter notebook's system.

65

00:04:49.110  -->  00:04:55.800
If you're using a different package manager such as Pip Pip 3 you can just say Pip install Jupiter or

66

00:04:55.800  -->  00:05:02.910
Pip 3 installed Jupiter and you'll see here it'll start fetching the package better data solving the

67

00:05:02.910  -->  00:05:10.150
packet specifications and eventually download everything for you all at that continue.

68

00:05:10.230  -->  00:05:13.980
You should note that some of Jupiter's dependencies may require compilation.

69

00:05:13.980  -->  00:05:16.140
In this case we will have to worry about that.

70

00:05:16.140  -->  00:05:18.750
We're just going to be using basic Python.

71

00:05:18.750  -->  00:05:22.520
You can also upgrade a Jupiter installation if your idea of Pip.

72

00:05:22.590  -->  00:05:27.400
Just use this Pip install Dasch you Jupiter freezing Anaconda.

73

00:05:27.420  -->  00:05:31.740
Just use Khanda space update space Jupiter.

74

00:05:31.740  -->  00:05:33.350
That's really all there is to it.

75

00:05:33.660  -->  00:05:35.880
So again just an overview.

76

00:05:36.300  -->  00:05:39.460
Go to try that Jupiter.

77

00:05:39.590  -->  00:05:47.280
Or if you want to just use everything in browser otherwise Google search Jupiter and then click on the

78

00:05:47.280  -->  00:05:52.920
link that will take you to the installation page and follow the directions that best suit you.

79

00:05:52.950  -->  00:05:57.550
I highly recommend installing Anaconda which will take you to this page.

80

00:05:57.600  -->  00:05:59.190
Click on the graphical installer.

81

00:05:59.250  -->  00:06:02.420
Follow the instructions and continue from there.

82

00:06:02.460  -->  00:06:08.830
Once you've installed everything you can just go to your Power Shell or command prompt for Windows.

83

00:06:08.880  -->  00:06:10.130
Either one is fine.

84

00:06:10.650  -->  00:06:14.970
And then type in Jupiter or notebook and you should get your own instance running.

85

00:06:15.630  -->  00:06:18.140
OK so that's it.

86

00:06:18.150  -->  00:06:21.310
Go ahead and check out the other documentation here.

87

00:06:21.330  -->  00:06:24.770
As far as running the notebook migrating from my Python etc..

88

00:06:25.080  -->  00:06:30.750
But once you've installed everything all you have to do is go to your command proper terminal type Jupiter

89

00:06:30.780  -->  00:06:34.240
notebook and you should see your own local instance of the Jupiter notebook.

90

00:06:34.240  -->  00:06:37.500
Running will go over old and a lot more detail.

91

00:06:37.500  -->  00:06:41.720
The Jupiter notebooks and the coarse notebooks in the future lectures.

92

00:06:41.790  -->  00:06:44.760
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
