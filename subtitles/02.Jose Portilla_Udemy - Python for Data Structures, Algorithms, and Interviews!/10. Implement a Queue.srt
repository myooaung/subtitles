Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview problem.

2

00:00:05,010  -->  00:00:10,900
So for this interview a task you've been asked to implement a Q It's a pretty common interview problem

3

00:00:10,900  -->  00:00:11,040
.

4

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:14,120
Just like implementing a stack or implementing a deck.

5

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:20,490
So in this case implement a queue class a class be able to do the following check if the queue is empty

6

00:00:20,490  -->  00:00:21,230
.

7

00:00:21,300  -->  00:00:27,780
Do it on cue or in queue do a queue and then return the size of the queue.

8

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:29,810
We review the theory lecture.

9

00:00:29,910  -->  00:00:32,280
If you don't remember what these two terms mean.

10

00:00:32,490  -->  00:00:37,440
But don't take a look at the implementation of a q lecture until you've tried doing this on your own

11

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:38,830
from memory.

12

00:00:38,890  -->  00:00:42,580
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
