Hello everyone and welcome to.

2

00:00:03.030  -->  00:00:07.920
Question 3 solution for the large search engine company mock interview.

3

00:00:07.920  -->  00:00:09.780
This question was given a string.

4

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:13.180
Write a function that uses recursion to reverse it.

5

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:15.870
So hopefully you remember this problem.

6

00:00:15.870  -->  00:00:19.620
You've already seen it in the recursion section of the course but let's go ahead.

7

00:00:19.620  -->  00:00:21.170
Using Python slicing.

8

00:00:21.300  -->  00:00:25.860
So we're not going to code anything out since you're having to use recursion here.

9

00:00:25.860  -->  00:00:28.460
You should always be thinking what's my base case.

10

00:00:28.560  -->  00:00:36.060
So in this case we're saying if the length of the string is less than or equal to 1 just return that

11

00:00:36.060  -->  00:00:42.120
string which makes sense that your base case when you've only had the last element or letter that string

12

00:00:42.120  -->  00:00:51.240
left as far as the recursive case you're going to return the call on everything of that string from

13

00:00:51.240  -->  00:00:56.040
index one forward plus the first element of that string.

14

00:00:56.040  -->  00:00:58.060
So notice how we're reversing it here.

15

00:00:58.170  -->  00:01:03.780
You're popping off that first one and then reversing everything else and then as you continue doing

16

00:01:03.780  -->  00:01:06.410
this you recursively reversing the string.

17

00:01:06.870  -->  00:01:12.120
So go ahead and review this problem go back to the recursion section in case you need to review anything

18

00:01:12.140  -->  00:01:12.310
.

19

00:01:12.540  -->  00:01:14.330
But that's really all there is this question.

20

00:01:14.520  -->  00:01:20.310
Make sure you always remember about base cases when someone says you need to do something recursively

21

00:01:20.310  -->  00:01:21.320
.

22

00:01:21.320  -->  00:01:23.100
All right that's about it for this.

23

00:01:23.130  -->  00:01:24.560
I'll see that the next solution.

24

00:01:24.570  -->  00:01:24.990
Thanks
