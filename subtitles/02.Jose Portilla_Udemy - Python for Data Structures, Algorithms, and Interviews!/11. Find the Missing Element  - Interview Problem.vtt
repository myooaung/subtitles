Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview problem.

2

00:00:04.000  -->  00:00:07.150
This one is called find the missing elements.

3

00:00:07.260  -->  00:00:09.480
So here's the problem statement.

4

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:13.110
Consider an array of non-negative integers.

5

00:00:13.710  -->  00:00:19.260
A second Turei is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and then deleting random elements

6

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:19.960
.

7

00:00:20.010  -->  00:00:24.990
Given these two arrays find which element is missing in the second array.

8

00:00:25.050  -->  00:00:31.200
So here's an example and put the first array shuffle and the number 5 is removed to construct the second

9

00:00:31.200  -->  00:00:32.070
array.

10

00:00:32.220  -->  00:00:39.680
So you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and then on the second array we have 3 7 2 1 4 6.

11

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:45.420
So your function which will call find here should be able to take in both arguments and then find the

12

00:00:45.420  -->  00:00:47.150
missing number.

13

00:00:47.190  -->  00:00:49.060
Go ahead and fill out your solution below.

14

00:00:49.110  -->  00:00:53.970
Here in Finder and then you can test your solution by running the cell.

15

00:00:53.970  -->  00:00:57.420
Here are some examples of what should output.

16

00:00:57.420  -->  00:01:01.620
All right that's it and I'll see you at the next lecture.

17

00:01:01.620  -->  00:01:02.550
Thanks everyone.
