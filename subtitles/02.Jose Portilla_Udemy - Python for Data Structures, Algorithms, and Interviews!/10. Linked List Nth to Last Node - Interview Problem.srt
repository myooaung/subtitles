00:00:01,230  -->  00:00:04,460
Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview problem.

2

00:00:04,550  -->  00:00:08,220
This was called linked list and to the last node.

3

00:00:08,460  -->  00:00:10,330
Here's the problem statement.

4

00:00:10,410  -->  00:00:16,470
Write a function that takes a head node and an integer value and and then returns the answer to last

5

00:00:16,470  -->  00:00:18,240
node in the linked list.

6

00:00:18,270  -->  00:00:27,570
For example given class Node with value and next node attributes your example input output looks something

7

00:00:27,570  -->  00:00:28,800
like this.

8

00:00:28,860  -->  00:00:36,010
If we set up a linked list called A B C D E with no values 1 2 3 4 5 and then set up the order.

9

00:00:36,030  -->  00:00:38,900
A B C D E.

10

00:00:40,200  -->  00:00:43,050
Then quickly checking what the solution should look like.

11

00:00:43,160  -->  00:00:49,950
As far as the format your function will take in n that end to last node number and then the head node

12

00:00:49,960  -->  00:00:50,660
.

13

00:00:51,360  -->  00:01:00,170
So here if we passen given this singly linked list format it as such passen to the head node A.

14

00:01:00,440  -->  00:01:05,900
This should return the no deagle value of 4 because it's the second to last node.

15

00:01:06,240  -->  00:01:11,520
So if you have a b c d e the second to last node is then D.

16

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:13,550
And that has a value of 4.

17

00:01:13,590  -->  00:01:18,750
So if we go out and check the target node value it returns 4 for us.

18

00:01:18,760  -->  00:01:21,930
First testing your solution you can go ahead and run this test cell.

19

00:01:21,960  -->  00:01:24,030
They'll test your solution to get a test case.

20

00:01:24,150  -->  00:01:26,400
Just note there there's just one test case.

21

00:01:26,490  -->  00:01:28,050
So go ahead and check it manually.

22

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:33,160
As you might to make sure your function is actually working as you think it should.

23

00:01:33,270  -->  00:01:34,100
OK.

24

00:01:34,140  -->  00:01:39,700
Again your problem statement is just write a function that takes in a head node an integer value and

25

00:01:40,090  -->  00:01:44,410
and then returns the nth to last node in the linked list.

26

00:01:44,570  -->  00:01:47,130
And here's an example of what it should look like.

27

00:01:47,130  -->  00:01:50,220
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
