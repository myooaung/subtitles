00:00:01.830  -->  00:00:06.880
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on organizing your job search.

2

00:00:06.930  -->  00:00:11.940
So we're going to discuss various tools for organizing your job search and we're also going to discuss

3

00:00:11.940  -->  00:00:14.190
job funnels.

4

00:00:14.190  -->  00:00:19.010
So first off staying organized is a fundamental part of a good job search.

5

00:00:19.230  -->  00:00:21.630
There's lots of tools out there available free to use.

6

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:24.430
So I want to give you some options to choose from.

7

00:00:24.480  -->  00:00:29.970
First off just general spreadsheets attached in the resource portion of this lecture is this PowerPoint

8

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:32.860
presentation and an Excel template for you.

9

00:00:32.880  -->  00:00:37.380
There's also a Google spreadsheet version and you can check out the resource links or go to this link

10

00:00:37.380  -->  00:00:37.850
right here.

11

00:00:37.860  -->  00:00:43.140
After downloading this PowerPoint so is going to take a quick tour of the spreadsheet provided for you

12

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:45.030
.

13

00:00:45.030  -->  00:00:45.550
All right.

14

00:00:45.690  -->  00:00:50.610
Here we are at the Google spreadsheet version of the Excel and the Google spreadsheet version are the

15

00:00:50.610  -->  00:00:51.650
same thing.

16

00:00:51.660  -->  00:00:53.510
So we're going to go over one of them here.

17

00:00:53.640  -->  00:00:55.820
First tab is your job search long.

18

00:00:55.920  -->  00:01:00.180
So here I'm actually very zoomed in so you can see that basically you're going to put in the job you

19

00:01:00.180  -->  00:01:03.480
applied for the position title company name.

20

00:01:03.600  -->  00:01:08.550
And if you have a contact maybe you contact that a recruiter or through networking you've got to contact

21

00:01:08.760  -->  00:01:10.710
that name here.

22

00:01:10.800  -->  00:01:16.180
Then there's a phone number fax e-mail address mailing address Web site.

23

00:01:16.350  -->  00:01:21.570
But more importantly here's which really want to fill out date resumes submitted how you submit your

24

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:27.960
resume when you get to that portion if you send references or not how you heard about the job and a

25

00:01:27.960  -->  00:01:31.740
job description for you to remember what the actual job's about.

26

00:01:31.950  -->  00:01:33.180
Comments as well.

27

00:01:33.180  -->  00:01:36.570
And then the status of the application.

28

00:01:36.660  -->  00:01:40.240
There's also a tab for networking contacts.

29

00:01:40.260  -->  00:01:43.990
So after you go to a networking event this might be a good thing to fill out.

30

00:01:43.980  -->  00:01:50.190
Truly similar but basically just holding contact information that they contacted and then comments and

31

00:01:50.190  -->  00:01:52.500
lead titles.

32

00:01:52.920  -->  00:01:55.830
After that there's the interviews tab.

33

00:01:55.830  -->  00:02:00.750
So once you actually book an interview you can say your interview date your interview name and whether

34

00:02:00.750  -->  00:02:04.790
or not you sent thank yous and comments on how the interview went.

35

00:02:05.160  -->  00:02:07.450
And then the last tab is just career Web sites.

36

00:02:07.470  -->  00:02:13.120
If you've checked the Web site you username your password on the Web site you posted your resume.

37

00:02:13.140  -->  00:02:16.320
They posted your cover letter and then comments for yourself.

38

00:02:16.320  -->  00:02:18.680
So you should really really use this log.

39

00:02:18.690  -->  00:02:25.220
I highly recommend that you have to use some sort of organization when you're searching for jobs.

40

00:02:25.590  -->  00:02:31.780
So this Google spreadsheet template is provided and so is an Excel template of the same format.

41

00:02:32.100  -->  00:02:36.060
So check out the resources in this lecture for links to those.

42

00:02:36.290  -->  00:02:39.380
Let's go ahead and go back to the presentation.

43

00:02:39.390  -->  00:02:39.700
All right.

44

00:02:39.720  -->  00:02:41.290
So he took a tour of the spreadsheet.

45

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:45.240
One of the resource I want you to be aware of are some Web sites.

46

00:02:45.420  -->  00:02:50.370
So there's a couple of Web sites that help you track your job progress or your job search progress.

47

00:02:50.370  -->  00:02:52.820
That is one of them's not a job hero.

48

00:02:52.830  -->  00:02:53.540
You can check it out.

49

00:02:53.560  -->  00:02:56.290
A Go job here dot com.

50

00:02:56.340  -->  00:02:59.170
Let's go ahead and take a look at it in our browser.

51

00:02:59.880  -->  00:03:02.340
So this is what job here looks like.

52

00:03:02.340  -->  00:03:04.550
Again these Web sites tend to come and go.

53

00:03:04.710  -->  00:03:10.050
So make sure you check the resources in the picture in case job hero ever goes down or is out of business

54

00:03:10.050  -->  00:03:10.070
.

55

00:03:10.080  -->  00:03:14.180
We'll have the most up to date information in the resource section of this lecture.

56

00:03:14.250  -->  00:03:16.830
But for now you might want to check a job here.

57

00:03:16.890  -->  00:03:22.780
Basically a dashboard that will save jobs from across the web and track your application process.

58

00:03:22.920  -->  00:03:29.190
It tracks from web sites that says indeed glass Glassdoor dice Linked-In stack overflow and more.

59

00:03:29.340  -->  00:03:30.880
So you might want to check it out.

60

00:03:30.960  -->  00:03:37.170
Or again you can use a spreadsheet or whatever you prefer heading back to the presentation.

61

00:03:37.170  -->  00:03:39.840
Let's now go ahead and discuss job funnels.

62

00:03:39.840  -->  00:03:45.000
So you might be wondering why is it so important to track every aspect of my job search when I just

63

00:03:45.000  -->  00:03:49.730
remember well most likely you're going to be applying for about 100 jobs.

64

00:03:49.950  -->  00:03:55.560
That depends on where you live job availability or your experience etc. but most likely will be a number

65

00:03:55.560  -->  00:03:56.610
in that range.

66

00:03:56.610  -->  00:04:02.340
You have to really apply for a ton of jobs because there's a funnel to this job hunting can be extremely

67

00:04:02.340  -->  00:04:02.980
competitive.

68

00:04:03.000  -->  00:04:08.160
So make sure not to focus exclusively on well-known companies because there's plenty of great opportunities

69

00:04:08.220  -->  00:04:13.950
at companies you haven't heard of yet as far as what your job funnel may look like you're probably going

70

00:04:13.950  -->  00:04:21.120
to apply to somewhere between 100 and 150 straight up applications either through networking or people

71

00:04:21.120  -->  00:04:26.520
you have through LinkedIn or even just on the job web site itself.

72

00:04:26.520  -->  00:04:32.850
So the company web site then you can expect about 20 to 30 responses somewhere in that range depending

73

00:04:32.850  -->  00:04:35.250
on your experience and your resume.

74

00:04:35.340  -->  00:04:39.240
After that you'll probably get passed to about 10 to 15 phone screens.

75

00:04:39.240  -->  00:04:46.200
Then about five to 10 onsite interviews and if the company happens to second stage onsite interviews

76

00:04:46.290  -->  00:04:52.860
around 2 to 5 and after that you'll probably expect to have once a three offers compared to now again

77

00:04:52.980  -->  00:04:57.410
this can really vary depending on who you are or what school you went to.

78

00:04:57.600  -->  00:05:02.820
If it's a popular school for recruiters you may get way more offers and way more on site interviews

79

00:05:03.330  -->  00:05:09.720
or if you have a lot more experience you may get better access for interviews so this could really vary

80

00:05:09.720  -->  00:05:11.390
the pending on who you are.

81

00:05:11.400  -->  00:05:12.720
So just keep that in mind.

82

00:05:13.020  -->  00:05:18.860
But most likely you'll have to do more applications than you think you're going to have to do.

83

00:05:19.050  -->  00:05:21.620
So on that note make sure to not get discouraged.

84

00:05:21.630  -->  00:05:27.960
You're already on the right path by taking this course so that all being said go ahead and check out

85

00:05:27.960  -->  00:05:33.000
the resources for this lecture to get all the links and all the templates and I'll see at the next lecture

86

00:05:33.000  -->  00:05:33.510
.

87

00:05:33.510  -->  00:05:34.830
Thanks everyone.
