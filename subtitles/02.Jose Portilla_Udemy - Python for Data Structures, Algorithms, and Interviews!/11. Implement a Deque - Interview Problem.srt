Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview.

2

00:00:03,570  -->  00:00:05,280
Problem for the stacks.

3

00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:07,990
Q Is index section of the Course.

4

00:00:08,550  -->  00:00:14,100
This interview problem is to simply implement a deck class your tech class should be able to do the

5

00:00:14,100  -->  00:00:16,950
following check if it's empty.

6

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:19,510
Add to both the front and the rear of the deck.

7

00:00:19,710  -->  00:00:24,970
Remove from the front and the rear of the deck and check the size of the deck.

8

00:00:25,000  -->  00:00:32,130
OK with that being said there is no solution inch lecture associated with this particular problem because

9

00:00:32,130  -->  00:00:34,950
we already have an implementation of DEC lecture.

10

00:00:35,010  -->  00:00:40,200
So after trying this out on your own you can go ahead and review the implementation of a DEC notebook

11

00:00:40,200  -->  00:00:43,670
and lecture to get your solution to this problem.

12

00:00:43,680  -->  00:00:48,450
With that being said Make sure you try out this your own solution beforehand.

13

00:00:48,450  -->  00:00:53,190
Don't take a peek at the solution before trying it on your own from memory.

14

00:00:53,210  -->  00:00:56,400
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
