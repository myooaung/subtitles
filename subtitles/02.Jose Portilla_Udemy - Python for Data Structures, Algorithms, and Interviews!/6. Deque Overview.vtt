Hello everyone and welcome to the deck overview lecture.

2

00:00:04.920  -->  00:00:10.890
So we've done overviews on stacks and Qs and we've also done our own implementations of stack and queue

3

00:00:10.890  -->  00:00:19.740
classes so Nelse learn about DEC linear data structure a deck also known as a double and that Q is an

4

00:00:19.740  -->  00:00:22.500
ordered collection of items similar to the cube.

5

00:00:22.740  -->  00:00:28.710
It has two ends of front and rear and the items remain position in the collection.

6

00:00:28.710  -->  00:00:34.680
What makes a deck different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items new items can be

7

00:00:34.680  -->  00:00:37.230
added to either the front or the rear.

8

00:00:37.230  -->  00:00:41.210
So that's a huge difference between a deck and a curious deck.

9

00:00:41.310  -->  00:00:45.040
We can add items in it to the front or the rear of the deck.

10

00:00:45.360  -->  00:00:48.920
Likewise existing items can be removed from either end.

11

00:00:49.500  -->  00:00:55.110
So in a sense this hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single

12

00:00:55.110  -->  00:00:57.050
data structure.

13

00:00:57.060  -->  00:01:01.050
It's important to know that even though the deck can assume many of the characteristics of stacks and

14

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:07.800
queues it does not require the last in first out and first in first out orderings that are enforced

15

00:01:07.800  -->  00:01:09.440
by those data structures.

16

00:01:09.480  -->  00:01:14.950
So it's completely up to you to make consistent use of the addition and removal operations.

17

00:01:15.640  -->  00:01:16.030
OK.

18

00:01:16.080  -->  00:01:18.690
So let's go ahead and see a diagram of this.

19

00:01:18.720  -->  00:01:22.570
So here's just a really simple diagram of what a deck looks like.

20

00:01:22.590  -->  00:01:28.590
You'll notice it looks similar to AQ but in this case we can add and remove items from either ends either

21

00:01:28.590  -->  00:01:30.370
the front or the back.

22

00:01:30.390  -->  00:01:32.620
So that's a pretty big difference.

23

00:01:32.640  -->  00:01:37.530
So let's learn how to implement a deck in the next lecture.

24

00:01:37.530  -->  00:01:38.260
OK.

25

00:01:38.550  -->  00:01:39.960
So I'll see you with the next lecture.

26

00:01:39.960  -->  00:01:42.820
Remember that a deck that's just a review.

27

00:01:43.050  -->  00:01:48.080
The main difference is that you can add items from either end and remove items from either end.

28

00:01:48.480  -->  00:01:50.810
So let's go see how we can implement that.

29

00:01:50.820  -->  00:01:52.500
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
