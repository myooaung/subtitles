Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on company matching sites.

2

00:00:05.060  -->  00:00:08.330
In this lecture we're going to learn what a company's matching site is.

3

00:00:08.490  -->  00:00:13.260
We're going to look at various company matching sites and you could check out the next lecture for continuously

4

00:00:13.290  -->  00:00:14.930
updated list of links.

5

00:00:14.940  -->  00:00:18.700
So don't worry about marking down the Web sites we're going to check out in the next lecture.

6

00:00:18.700  -->  00:00:21.950
There's a list of all the links you can check out yourself.

7

00:00:22.110  -->  00:00:23.460
So it is good and jumped the browser.

8

00:00:23.460  -->  00:00:30.170
Check out the sites and get an explanation of what we mean by company matching sites.

9

00:00:30.180  -->  00:00:30.630
OK.

10

00:00:30.720  -->  00:00:34.480
So the first site we're going to talk about and give you the premise for what a company matching site

11

00:00:34.500  -->  00:00:36.970
is is hired dot com.

12

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:38.770
H i r e d.

13

00:00:38.910  -->  00:00:40.140
Hired.

14

00:00:40.140  -->  00:00:45.160
So that's one of the most famous of these sort of company matching sites and what you basically do this

15

00:00:45.230  -->  00:00:49.560
is the premise for all of these type of sites is you fill out a profile.

16

00:00:49.560  -->  00:00:50.910
Answer some questions.

17

00:00:51.000  -->  00:00:56.070
And if you're applying for a technical position such as a programmer or developer you'll get some sort

18

00:00:56.070  -->  00:01:00.490
of technical challenge at times on some sort of web site or browser interface.

19

00:01:00.750  -->  00:01:06.960
You do the challenge and if you pass the challenge then you get matched employers looking to hire candidates

20

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:10.580
hired in particular you answer a few questions.

21

00:01:10.620  -->  00:01:15.090
Do their challenge if you're applying for a technical position and then a company companies send you

22

00:01:15.090  -->  00:01:19.400
offers and they give you the compensation they would provide you with upfront.

23

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:24.740
So you know right away whether the interview process is worth going over again.

24

00:01:24.780  -->  00:01:26.760
These are really interview offers.

25

00:01:26.760  -->  00:01:28.680
They don't give you a straight up job offers.

26

00:01:28.710  -->  00:01:30.770
You still have to interview with the company.

27

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:37.890
But if you're lucky enough to get a job they're hired you'll get a $2000 bonus from hired a really similar

28

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:39.920
Web site is a white truffle.

29

00:01:39.930  -->  00:01:46.350
Again one application one profile you pass some sort of coding challenge a get matched with a couple

30

00:01:46.350  -->  00:01:48.420
of thousand companies.

31

00:01:49.320  -->  00:01:49.750
OK.

32

00:01:49.800  -->  00:01:53.550
Next site we're going to talk about is indeed prime so indeed prime.

33

00:01:53.550  -->  00:01:55.440
Same thing as white truffle and hired.

34

00:01:55.440  -->  00:01:59.200
I know we talked about in the dot.com which was a basic job search tool.

35

00:01:59.340  -->  00:02:03.270
Indeed Pryme you fill out a profile pass a technical challenge.

36

00:02:03.660  -->  00:02:09.180
And if you get matched for company and take the offer you get a $5000 signing bonus.

37

00:02:09.240  -->  00:02:15.840
Indeed if you're interested in working at a startup you can check out under-dog that IPO which is the

38

00:02:15.840  -->  00:02:20.430
same thing as the other sites except it's focused on startups.

39

00:02:20.640  -->  00:02:26.800
If you're wanting to work at a Y C start up so y Combinator is an incubator for startups.

40

00:02:27.060  -->  00:02:31.800
Probably the most famous one in existence if you're interested in NYC startups in general.

41

00:02:31.800  -->  00:02:36.420
You can go to triple bite dot com that's T R I L E.

42

00:02:36.600  -->  00:02:38.590
Byte b y t e.

43

00:02:38.880  -->  00:02:47.130
And it will connect you after applying and pasand their technical interview with Y C startups and then

44

00:02:47.130  -->  00:02:53.400
finally there's anthology that used to be called coachable but it's the same thing you create a profile

45

00:02:53.550  -->  00:02:58.080
and you get better job matches using what they call confidential data.

46

00:02:58.140  -->  00:03:00.660
So private employer data.

47

00:03:00.840  -->  00:03:02.940
All right go ahead and go to the next lecture.

48

00:03:02.970  -->  00:03:04.150
Check out the links.

49

00:03:04.200  -->  00:03:10.890
Again you should really study your stuff and no coding problems well before you check out these sites

50

00:03:10.890  -->  00:03:11.970
.

51

00:03:11.970  -->  00:03:14.690
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
