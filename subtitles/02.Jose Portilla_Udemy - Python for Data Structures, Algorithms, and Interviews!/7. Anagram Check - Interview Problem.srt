Hello everyone and welcome to your first interview problem per the array sequences section of the Course

2

00:00:05,850  -->  00:00:06,480
.

3

00:00:06,530  -->  00:00:12,420
This problem is called anagram check problem statement is this Given two strings.

4

00:00:12,450  -->  00:00:14,450
Check to see if there are anagrams.

5

00:00:14,490  -->  00:00:20,130
So as a reminder an anagram is when two strings can be written using the exact same letters so you can

6

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:23,110
just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word.

7

00:00:23,160  -->  00:00:32,730
So for example the string public relations is an anagram of crap built on lies and the string Clint

8

00:00:32,820  -->  00:00:36,750
Eastwood is an anagram of Old West action.

9

00:00:36,750  -->  00:00:44,130
So just a quick note for this problem you can ignore spaces and capitalizations so the space G-0 can

10

00:00:44,130  -->  00:00:50,550
be an anagram of God and dog and O space D space G.

11

00:00:50,640  -->  00:00:54,190
So again you're given two strings a check to see if the anagrams.

12

00:00:54,480  -->  00:00:57,170
So fill out your solution below and this function.

13

00:00:57,320  -->  00:01:00,020
And here we can see anagram of dog god Clint Eastwood.

14

00:01:00,040  -->  00:01:01,100
Oldest action.

15

00:01:01,160  -->  00:01:03,050
A B B and.

16

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:05,070
True true false to booleans.

17

00:01:05,460  -->  00:01:06,790
You can run this cell right here.

18

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:11,310
To test your solution below and see if you can pass the test cases.

19

00:01:11,310  -->  00:01:11,900
All right.

20

00:01:12,060  -->  00:01:13,150
But that being said.

21

00:01:13,170  -->  00:01:16,530
Best of luck in the next lecture will go over the solution.

22

00:01:16,530  -->  00:01:17,120
Thanks everyone
