Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview problem.

2

00:00:03,910  -->  00:00:06,120
Is called string compression.

3

00:00:06,120  -->  00:00:11,920
So here's the problem statement given a string in the form such as this.

4

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:16,330
So multiple letters compress it so that it becomes in this form.

5

00:00:16,470  -->  00:00:20,350
So you have the letter and then the count of how many times that occur.

6

00:00:20,610  -->  00:00:25,850
Put this problem you can falsely compress strings of single or double letters.

7

00:00:25,920  -->  00:00:36,370
So for instance it's OK for a B to return a to b 1 even though there's technically more space.

8

00:00:36,570  -->  00:00:42,410
So the function should also be case sensitive so that the string aka a lowercase a.

9

00:00:42,460  -->  00:00:46,260
Returns capital a theory and lowercase a theory.

10

00:00:47,130  -->  00:00:53,040
So fill out your solution below and then run this test cell to test your solution.

11

00:00:53,520  -->  00:00:56,520
Ok that's it for the string compression again.

12

00:00:56,580  -->  00:00:59,730
It's OK to do false compression such as this.

13

00:00:59,730  -->  00:01:01,650
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
