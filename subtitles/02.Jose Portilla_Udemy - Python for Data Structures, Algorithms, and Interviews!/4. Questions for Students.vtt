Hello everyone and welcome on the lecture for questions for students.

2

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:11.760
So for the lecture after here the question posited here an attempt an answer afterwards we're going

3

00:00:11.760  -->  00:00:14.600
to go over some general advice for the question.

4

00:00:15.120  -->  00:00:19.020
So first question is why did you choose this profession.

5

00:00:19.020  -->  00:00:20.710
Slash your major.

6

00:00:20.710  -->  00:00:24.860
It's a puzzle video now in answer the question.

7

00:00:26.260  -->  00:00:26.930
OK.

8

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:32.490
So be honest about how you chose your major or profession unless you fell into it.

9

00:00:32.490  -->  00:00:37.350
In that case you should be honest anyways but show that you have an abundance of enthusiasm about being

10

00:00:37.350  -->  00:00:41.210
part of the field and you're highly motivated to succeed in it.

11

00:00:41.280  -->  00:00:41.720
All right.

12

00:00:41.880  -->  00:00:49.170
Next question What subjects did you enjoy the most and which did you enjoy the least puzzle video now

13

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:49.530
.

14

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:53.490
Answer the question.

15

00:00:53.490  -->  00:00:54.360
All right.

16

00:00:54.360  -->  00:00:57.600
This is a question that may define your strengths and weaknesses.

17

00:00:57.720  -->  00:00:59.910
So use caution when you respond.

18

00:00:59.910  -->  00:01:05.310
Be sure to align your subjects that you liked with the position and what it requires for the ones you

19

00:01:05.310  -->  00:01:06.500
like the least.

20

00:01:06.600  -->  00:01:09.930
Choose the ones that have no bearing on your future of the company.

21

00:01:09.930  -->  00:01:14.820
So for instance if you're interviewing for a software development position it doesn't look so bad if

22

00:01:14.820  -->  00:01:18.470
you disliked art history the most.

23

00:01:18.540  -->  00:01:24.350
Just keep in mind if your interviewer has expressed any interest in specific courses or subjects.

24

00:01:24.350  -->  00:01:28.920
Keep those in mind when you're answering the questions and don't talk down any particular subject.

25

00:01:28.920  -->  00:01:30.680
Just say it wasn't for you.

26

00:01:30.690  -->  00:01:34.770
Next question is What's your greatest achievement in school.

27

00:01:34.770  -->  00:01:39.900
Pause the video now and answer the question.

28

00:01:39.900  -->  00:01:40.460
All right.

29

00:01:40.620  -->  00:01:43.080
This is an opportunity for you to show off with confidence.

30

00:01:43.110  -->  00:01:45.960
So anthracis the things you want to highlight overall.

31

00:01:46.140  -->  00:01:48.450
Just go for it and don't hold back.

32

00:01:48.750  -->  00:01:53.760
And that's it for answering this question obviously will be personalized for you and what your greatest

33

00:01:53.760  -->  00:01:57.260
achievement you felt was in school.

34

00:01:57.300  -->  00:01:58.420
That's it for this section.

35

00:01:58.440  -->  00:01:59.580
So good job.

36

00:01:59.580  -->  00:02:02.570
Up next we'll discuss some special case questions.

37

00:02:02.580  -->  00:02:04.450
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
