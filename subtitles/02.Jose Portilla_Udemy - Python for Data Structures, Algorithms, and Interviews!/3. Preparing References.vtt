00:00:01.250  -->  00:00:07.980
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture I'm preparing references so references are the final stage

2

00:00:07.980  -->  00:00:12.180
of the interview process before you actually begin to receive a formal offer.

3

00:00:12.210  -->  00:00:16.110
So let's go ahead and go over some general tips.

4

00:00:16.110  -->  00:00:20.850
First off you should identify three to five people to be potential references.

5

00:00:20.850  -->  00:00:26.400
Usually a formal job application requires about three and you should always contact your reference at

6

00:00:26.400  -->  00:00:28.400
the beginning of your job search.

7

00:00:28.500  -->  00:00:31.230
Make sure to get their e-mail and phone number.

8

00:00:31.230  -->  00:00:35.290
Then you should call your references letting them know they should expect to be contacted.

9

00:00:35.460  -->  00:00:40.740
Once you know that the recruiter at the company you've been interviewing with is going to contact your

10

00:00:40.740  -->  00:00:42.040
references.

11

00:00:42.960  -->  00:00:46.000
So who to ask for a reference.

12

00:00:46.000  -->  00:00:47.830
There's different types of people you can ask.

13

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:51.960
You can ask previous superiors and you should make sure that they're able to promote your value and

14

00:00:51.960  -->  00:00:56.910
ability to perform produce and contribute to organizational goals.

15

00:00:56.910  -->  00:00:59.720
There's also previous peers people you work with.

16

00:00:59.870  -->  00:01:04.470
They should be able to endorse your ability to work together as a team member and as a leader.

17

00:01:04.470  -->  00:01:09.800
This confirms your ability to put the organization agenda before your personal agenda.

18

00:01:10.640  -->  00:01:15.330
There's also subordinate's people that worked for you and they should be able to vouch for your training

19

00:01:15.330  -->  00:01:16.520
and coaching skills.

20

00:01:16.740  -->  00:01:19.330
Also promoting your supervision skills.

21

00:01:20.130  -->  00:01:22.060
And then there's clients and vendors.

22

00:01:22.170  -->  00:01:26.790
They should be able to affirm your high quality customer service and professional integrity.

23

00:01:27.390  -->  00:01:32.850
And finally Mixtura always ask people you know well and will speak well about you.

24

00:01:32.880  -->  00:01:35.330
All right that's it for preparing references.

25

00:01:35.370  -->  00:01:38.430
And that's it for the non-technical portion of this course.

26

00:01:38.430  -->  00:01:42.930
Up next we'll have a little technical break section where we get a quick overview on the format for

27

00:01:42.930  -->  00:01:44.490
the rest of the course.

28

00:01:44.490  -->  00:01:47.120
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
