00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:05,970
Well everyone welcome to the non technical questions lecture.

2

00:00:06,090  -->  00:00:11,670
So in the next lecture you'll see a list of questions and what I want you to do is practice answering

3

00:00:11,670  -->  00:00:13,940
these for your dream companies.

4

00:00:14,190  -->  00:00:19,140
And I also want you to record yourself answering these questions or answer these questions when you're

5

00:00:19,140  -->  00:00:21,190
in front of a family member friend.

6

00:00:21,330  -->  00:00:26,580
So you can really get a feel for what it's like to practice answering these questions in a real situation

7

00:00:26,580  -->  00:00:32,160
with someone else and recording yourself allows you to hear yourself and see how good of a job you're

8

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:33,240
doing.

9

00:00:33,240  -->  00:00:33,630
All right.

10

00:00:33,660  -->  00:00:34,680
That being said.

11

00:00:34,770  -->  00:00:35,190
Go ahead.

12

00:00:35,190  -->  00:00:36,740
There's a huge list of questions.

13

00:00:36,810  -->  00:00:40,200
So just pick out five for each of the mock interviews to answer.

14

00:00:40,520  -->  00:00:41,120
OK.

15

00:00:41,130  -->  00:00:41,760
Thanks everyone.

16

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:42,770
I'll see you at the next lecture
