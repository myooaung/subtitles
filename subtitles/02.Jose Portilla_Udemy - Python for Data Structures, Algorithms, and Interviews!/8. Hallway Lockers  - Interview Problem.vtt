Hello everyone and welcome to your next riddle.

2

00:00:03.560  -->  00:00:05.890
It's called hallway lockers.

3

00:00:06.060  -->  00:00:12.390
You're in a hallway lined with 100 lockers and you start on your first pass and open up all the lockers

4

00:00:13.410  -->  00:00:19.440
so that all the open lockers now have their doors open outwards so all 100 lockers are have been opened

5

00:00:19.440  -->  00:00:21.510
on their first pass.

6

00:00:21.510  -->  00:00:26.620
Then on your second pass you begin by closing every second locker.

7

00:00:27.120  -->  00:00:29.030
Then you make a third pass.

8

00:00:29.430  -->  00:00:31.840
And this is what you do on your third pass.

9

00:00:32.190  -->  00:00:35.710
You go on every third locker and you close it.

10

00:00:35.720  -->  00:00:42.360
If it's open or open it if it's close I will refer to this as toggling the lockers.

11

00:00:42.540  -->  00:00:47.390
Then you continue toggling every nth locker unpassed number n.

12

00:00:47.700  -->  00:00:54.160
So in your fourth pass you're going to go for every fourth blocker and then check if it's closed.

13

00:00:54.210  -->  00:00:57.140
Open it if it's open you'll close it.

14

00:00:57.180  -->  00:01:03.750
You'll toggle those lockers then on your fifth pass you'll go on every fifth locker and toggle those

15

00:01:04.770  -->  00:01:08.360
after you pass 100 times in the hallway.

16

00:01:08.490  -->  00:01:16.930
So your 100th pass and that includes your first pass free opened all the lockers in on your 100th pass

17

00:01:16.930  -->  00:01:16.950
.

18

00:01:16.950  -->  00:01:20.190
You're only going to toggle locker number 100.

19

00:01:20.190  -->  00:01:27.180
So the question is after that Hunter pass how many of the lockers remain open.

20

00:01:27.180  -->  00:01:27.830
All right.

21

00:01:28.170  -->  00:01:33.150
This is a pretty hard riddle to solve and it's really just a math puzzle.

22

00:01:33.150  -->  00:01:34.830
So keep that in mind.

23

00:01:34.920  -->  00:01:37.220
And best of luck and I'll see if the next lecture
