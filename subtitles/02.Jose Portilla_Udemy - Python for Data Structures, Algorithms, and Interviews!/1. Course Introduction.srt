00:00:00,870  -->  00:00:07,620
Welcome to Python for data structures algorithms interviews I'm Jose Portsea and I've taught thousands

2

00:00:07,620  -->  00:00:13,080
of students are new to me about Python programming and data science and now I've created a course to

3

00:00:13,080  -->  00:00:15,640
help students of the interview process.

4

00:00:15,750  -->  00:00:21,170
This course will help you ace the type of coding interviews done at the top technology companies.

5

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:23,650
So what do you get off this course.

6

00:00:23,650  -->  00:00:28,260
This is a three in one course it includes lectures on data structures and algorithms.

7

00:00:28,330  -->  00:00:35,280
It's a cover computer science theory plus coding questions asked in real interviews and answers to them

8

00:00:35,940  -->  00:00:41,790
as well as non-technical interview preparation such as Resume reviews and doing well and in person interviews

9

00:00:41,780  -->  00:00:42,590
.

10

00:00:42,720  -->  00:00:45,070
This course is packed with tons of content.

11

00:00:45,120  -->  00:00:51,060
You'll get lifetime access to over 200 lectures for every lecture consist of a video with clear explanation

12

00:00:51,060  -->  00:00:56,060
of a topic along with a notebook of written code and explanations for reference so you can learn in

13

00:00:56,060  -->  00:00:59,320
whatever way works best for you.

14

00:00:59,410  -->  00:01:03,240
We cover everything you need to know to interview overall.

15

00:01:03,660  -->  00:01:08,610
The course consists of non-technical interview preparation reviews of all major data structures and

16

00:01:08,640  -->  00:01:15,840
algorithms practice interview problems and mock tech company interviews.

17

00:01:15,930  -->  00:01:22,590
So who's this course for this course is designed for a variety of audiences including self-taught programmers

18

00:01:22,890  -->  00:01:27,750
who already know Python and want to learn about data structures and algorithms and begin interviewing

19

00:01:27,750  -->  00:01:32,710
for tech positions as well as students currently studying computer science.

20

00:01:32,820  -->  00:01:37,860
And want supplementary material and data structures and algorithms and interview preparation for after

21

00:01:37,860  -->  00:01:44,570
graduation as well as professional programmers who need practice for upcoming coding interviews.

22

00:01:44,760  -->  00:01:49,770
And finally anyone interested in learning more about data structures and algorithms or the technical

23

00:01:49,770  -->  00:01:54,050
interview process choose this course.

24

00:01:54,050  -->  00:01:56,940
Don't just get high quality videos and lecture materials.

25

00:01:56,940  -->  00:02:01,920
You also get a program designed to effectively teach you what you need to know efficiently as possible

26

00:02:01,920  -->  00:02:02,520
.

27

00:02:02,520  -->  00:02:07,350
It's like having private tutors design an interview study curriculum just for you.
