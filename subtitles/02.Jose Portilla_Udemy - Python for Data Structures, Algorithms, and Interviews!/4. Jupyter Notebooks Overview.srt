00:00:01,080  -->  00:00:05,650
Hello everyone and welcome to the Jupiter notebook's overview lecture.

2

00:00:05,760  -->  00:00:09,350
A quick note check the previous lectures for installation instructions.

3

00:00:09,360  -->  00:00:14,370
If you haven't installed Jupiter notebooks already on your system this lecture we're going to be looking

4

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:18,800
at an overview of the Jupiter books capabilities as the best way to use them.

5

00:00:18,810  -->  00:00:22,640
So let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebooks.

6

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:23,070
All right.

7

00:00:23,160  -->  00:00:28,680
So I started Jupiter notebooks by following the installation instructions we just typed Jupiter notebook

8

00:00:28,800  -->  00:00:33,600
either into your terminal or into power show or your command prompt depending what system you're using

9

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:33,980
.

10

00:00:34,260  -->  00:00:36,840
You should get something like this in your browser.

11

00:00:36,960  -->  00:00:39,870
I suggest using Chrome or Firefox.

12

00:00:39,870  -->  00:00:41,020
Go ahead and click on the right.

13

00:00:41,070  -->  00:00:46,170
You should see an option for creating notebooks either Python 2 or Python 3 depending on your installation

14

00:00:46,800  -->  00:00:48,330
and then you'll see something like this.

15

00:00:48,330  -->  00:00:53,940
So let's go ahead and go over what these buttons are and what this system's like.

16

00:00:53,940  -->  00:00:56,060
So first off we have our toolbar here.

17

00:00:56,400  -->  00:01:00,120
This is a save button which saves and creates a checkpoint for your notebook.

18

00:01:00,400  -->  00:01:04,620
This plus button will insert a new cell and will discuss what cells are in a second.

19

00:01:04,620  -->  00:01:05,670
So if you click it.

20

00:01:05,670  -->  00:01:12,520
Haven't you so you can cut copy and paste cells using these three buttons.

21

00:01:12,540  -->  00:01:16,980
This allows you to move up a select cell and then move down a slick cell.

22

00:01:17,010  -->  00:01:23,120
This is run stop and restart kernels which is basically just same as running a cell.

23

00:01:23,940  -->  00:01:31,410
And then you have another tool by here her file options and options viewing options inserting options

24

00:01:31,410  -->  00:01:35,470
for cells then running options kernel options.

25

00:01:35,520  -->  00:01:41,160
You're having trouble with a kernel being stuck in a loop and then you also have help.

26

00:01:41,250  -->  00:01:44,860
So there's keyboard shortcuts here in case you want to know more about shortcuts.

27

00:01:44,890  -->  00:01:50,270
There's also help for the various libraries used in scientific Python.

28

00:01:50,280  -->  00:01:50,880
All right.

29

00:01:51,000  -->  00:01:53,660
So let's go ahead and see how this works.

30

00:01:54,030  -->  00:02:00,470
So for python we can go ahead and just write code straight into the cell.

31

00:02:00,810  -->  00:02:07,950
So for instance one plus one and to run the cell I could either click run here and I will see a new

32

00:02:08,010  -->  00:02:17,160
output right below the cell or I can also do type in the code and by clicking shift and then enter that

33

00:02:17,160  -->  00:02:18,140
will run the cell.

34

00:02:18,300  -->  00:02:21,500
So it's not just enter it's shift and then enter.

35

00:02:21,600  -->  00:02:21,910
All right.

36

00:02:21,960  -->  00:02:24,440
So that's one key feature of the Jubran notebooks.

37

00:02:24,480  -->  00:02:28,910
Another one is hints and docstring completion.

38

00:02:28,920  -->  00:02:33,360
So what I mean by that is if I start to write a function in Python.

39

00:02:33,360  -->  00:02:43,170
So for instance SDR which converts things to strings I can click tab Erskine's me shift plus tab and

40

00:02:43,170  -->  00:02:48,560
it will bring up the document string so I'll return a nice string representation of the object.

41

00:02:49,170  -->  00:02:59,020
I can also call help on any function and I will get the entire docstring for that function.

42

00:02:59,130  -->  00:03:05,550
So you have a couple of options here again whatever function you have and I just cleared that by running

43

00:03:05,550  -->  00:03:08,200
an empty cell whatever function you have.

44

00:03:08,200  -->  00:03:09,950
So for instance let's do another function.

45

00:03:10,080  -->  00:03:19,140
Let's go ahead and import from the math library sunglass say from math in poor obscurity shift enter

46

00:03:19,130  -->  00:03:20,820
.

47

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:28,710
And now if I'm using a security and I'm not sure what to do with it I can do shift tab with my cursor

48

00:03:28,710  -->  00:03:29,990
right after that function.

49

00:03:30,030  -->  00:03:32,100
It will give me the document string.

50

00:03:32,100  -->  00:03:36,810
It'll give me the short version and if I want more I can click plus here and it will grow.

51

00:03:36,810  -->  00:03:41,630
This should give you more information if there is more information available there.

52

00:03:41,640  -->  00:03:47,970
So for instance if we want more information on list shift tab gets me the docstring if I want more information

53

00:03:48,600  -->  00:03:50,740
like this down I'll give you more information.

54

00:03:50,760  -->  00:03:53,310
There's more information available.

55

00:03:53,310  -->  00:03:53,850
All right.

56

00:03:54,240  -->  00:03:56,350
So what else can we do.

57

00:03:56,400  -->  00:03:59,070
We can also see methods and attributes of an object.

58

00:03:59,070  -->  00:04:06,020
So for instance by say as equals string let's say hello shift enter.

59

00:04:06,360  -->  00:04:08,860
Now S is going to be that string.

60

00:04:09,450  -->  00:04:13,920
So one thing to know is that these cells are not independent of each other.

61

00:04:13,980  -->  00:04:21,230
If I set a variable in one cell that variable can be run and any other cells such as here it's saved

62

00:04:21,250  -->  00:04:21,890
as Hello.

63

00:04:21,900  -->  00:04:23,440
So just keep that in mind.

64

00:04:23,940  -->  00:04:25,440
Again you can always check the order.

65

00:04:25,440  -->  00:04:27,660
You ran cells in by checking the numbers here.

66

00:04:27,660  -->  00:04:33,090
So 1 2 5 6 7 4 we ran over it so that we did three.

67

00:04:33,750  -->  00:04:40,350
But what's nice about Jupiter notebook and I Python in general is that if you click s dot.

68

00:04:40,350  -->  00:04:49,290
So let's say we wanted to do a certain method such as upper case all this letters are elements in that

69

00:04:49,290  -->  00:04:50,130
string.

70

00:04:50,440  -->  00:04:52,640
I could call Upper on it.

71

00:04:53,020  -->  00:04:54,870
And then we get that as an output.

72

00:04:55,300  -->  00:05:00,640
So what if you don't remember what these various attributes and methods are for a string or any object

73

00:05:01,090  -->  00:05:04,130
you can do as thoughts or whatever object you have.

74

00:05:04,330  -->  00:05:06,520
The DOT will be calling the method or attribute on it.

75

00:05:06,550  -->  00:05:11,620
And then if you click tab you'll get a little dropdown list of all the methods and attributes you can

76

00:05:11,620  -->  00:05:12,990
call an object.

77

00:05:13,000  -->  00:05:14,730
This is super useful to know.

78

00:05:14,980  -->  00:05:20,170
So again whenever you have an object and you want to call a method or attribute on it but you're not

79

00:05:20,170  -->  00:05:26,050
sure which ones are available you can have the object click that and then tab and open up a dropdown

80

00:05:26,050  -->  00:05:31,620
list for you and then if you click one of these let's say I want to do capitalize.

81

00:05:31,690  -->  00:05:33,280
I'm not sure what it does.

82

00:05:33,280  -->  00:05:37,950
I can just click shift tab and I'll return the docstring for that method.

83

00:05:38,610  -->  00:05:39,090
OK.

84

00:05:39,280  -->  00:05:42,950
So those are the main things to know what the Jupiter notebooks.

85

00:05:42,970  -->  00:05:47,110
One last good thing to know is that there's actually different types of cells.

86

00:05:47,230  -->  00:05:52,570
So go back to the first cell and delete the code from it and you can change the cell type.

87

00:05:52,570  -->  00:05:55,870
So Jupiter notebooks don't actually support just code.

88

00:05:55,880  -->  00:05:58,650
They can also support markdown and other cell types.

89

00:05:58,660  -->  00:06:04,930
So if you go here to this toolbar dropdown menu you'll find that right now we have a code cell I can

90

00:06:04,930  -->  00:06:09,300
click this and change it to a markdown cell.

91

00:06:09,380  -->  00:06:11,790
You'll notice that inbox goes away.

92

00:06:11,810  -->  00:06:17,250
Now I can actually write mark down which is just basic text so I can say hello.

93

00:06:17,500  -->  00:06:23,760
And when I run the cell either by clicking here or by saying shift enter You'll notice I just have marked

94

00:06:23,760  -->  00:06:24,730
out text.

95

00:06:24,820  -->  00:06:30,910
So that's up in Python or any coding is just marked down text in the markdown so I can double click

96

00:06:31,000  -->  00:06:32,740
to edit that text.

97

00:06:32,750  -->  00:06:35,320
So this supports various markdown syntax.

98

00:06:35,320  -->  00:06:41,570
So in case you're familiar with markdown syntax you can go ahead and take advantage of this.

99

00:06:41,800  -->  00:06:44,800
You'll see a lot of this markdown in the Jupiter notebooks.

100

00:06:44,860  -->  00:06:47,310
We have corresponding to every video lecture.

101

00:06:47,320  -->  00:06:48,630
So just keep that in mind.

102

00:06:48,700  -->  00:06:51,880
These are really useful for writing yourself notes or explanations.

103

00:06:51,880  -->  00:06:58,330
So for instance you just ran one plus one hit shift enter the next cell.

104

00:06:58,330  -->  00:07:04,750
I'm going to delete that and turn it into a markdown cell and then leave myself a little notes.

105

00:07:04,750  -->  00:07:12,490
I just added two numbers shift center to run it and here left myself a little know about what that cell

106

00:07:12,500  -->  00:07:18,750
does which sometimes might be nicer than writing a comment here.

107

00:07:20,530  -->  00:07:22,840
So that's totally up to you.

108

00:07:22,880  -->  00:07:26,730
There is a shortcut for making cells into markdown cells.

109

00:07:26,800  -->  00:07:33,200
The shortcut is clicking control em and then again but notice times like the cell.

110

00:07:33,220  -->  00:07:34,180
It's not going to work.

111

00:07:34,270  -->  00:07:40,570
So I have to click outside of the cell See Notice the highlighting click outside of the cell do control

112

00:07:40,570  -->  00:07:43,320
em once and then click em again.

113

00:07:43,600  -->  00:07:45,590
It will turn it to a markdown cell.

114

00:07:45,890  -->  00:07:53,440
And now you'll notice here I converted this into markdown text and all markdown Conventions apply here

115

00:07:53,440  -->  00:07:54,330
.

116

00:07:54,460  -->  00:07:59,330
You can go ahead and read more about markdown cells and mark them conventions if you want to know the

117

00:07:59,320  -->  00:08:03,000
various syntax that I can write here to edit the text itself.

118

00:08:03,400  -->  00:08:09,730
One last thing to note on markdown is it also supports latex in case you're familiar flater latex is

119

00:08:09,740  -->  00:08:12,380
just the ability to write mathematical equations.

120

00:08:12,500  -->  00:08:16,960
So for instance I can say as securty say of X here.

121

00:08:17,000  -->  00:08:18,570
See if that works.

122

00:08:19,030  -->  00:08:25,370
And here it's going to remove the print sees this are not actually needed.

123

00:08:26,820  -->  00:08:30,830
And I can write mathematical equations in the Jupiter notebooks.

124

00:08:30,850  -->  00:08:36,470
So that's also really useful for scientific computing and various aspects of mathematics and coding

125

00:08:36,460  -->  00:08:37,040
.

126

00:08:37,060  -->  00:08:42,140
Another good thing to know if you accidentally put for instance a while loop and it's running forever

127

00:08:42,130  -->  00:08:45,120
and you want to cancel or stop the notebook from running.

128

00:08:45,130  -->  00:08:51,400
You can go here to kernel and you can interrupt restart reconnect your kernel and that will allow you

129

00:08:51,400  -->  00:08:54,460
to basically reset the Jupiter notebook.

130

00:08:54,670  -->  00:08:57,680
That's all you need to know really for this course.

131

00:08:57,670  -->  00:09:05,590
One quick note in the resource section of this lecture there's a link to this manual here and this manual

132

00:09:05,600  -->  00:09:09,150
is basically the complete Jupiter notebook user's manual.

133

00:09:09,160  -->  00:09:16,070
It's has a lot of information and you can check it all out here goes over well we just went getting

134

00:09:16,070  -->  00:09:18,880
no Jupiter notebooks toolbar.

135

00:09:18,880  -->  00:09:25,040
It goes way beyond the basics talks about markdown cells raw cells and head her cells various cells

136

00:09:25,030  -->  00:09:29,630
that we don't use too often and this course we can go ahead and check it out here.

137

00:09:29,680  -->  00:09:35,210
One quick note in case you see people calling this an eye Python notebook Jupiter notebooks used to

138

00:09:35,200  -->  00:09:40,090
be called Eye Python notebooks until recently where they changed the name to reflect that it supports

139

00:09:40,150  -->  00:09:42,140
other languages than just Python.

140

00:09:42,130  -->  00:09:46,870
So just keep that in mind the python notebooks and super notebooks are essentially the same thing.

141

00:09:47,090  -->  00:09:50,270
