Hello and welcome to your third and last onsight question for your social network company mock interview

2

00:00:08.790  -->  00:00:11.100
your problem statement is this.

3

00:00:11.400  -->  00:00:18.150
Create a function that takes in a list of unsorted prices in the form of integers and the maximum possible

4

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:23.610
price value and then return a sorted list of prices.

5

00:00:23.610  -->  00:00:29.970
Here's your requirement your function should be able to perform this in less than 0 and log and time

6

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:30.840
.

7

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:36.320
Also you can't use any builtin methods in Python to do this.

8

00:00:36.600  -->  00:00:42.160
So again your function will take in a list of unsorted prices in the form of integers.

9

00:00:42.390  -->  00:00:50.200
So for example a list containing 3 7 and 4 and a maximum possible price value.

10

00:00:50.250  -->  00:00:55.520
In this case that would be 7 and then return a sorted list of prices.

11

00:00:55.650  -->  00:01:02.340
So to cure this problem is that you're given a list of unsorted prices and you also know the maximum

12

00:01:02.340  -->  00:01:04.050
possible price value.

13

00:01:04.050  -->  00:01:09.900
How can you take advantage of that fact to return a sorted list of prices in less than 0 and log in

14

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:10.660
time.

15

00:01:11.010  -->  00:01:13.110
All right this is a pretty tricky problem.

16

00:01:13.110  -->  00:01:16.340
So best of luck and I'll see at the next lecture.
