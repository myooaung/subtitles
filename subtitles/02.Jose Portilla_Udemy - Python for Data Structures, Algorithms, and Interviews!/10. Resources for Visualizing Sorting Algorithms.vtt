00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:05.560
Hello everyone and welcome to this side lecture on visualizing sorting algorithms.

2

00:00:05.580  -->  00:00:09.900
So in this lecture we're just going to give you some resources and websites that you can use to visualize

3

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:14.360
the sorting algorithms that we're going to be discussing throughout the rest of this section.

4

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:19.640
Keep in mind we will give you the resources and specific links for each sorting algorithm.

5

00:00:19.800  -->  00:00:25.410
As the lecture on that algorithm comes up so you'll be reminded on these links and have resources constantly

6

00:00:25.410  -->  00:00:27.170
throughout this section of the course.

7

00:00:27.280  -->  00:00:32.190
But what I want to do here is go ahead and show you the Web sites in particular how to use them and

8

00:00:32.190  -->  00:00:34.750
how to best take advantage of them for your learning.

9

00:00:34.770  -->  00:00:36.910
So let's go ahead and jump to the browser.

10

00:00:37.220  -->  00:00:37.550
OK.

11

00:00:37.560  -->  00:00:43.920
So the first web site I want you to be aware of is it w that sorting algorithms dot com.

12

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:49.440
This is a great Web site for visualizing sorting algorithms as well as seeing the pseudo code and basic

13

00:00:49.470  -->  00:00:51.470
algorithm definition.

14

00:00:51.480  -->  00:00:56.100
So for instance if you want to learn more about the insertion algorithm you click here on a specific

15

00:00:56.100  -->  00:01:01.620
algorithm name they'll go ahead and tell you about the pseudo code for the algorithm tell you it's properties

16

00:01:02.100  -->  00:01:04.150
give you a brief discussion on the algorithm.

17

00:01:04.440  -->  00:01:09.180
But if you want to actually visualize it we can do this you have four different options on the type

18

00:01:09.180  -->  00:01:10.390
of data you have.

19

00:01:10.610  -->  00:01:16.550
Go to them and it will begin to actually visualize the algorithm.

20

00:01:16.560  -->  00:01:20.050
So this is really useful and a great Web site.

21

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:24.070
Let's go ahead and check out another one that ex-wifes might want to check out.

22

00:01:24.180  -->  00:01:26.790
It's called visual algo dot net.

23

00:01:26.790  -->  00:01:31.140
That's the I O S u l g o dot net.

24

00:01:31.230  -->  00:01:33.300
Again this is a great Web site.

25

00:01:33.300  -->  00:01:36.860
You can have here the lists of algorithms you want to check out.

26

00:01:37.260  -->  00:01:43.260
If you go down to the left corner over here you can go ahead and say create if you want to create your

27

00:01:43.260  -->  00:01:46.570
own personal list and you click here.

28

00:01:46.650  -->  00:01:51.300
When you're ready to actually implement the sorting algorithm what's really great about this Web site

29

00:01:51.540  -->  00:01:57.600
is if you go over here on the right you'll notice there's two tabs you can go out and open them up and

30

00:01:57.600  -->  00:02:01.050
they will actually show you the pseudo code as you go along.

31

00:02:01.080  -->  00:02:03.610
And I'll tell you what line of the pseudo code you're on.

32

00:02:03.900  -->  00:02:07.250
So this is a really great Web site for learning the algorithms.

33

00:02:07.380  -->  00:02:13.200
Just keep in mind that there's differences in how you can actually implement the algorithm.

34

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:16.730
So some algorithms will implement the sorting from the left side.

35

00:02:16.890  -->  00:02:21.280
Others from the right side others will check if it's greater then some will check if it's less than

36

00:02:21.280  -->  00:02:21.660
.

37

00:02:21.690  -->  00:02:26.280
So although the basic concept of the algorithm is the same sometimes the way it's implemented is slightly

38

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:28.680
different than the way we do it in the lectures.

39

00:02:28.890  -->  00:02:30.800
But just keep that in mind.

40

00:02:30.990  -->  00:02:36.630
You can also change the speed of the algorithm here over at the bottom left corner and you can pause

41

00:02:36.630  -->  00:02:39.560
and play through each of the steps.

42

00:02:39.600  -->  00:02:45.750
Lastly Wikipedia if you just do a Wikipedia search on the algorithm it should usually have some sort

43

00:02:45.750  -->  00:02:53.670
of visualization that static as well as a visualization that's animated and all the information performance

44

00:02:53.670  -->  00:02:56.280
etc. about the algorithm is available for you.

45

00:02:56.310  -->  00:02:57.950
On the Wikipedia website.

46

00:02:58.470  -->  00:02:59.600
OK.

47

00:02:59.610  -->  00:03:02.290
So those are the main resources I wanted you to be aware of.

48

00:03:02.310  -->  00:03:07.700
WW does sorting dash algorithms dot com visual algo dot net.

49

00:03:07.770  -->  00:03:11.570
That's the SU a o dot net.

50

00:03:11.580  -->  00:03:17.500
And then Wikipedia pages you'll always have links to these visualization Web sites in the books.

51

00:03:17.520  -->  00:03:19.850
With that being said let's go ahead and get started.

52

00:03:20.070  -->  00:03:20.740
Thanks everyone.
