Hello everyone and welcome to your next riddle.

2

00:00:03,600  -->  00:00:05,340
This one's called light switches.

3

00:00:05,490  -->  00:00:09,000
Now a quick note before we begin this problem statement.

4

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:13,250
This question has a bit of a trick to it so don't spend too much time on it.

5

00:00:13,290  -->  00:00:17,460
It's more on the fun side of the brainteaser type questions.

6

00:00:17,460  -->  00:00:23,760
Now I personally think this kind of problem is more of a gotcha problem and it would be unfair to ask

7

00:00:23,760  -->  00:00:31,740
this riddle in an interview situation so I wouldn't expect this sort of riddle to be asked of you but

8

00:00:31,860  -->  00:00:33,400
it still might be fun to solve.

9

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:35,920
So here's the problem statement.

10

00:00:36,030  -->  00:00:40,970
You're in a hallway next to three light switches all of which are off.

11

00:00:41,100  -->  00:00:47,320
Each switch activates a different incandescent light bulb in the room at the end of the hall.

12

00:00:47,490  -->  00:00:52,920
You cannot see the lights from where the switches are so you can't see into the room.

13

00:00:52,920  -->  00:00:57,270
Your task is to determine which light corresponds to each switch.

14

00:00:57,270  -->  00:01:02,390
However you may only go into the room with the lights once.

15

00:01:02,540  -->  00:01:03,580
OK.

16

00:01:03,600  -->  00:01:05,100
Best of luck with this problem.

17

00:01:05,100  -->  00:01:09,830
Again don't spend too much time on it because there is a bit of a trick to it.

18

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:11,400
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
