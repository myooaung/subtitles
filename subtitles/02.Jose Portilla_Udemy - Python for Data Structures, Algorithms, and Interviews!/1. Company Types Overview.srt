00:00:01,260  -->  00:00:06,450
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on company types overview.

2

00:00:06,450  -->  00:00:11,100
So in this lecture we're going to give a brief overview of things you can expect from various company

3

00:00:11,100  -->  00:00:13,700
types and the size of companies.

4

00:00:14,120  -->  00:00:19,110
We're just going to cover what big four companies are like and what that term actually means.

5

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:25,190
Medium sized companies and then startups which are going to divide into startups that are small.

6

00:00:25,350  -->  00:00:30,840
Route 1 to 15 employees and then well-funded startups.

7

00:00:30,840  -->  00:00:34,230
OK so first off what is the term big for mean.

8

00:00:34,470  -->  00:00:39,600
So Big 4 is just a collective term for the top four large public tech companies.

9

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:45,300
And is actually more than four of them but the famous ones that are usually grouped together are Microsoft

10

00:00:45,330  -->  00:00:49,590
Facebook Amazon Apple and Google slash alphabet.

11

00:00:49,590  -->  00:00:55,800
So when someone's referring to the Big Four they usually mean some of these type of companies.

12

00:00:55,800  -->  00:00:57,420
So what do we know about the big four.

13

00:00:57,420  -->  00:01:00,600
Well the culture can actually vary greatly between all of them.

14

00:01:00,690  -->  00:01:05,750
So you should check out Glassdoor reviews for specific information on each of them since the culture

15

00:01:05,750  -->  00:01:12,770
of Amazon can be really different between the culture of Microsoft or Google or Facebook.

16

00:01:13,680  -->  00:01:18,480
We also know that they recruit heavily from the top five to ten universities based on the U.S. News

17

00:01:18,480  -->  00:01:19,480
rankings.

18

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:24,030
Since these are large public tech companies usually have some sort of strong management structure in

19

00:01:24,030  -->  00:01:29,020
place and some sort of formal onboarding process for new employees.

20

00:01:29,070  -->  00:01:34,020
You should also take into account that decisions at the company level need to take shareholders into

21

00:01:34,020  -->  00:01:42,420
account since there are large public companies now there are exceptions such as Amazon who has basically

22

00:01:42,720  -->  00:01:48,480
instead of focusing on profits have put a lot of their revenue back into the company.

23

00:01:48,480  -->  00:01:52,260
One last thing you should also note that they have a huge amount of applicants.

24

00:01:52,260  -->  00:01:58,770
So networking is the key to getting a job at a Big Four company.

25

00:01:58,770  -->  00:02:04,800
Up next are medium sized companies so these can vary greatly but they're usually local companies and

26

00:02:04,800  -->  00:02:07,560
they may have a few satellite offices.

27

00:02:07,740  -->  00:02:12,630
There also may be a stronger focus on profitability since if they're already a medium size company and

28

00:02:12,630  -->  00:02:16,800
don't have any funding source or not a startup they need to focus on profitability in order to keep

29

00:02:16,800  -->  00:02:18,370
the bills paid.

30

00:02:18,840  -->  00:02:21,330
Management structure can possibly be more informal.

31

00:02:21,330  -->  00:02:25,830
You have to try to ask about this during your interview and we'll touch more on medium sized companies

32

00:02:25,830  -->  00:02:31,250
in general later on this course and then startups.

33

00:02:31,290  -->  00:02:37,470
So focusing on small startups the ones to have between 1 to 15 employees you should note they usually

34

00:02:37,470  -->  00:02:43,470
offer lower salaries but higher equity he should also keep in mind the high probability of failure but

35

00:02:43,470  -->  00:02:47,760
90 percent of these startups fail within the first four years.

36

00:02:48,540  -->  00:02:52,760
Equity can also be a complicated subject so you should check out this link right here.

37

00:02:52,770  -->  00:02:58,380
Stock option counsel that come in just google around so you can really understand what an equity percentage

38

00:02:58,380  -->  00:03:02,620
means and the type of stocks that are available to you.

39

00:03:02,790  -->  00:03:06,540
The pros of a startup at this level is you're going to learn a lot but you're also going to have to

40

00:03:06,540  -->  00:03:07,510
work a lot.

41

00:03:07,890  -->  00:03:12,430
And it's important to understand that people and the early hires are key at this stage.

42

00:03:12,480  -->  00:03:16,440
So if you're interviewing at this type of company that's still small you should really make sure that

43

00:03:16,440  -->  00:03:19,940
you get along with everyone you interview with.

44

00:03:19,940  -->  00:03:24,150
So the other type of startup are the well-funded startups these are the type of companies that you've

45

00:03:24,150  -->  00:03:30,630
heard that have had huge funding rounds such as Oubre or lift's those kind of companies.

46

00:03:30,630  -->  00:03:36,560
So salaries at these well-funded startups can be comparable to big for large public tech companies.

47

00:03:36,660  -->  00:03:41,990
Petion note to equity at this stage can be pretty complicated given the large amount of funding rounds

48

00:03:41,990  -->  00:03:42,270
.

49

00:03:42,360  -->  00:03:47,400
So keep that in mind and really do your research to understand what an offer of equity really means

50

00:03:48,210  -->  00:03:54,030
for good list these type of companies you can check out breakout lists dot com and you should keep in

51

00:03:54,030  -->  00:03:58,860
mind that funding doesn't guarantee success.

52

00:03:58,860  -->  00:03:59,170
All right.

53

00:03:59,220  -->  00:04:04,020
So inclusion always research the companies beforehand and you should really be thinking about your work

54

00:04:04,020  -->  00:04:08,860
life balance and what your long term career goals are and what type of company is right for you.

55

00:04:09,210  -->  00:04:11,900
So were going to touch on this topic again later on this course.

56

00:04:11,910  -->  00:04:14,090
So this was just a brief overview.

57

00:04:14,100  -->  00:04:18,530
Up next we're going to get a brief overview of the various job types in programming.

58

00:04:18,840  -->  00:04:19,430
Okay.

59

00:04:19,620  -->  00:04:21,420
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture
