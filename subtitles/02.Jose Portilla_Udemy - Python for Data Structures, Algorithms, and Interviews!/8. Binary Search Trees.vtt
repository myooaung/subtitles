Hello everyone and welcome to the binary search trees lecture.

2

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:11.820
So just to give you a bit of a background we've already seen two different ways to get key value pairs

3

00:00:11.880  -->  00:00:13.220
in a collection.

4

00:00:13.440  -->  00:00:18.250
You can recall that these collections implemented the map abstract data type.

5

00:00:18.470  -->  00:00:25.380
The two implementations of a map abstract data type or ADT that we discussed were a binary search on

6

00:00:25.380  -->  00:00:30.150
a list and then hash tables in this section.

7

00:00:30.150  -->  00:00:37.170
What we're gonna do is study binary search trees as yet another way to map from a key to a value.

8

00:00:37.260  -->  00:00:42.250
In this case we are interested in the exact placement of the items in the tree.

9

00:00:42.390  -->  00:00:48.390
What we are interested in using the binary tree structure to provide for efficient searching capabilities

10

00:00:48.390  -->  00:00:50.370
.

11

00:00:50.370  -->  00:00:50.750
That means.

12

00:00:50.760  -->  00:00:56.340
Up next we're going to go over the implementation of a binary search tree we're won't live code this

13

00:00:56.340  -->  00:00:59.610
due to the sheer amount of code it's going to be a lot of code.

14

00:00:59.610  -->  00:01:01.790
So instead of having to live code it all out.

15

00:01:01.920  -->  00:01:06.180
Well we're going to do is instead of go through each block and explain it through diagrams just like

16

00:01:06.180  -->  00:01:08.830
we did in a few previous lectures.

17

00:01:08.940  -->  00:01:13.470
Again if you do want to access all the code it's written out free in the Jupiter notebooks and I'll

18

00:01:13.470  -->  00:01:19.380
be sure to show you those links when we go through the next lecture on binary search tree implementation

19

00:01:19.380  -->  00:01:20.250
.

20

00:01:20.250  -->  00:01:23.110
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
