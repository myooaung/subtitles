00:00:01.290  -->  00:00:05.800
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on five steps of an interview.

2

00:00:05.860  -->  00:00:10.920
This lecture we're going to discuss the five major components of the non-technical parts of an interview

3

00:00:10.920  -->  00:00:11.500
.

4

00:00:11.610  -->  00:00:18.240
Those include preparation arrival introduction communication and closing out the interview.

5

00:00:18.240  -->  00:00:20.780
So let's start with preparation.

6

00:00:20.940  -->  00:00:24.470
If you have a morning interview you're going to want to get up earlier than usual.

7

00:00:24.480  -->  00:00:31.020
So for instance if usually wake up at 7:00 a.m. in your interviews at 8:30 try to wake up either an

8

00:00:31.020  -->  00:00:33.200
hour or two hours before usual.

9

00:00:33.270  -->  00:00:38.910
So wake up around 6:00 that way once the interview comes around you're fully prepared and awake to tackle

10

00:00:38.910  -->  00:00:40.390
it head on.

11

00:00:40.440  -->  00:00:45.090
Also the day before makes you confirm the appointment time and location.

12

00:00:45.090  -->  00:00:47.220
Also make sure to bring extra resumes.

13

00:00:47.340  -->  00:00:51.930
A lot of times you'll be informed of how many separate interviews you'll be having in a day.

14

00:00:52.020  -->  00:00:55.590
For instance you'll know you'll have 4 half hour interviews.

15

00:00:55.740  -->  00:00:59.990
So always bring resumes for every person you're going to be interviewing with.

16

00:01:00.030  -->  00:01:04.950
They usually have some but sometimes they forget them or don't have them printed out for them.

17

00:01:04.980  -->  00:01:09.440
So make sure you bring extra resumes as a tool for them to help interview you.

18

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:14.280
Also always make sure you have proper directions and the name of the person you should ask for when

19

00:01:14.280  -->  00:01:16.590
you arrive.

20

00:01:16.590  -->  00:01:19.540
Up next your actual arrival.

21

00:01:19.830  -->  00:01:24.240
Make sure to arrive 10 to 12 minutes before the scheduled appointments.

22

00:01:24.240  -->  00:01:29.310
The moment you arrive you should consider yourself as making impressions on prospective employers.

23

00:01:29.310  -->  00:01:30.690
That includes everyone you meet.

24

00:01:30.680  -->  00:01:37.080
From the moment you step out of your car you want to show confidence and smile and make a strong initial

25

00:01:37.110  -->  00:01:40.290
impact also before meeting the receptionist.

26

00:01:40.290  -->  00:01:41.710
You should visit the restroom.

27

00:01:41.930  -->  00:01:47.170
View your appearance and take care of any business and then be aware of your body language.

28

00:01:47.190  -->  00:01:53.010
It's really important that you come off as a nice confident person even before you actually start your

29

00:01:53.010  -->  00:01:55.750
formal interview.

30

00:01:56.040  -->  00:01:57.660
Then your introduction.

31

00:01:57.660  -->  00:02:01.990
So make sure to give a firm handshake a smile while maintaining eye contact.

32

00:02:02.280  -->  00:02:07.290
You should speak with confidence and energy and you should also try to determine that specific interviewers

33

00:02:07.290  -->  00:02:10.110
communication style and adapt to it.

34

00:02:10.800  -->  00:02:16.660
So for instance if he or she tends to break into smile frequently you should also be smiling often.

35

00:02:16.980  -->  00:02:18.080
If he or she doesn't.

36

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:25.100
You want to avoid grinning too much so try to adapt to your interviewers communication style.

37

00:02:25.170  -->  00:02:27.730
Up next communication in general.

38

00:02:27.960  -->  00:02:32.220
So make good use of openings and what I mean by that is.

39

00:02:32.550  -->  00:02:37.680
For example if the interviewer begins by saying Tell me about yourself you're already in control of

40

00:02:37.680  -->  00:02:39.170
an early part of the meeting.

41

00:02:39.480  -->  00:02:45.390
So deliver a quick 30 second personal overview of your background maybe beginning with education followed

42

00:02:45.390  -->  00:02:49.470
by some sort of 60 to 90 second overview of your career.

43

00:02:49.530  -->  00:02:55.670
So like X numbers of years doing this and that working for them and these other people ok.

44

00:02:55.890  -->  00:03:00.660
After that you really want to make sure you communicate your skills qualifications and credentials clearly

45

00:03:01.920  -->  00:03:04.670
then demonstrate your ability to adapt and learn.

46

00:03:04.830  -->  00:03:10.530
You'll probably ask some sort of situational questions which will go over later in this course but questions

47

00:03:10.530  -->  00:03:12.170
such as What have you.

48

00:03:12.180  -->  00:03:17.160
Have you ever been a position where you had to make a tough decision or have you ever had a disagreement

49

00:03:17.160  -->  00:03:18.780
with a former colleague.

50

00:03:18.780  -->  00:03:19.950
Those kind of questions.

51

00:03:20.080  -->  00:03:23.430
I remember plan prepare practice and rehearse.

52

00:03:23.430  -->  00:03:28.820
There is no substitute for good practice for an interview.

53

00:03:29.160  -->  00:03:32.840
Next closing make sure to ask follow up questions.

54

00:03:32.850  -->  00:03:37.580
We actually have a list of potential follow up questions for you to use right before the technical section

55

00:03:38.070  -->  00:03:39.640
so you can go in and check out that video.

56

00:03:39.660  -->  00:03:41.760
And the list of questions for you to ask.

57

00:03:42.120  -->  00:03:48.000
Then you'll want to review salary and compensation package after you receive an offer.

58

00:03:48.000  -->  00:03:48.770
So that's it.

59

00:03:48.770  -->  00:03:50.100
For those 5 steps.

60

00:03:50.100  -->  00:03:53.380
Those are just the non-technical portions overviews.

61

00:03:53.550  -->  00:03:58.770
So after this we're going to go into some especially challenging interview questions called the tough

62

00:03:58.860  -->  00:04:04.020
interview questions lecture and we'll discuss some tough interview questions how to approach them how

63

00:04:04.020  -->  00:04:05.680
best to answer them.

64

00:04:05.700  -->  00:04:08.350
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
