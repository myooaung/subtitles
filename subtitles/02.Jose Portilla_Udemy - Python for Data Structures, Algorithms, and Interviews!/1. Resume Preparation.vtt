00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:06.690
Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on resume preparation.

2

00:00:06.900  -->  00:00:12.510
So what we're going to do for this lecture is check out a sample resume and highlight 12 key factors

3

00:00:12.510  -->  00:00:14.640
from it.

4

00:00:14.640  -->  00:00:16.940
So you're left we have our own example resume.

5

00:00:17.220  -->  00:00:20.150
And the first thing we're going to notice is that it's one page.

6

00:00:20.460  -->  00:00:23.010
So recruiters do not read your resume.

7

00:00:23.160  -->  00:00:28.560
They do about a 15 to 30 second spot check of your resume when your resume is too long.

8

00:00:28.560  -->  00:00:34.170
It just takes your best stuff the stuff that would have made it one page cut and dilutes it with more

9

00:00:34.170  -->  00:00:35.630
mediocre content.

10

00:00:35.910  -->  00:00:40.400
So lengthy resumes don't make you more impressive.

11

00:00:40.410  -->  00:00:45.000
A good rule of thumb is to keep your resume to one page if you have less than 10 years of experience

12

00:00:45.370  -->  00:00:49.650
or at most two pages if you have more than 10 years of experience.

13

00:00:49.650  -->  00:00:53.520
The second point you want to make here is there is no objective statement.

14

00:00:53.520  -->  00:01:00.450
So all the objective does is stay in a wordy way what position interested in the company already knows

15

00:01:00.450  -->  00:01:02.980
that because you applied for a particular position.

16

00:01:03.030  -->  00:01:08.550
So at best it's just going to waste space and at worst it will limit use and will exclude other positions

17

00:01:08.550  -->  00:01:12.830
that might have been interesting to you that the company may have been considering you for.

18

00:01:12.840  -->  00:01:18.600
So again my recommendation is to not put in an objective statement on your resume.

19

00:01:18.600  -->  00:01:22.530
Third point you want to make here is to use a resume template with columns.

20

00:01:22.590  -->  00:01:27.120
So unless you're great design you probably shouldn't be creating your own resume template.

21

00:01:27.120  -->  00:01:30.050
They'll most likely just look sloppy sloppy.

22

00:01:30.060  -->  00:01:36.210
So after this lecture we'll go over some resume creation tools and in the third lecture of this section

23

00:01:36.570  -->  00:01:39.420
there's actually a list of a resume Creation web sites.

24

00:01:39.450  -->  00:01:42.180
So again you'll be using a template of some sort.

25

00:01:42.210  -->  00:01:47.400
Don't try to do it on your own unless you're actually applying for a position where design is a key

26

00:01:47.400  -->  00:01:52.140
factor to your skills.

27

00:01:52.140  -->  00:01:54.300
Number four use tables.

28

00:01:54.300  -->  00:01:59.130
So again if you're using Microsoft words create your resume which you probably should or at least some

29

00:01:59.130  -->  00:02:04.050
sort of word Ed. You should use Microsoft words tables.

30

00:02:04.050  -->  00:02:06.510
Just make sure to hide the borders afterwards.

31

00:02:06.780  -->  00:02:13.510
So if you look at number four here this allows you to organize things better.

32

00:02:13.620  -->  00:02:20.160
So point number five that we want to make is to keep bullets short because resume screeners only spend

33

00:02:20.400  -->  00:02:24.240
anywhere between 15 and 30 seconds on your resume.

34

00:02:24.240  -->  00:02:29.590
The length of the bullets anything that feels like a paragraph just won't get read.

35

00:02:29.820  -->  00:02:36.130
So keep your bullets to one or two lines with one line being better than two.

36

00:02:36.780  -->  00:02:43.050
Point number six we want to make is that accomplishment oriented so your bullets should focus on your

37

00:02:43.050  -->  00:02:44.250
accomplishments.

38

00:02:44.310  -->  00:02:48.440
That is the impact you had rather than your responsibilities.

39

00:02:48.450  -->  00:02:54.990
Sheesh you should be describing what did you build create zine optimized lead etc..

40

00:02:55.050  -->  00:02:59.030
Another key factor to a good bullet point is to quantify things.

41

00:02:59.130  -->  00:03:04.740
So whenever possible you should quantify your accomplishments if you optimize something by how much

42

00:03:05.030  -->  00:03:10.410
if you want an award out of how many people if you save the certain amount of money on a project how

43

00:03:10.410  -->  00:03:13.230
much.

44

00:03:13.560  -->  00:03:20.190
OK this is more for students but on number eights you're a general rule of thumb is to list your GPA

45

00:03:20.400  -->  00:03:23.060
it's at least 3.0 or higher.

46

00:03:23.220  -->  00:03:25.350
But there are two important rules to know here.

47

00:03:25.350  -->  00:03:31.680
The first one is you may choose to list your in major GPA if it's higher than your overall GPA but you

48

00:03:31.680  -->  00:03:34.510
need to specify that it's your major GPA.

49

00:03:34.710  -->  00:03:40.230
Point number two here is if your school uses a different scale such as a ten point scale you may want

50

00:03:40.230  -->  00:03:45.780
to convert your GPA to a 4.0 scale which would be a more widely understood especially if you're applying

51

00:03:45.780  -->  00:03:49.980
to USA companies.

52

00:03:50.100  -->  00:03:52.610
Point Number nine is projects.

53

00:03:52.650  -->  00:03:57.840
So most candidates should pick their top three to five projects to list on their resume.

54

00:03:57.840  -->  00:04:03.600
These can be academic required projects or just independent projects that you decided to take on.

55

00:04:03.600  -->  00:04:07.020
They do not need to be completed or launched either.

56

00:04:07.200  -->  00:04:12.180
As long as you done enough for the media to work on them that's good enough to put them on your resume

57

00:04:12.180  -->  00:04:13.940
.

58

00:04:13.950  -->  00:04:19.980
Point number 10 on additional experience so you can put additional experience like leadership activities

59

00:04:19.980  -->  00:04:24.240
or awards in a section like this such as shown on this resume.

60

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:27.900
So change the name of the section depending on what you list.

61

00:04:27.900  -->  00:04:30.080
Be careful here to focus on what really matters.

62

00:04:30.120  -->  00:04:34.800
If you're applying for a coding role your role as an Eagle Scout in high school is probably not really

63

00:04:34.800  -->  00:04:43.320
important or relevant to the position you're applying to 11 languages and technologies so it's a good

64

00:04:43.320  -->  00:04:48.360
idea to list your languages and technologies but remember that anything you list here will be fair game

65

00:04:48.360  -->  00:04:49.980
for the interviewer to test.

66

00:04:50.010  -->  00:04:54.390
So if you want to list the language you happen to be a little rusty in it consider listing it as something

67

00:04:54.390  -->  00:04:58.860
like C++ proficient C-Sharp prior experience etc..

68

00:04:59.070  -->  00:05:04.400
So you actually quantify your experience in each of those programming languages.

69

00:05:05.070  -->  00:05:06.220
So point twelve.

70

00:05:06.300  -->  00:05:08.400
What did you not include.

71

00:05:08.400  -->  00:05:13.200
So you got to remember is there anything impressive or interesting that you've done that you left out

72

00:05:13.200  -->  00:05:13.620
.

73

00:05:13.890  -->  00:05:18.180
About 50 percent of candidates leave out an important project or other component of their experience

74

00:05:18.600  -->  00:05:20.700
because it wasn't finished or official enough.

75

00:05:20.730  -->  00:05:25.710
So if you've done it and it's impressive enough to make the cut you shouldn't just list everything you've

76

00:05:25.710  -->  00:05:26.400
ever done.

77

00:05:26.400  -->  00:05:27.500
Keep that in mind.

78

00:05:27.810  -->  00:05:34.870
But if you're if it's impressive enough to make the cut that it belongs on your resume.

79

00:05:35.100  -->  00:05:41.400
All right so Up next our resume builder Web sites and a list of resume Creation web sites.

80

00:05:41.460  -->  00:05:42.420
Thanks everyone.

81

00:05:42.450  -->  00:05:43.500
I'll see you at the next lecture
