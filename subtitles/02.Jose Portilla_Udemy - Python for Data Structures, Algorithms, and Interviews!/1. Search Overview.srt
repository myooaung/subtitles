Hello everyone and welcome to the search overview lecture.

2

00:00:05,130  -->  00:00:10,770
So this entire section consists of searching and sorting those algorithms and how they work in Python

3

00:00:11,290  -->  00:00:15,930
for the first half of the section we'll discuss search methods and then in the second half of the section

4

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:17,580
we'll discuss sorting.

5

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:21,120
So right now we're just talking about search.

6

00:00:21,240  -->  00:00:25,800
So in this half of the section we'll discuss quenches search will do an implementation of sequential

7

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:26,630
search.

8

00:00:26,640  -->  00:00:31,140
Talk about binary search as well as an implementation of that and then we'll talk about hashing and

9

00:00:31,140  -->  00:00:33,400
hash tables.

10

00:00:33,390  -->  00:00:35,380
So a quick no.

11

00:00:35,580  -->  00:00:39,950
In python we can use the in operator to search for elements in a list.

12

00:00:40,170  -->  00:00:46,260
So for example a quick screenshot here at the bottom you can check if 15 is in that list which is not

13

00:00:46,260  -->  00:00:49,000
so returns a boolean false.

14

00:00:49,320  -->  00:00:55,380
And then you can also check if 3 is in that list which it is sir returns a boolean true.

15

00:00:55,440  -->  00:01:00,930
So you want to really knows how does the underlying process actually work and what's the best way to

16

00:01:00,930  -->  00:01:04,890
search for things algorithmically what's actually happening under the hood.

17

00:01:04,950  -->  00:01:08,870
When you say something like 15 in this list.

18

00:01:09,060  -->  00:01:13,230
So what we're going to do is go ahead and get started by learning about sequential search and binary

19

00:01:13,230  -->  00:01:20,390
search and hashing and see how those topics relate to actually searching for items or elements in a

20

00:01:20,440  -->  00:01:21,210
list.

21

00:01:21,500  -->  00:01:22,090
OK.

22

00:01:22,440  -->  00:01:24,430
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

23

00:01:24,480  -->  00:01:26,300
We're going to discuss sequential search
