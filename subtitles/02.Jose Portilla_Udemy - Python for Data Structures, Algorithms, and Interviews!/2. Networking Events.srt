Hello everyone and welcome to networking events and this lecture we're going to discuss how networking

2

00:00:06,810  -->  00:00:12,120
events and Web sites can help bring you into contact with people directly involved in the industries

3

00:00:12,180  -->  00:00:13,900
you're interested in.

4

00:00:13,900  -->  00:00:17,190
Let's go ahead and discuss some popular tools.

5

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:23,160
First off just general conferences you could consider going to a conference to meet people in your industry

6

00:00:23,160  -->  00:00:23,720
.

7

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:26,780
Many conferences also have hiring fairs.

8

00:00:26,790  -->  00:00:32,340
Best way to find relevant conferences is by googling either the topic or programming language you're

9

00:00:32,370  -->  00:00:33,290
interested in.

10

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:39,810
Plus conference most official and large programming languages have some sort of conference related to

11

00:00:39,810  -->  00:00:40,670
them.

12

00:00:40,680  -->  00:00:46,110
So for example if you google Python plus conference it should lead you to pikemen which also has a hiring

13

00:00:46,110  -->  00:00:47,580
pair attached to it.

14

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:53,370
You Google something like Python plus data science post.com Prince you'll get to PI data which is another

15

00:00:53,640  -->  00:00:57,750
python data science related conference.

16

00:00:58,200  -->  00:00:59,520
There's also meet ups.

17

00:00:59,760  -->  00:01:04,980
So it's one of the original source for networking and it's stody though that meet up dotcom what it

18

00:01:04,980  -->  00:01:11,580
is that allows you to meet up with people in your local area who are interested in the same topics you

19

00:01:11,580  -->  00:01:14,020
are.

20

00:01:14,100  -->  00:01:20,220
So go to meet up dotcom and look up programming languages and topics you're interested in.

21

00:01:20,340  -->  00:01:26,960
Also want you to be aware of eventful and events brights the meet ups or excuse me the events uneventful

22

00:01:26,970  -->  00:01:33,660
and events brights you won't get a gathering of like minded individuals meeting up to discuss stuff

23

00:01:33,660  -->  00:01:34,200
.

24

00:01:34,200  -->  00:01:38,700
You'll get more of a professional on officially event field there and you'll need to buy tickets for

25

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:39,440
those events.

26

00:01:39,480  -->  00:01:43,870
So just keep that in mind as you explore those websites.

27

00:01:43,980  -->  00:01:49,590
Finally as far as your assignments you should at least create a meet up profile so you can get notified

28

00:01:49,590  -->  00:01:54,850
of relevant meet ups in your area.

29

00:01:54,890  -->  00:01:57,560
All right that's it for this lecture in this section.

30

00:01:57,870  -->  00:02:02,960
Hopefully you have a good idea now of the basics of networking and I'll see at the next lecture.

31

00:02:02,970  -->  00:02:03,550
Thanks everyone
