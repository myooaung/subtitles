Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview problem is called a great pair.

2

00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:12,360
Some could this problem even an integer array output all the unique pairs that sum up to a specific

3

00:00:12,360  -->  00:00:13,400
value.

4

00:00:13,830  -->  00:00:21,090
So for example here's a function called pair underscore some takes into arguments a list so that array

5

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:23,230
and then a specific value.

6

00:00:23,530  -->  00:00:24,770
This case for.

7

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:29,060
And it would return two pairs 1 and three and then 2 and 2.

8

00:00:29,070  -->  00:00:31,690
So you have two pairs here that are unique.

9

00:00:31,690  -->  00:00:36,750
I can sum up to this value for quick no for testing purposes.

10

00:00:36,810  -->  00:00:40,060
Change your function so outputs the number of pairs.

11

00:00:40,100  -->  00:00:42,490
So in this case it would just output to.

12

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:46,960
However your function should still be able to return the pairs themselves but at the end.

13

00:00:47,040  -->  00:00:51,680
Just count the number of pairs if you want to test your solution using the test cell.

14

00:00:52,020  -->  00:00:58,080
So Phil your solution here below and then run this test cell to test your solution.

15

00:00:58,110  -->  00:00:58,980
All right.

16

00:00:58,980  -->  00:01:00,350
Best of luck to everyone.

17

00:01:00,360  -->  00:01:01,900
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
