00:00:01,050  -->  00:00:06,060
Hello everyone and welcome to the solution for the phone screen for the e-commerce company mock interview

2

00:00:06,080  -->  00:00:06,590
.

3

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:09,330
So this was the egg problem.

4

00:00:09,360  -->  00:00:11,170
You should have seen this before in the middle section.

5

00:00:11,190  -->  00:00:16,430
But just to reiterate what the problem statement was basically you have two eggs 100 floors.

6

00:00:16,500  -->  00:00:20,200
The eggs are strong enough so that they can be dropped from a particular floor in the tower without

7

00:00:20,210  -->  00:00:21,000
breaking.

8

00:00:21,210  -->  00:00:24,790
If you drop them below that target floor they're going they're not going to break.

9

00:00:24,880  -->  00:00:26,220
You drop it above you.

10

00:00:26,250  -->  00:00:27,260
They will break.

11

00:00:27,270  -->  00:00:30,390
So how can you find out what the highest floor in it can be.

12

00:00:30,390  -->  00:00:34,550
Drop that without breaking in as few drops possible.

13

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:37,100
It's going see the solution for this.

14

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:41,730
So if you don't understand the solution there's tons of different explanations online.

15

00:00:41,850  -->  00:00:47,370
You can just google two eggs 100 floors and they'll basically go over different ways of showing you

16

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:49,290
the same solution.

17

00:00:49,290  -->  00:00:54,540
But let's go ahead and get a basic idea of how we can go about this logically.

18

00:00:54,540  -->  00:01:01,550
So let's say you start from floor number 10 and go up two floors in multiples of 10.

19

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:09,100
If that first egg breaks say at the 20th floor then you can check all the floors between 11 and 19 with

20

00:01:09,120  -->  00:01:12,230
the second egg to see which floor it will not break.

21

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:16,220
So in that case your worst case for number drops is 19.

22

00:01:16,500  -->  00:01:21,420
If the threshold was the ninety ninth floor then you could have then you would have to drop the egg

23

00:01:21,420  -->  00:01:22,600
at least 10 times.

24

00:01:22,630  -->  00:01:26,470
And the second egg nine times in that linear fashion.

25

00:01:26,580  -->  00:01:31,820
So for the best solution what we need to do is minimize the worst case number drops.

26

00:01:31,830  -->  00:01:34,360
So for that let's go ahead and generalize that problem.

27

00:01:34,470  -->  00:01:37,830
And of course this is something you should definitely do in an interview.

28

00:01:37,830  -->  00:01:39,120
Generalizing problems.

29

00:01:39,120  -->  00:01:41,280
That's huge.

30

00:01:41,280  -->  00:01:45,840
The interviewer will really like that you do that and it's really necessary to solve this problem.

31

00:01:45,920  -->  00:01:50,310
So be the step value for that first egg is it's still going to be 10.

32

00:01:50,350  -->  00:01:54,570
If we have 200 floors or a thousand of floors how do we figure that out.

33

00:01:54,570  -->  00:01:59,880
So the point to note here is that we're trying to minimize the worst case number of drops which happens

34

00:01:59,880  -->  00:02:02,430
if the threshold is at the highest floor.

35

00:02:02,430  -->  00:02:09,130
So our steps should be of some value which reduces the number of drops of that first egg.

36

00:02:09,270  -->  00:02:17,710
So let's assume we take some that value am initially then every subsequent step is minus one.

37

00:02:17,720  -->  00:02:22,280
So you have an plus and minus 1 plus and minus two plus.

38

00:02:22,340  -->  00:02:27,830
All the way to plus one equals and that in and number of floors.

39

00:02:28,140  -->  00:02:36,210
And so this is actually a series which you can describe as n times and plus 1 divided by two equals

40

00:02:36,210  -->  00:02:36,250
.

41

00:02:36,270  -->  00:02:39,650
And this is a little this is basically the trick to the problem.

42

00:02:39,660  -->  00:02:47,060
If we're able to convert this into this equation you can probably get here by yourself but realizing

43

00:02:47,130  -->  00:02:50,220
that it equals this is a little trickier.

44

00:02:50,220  -->  00:02:50,780
All right.

45

00:02:50,940  -->  00:02:58,980
So now that we know we have 100 floors if any equals 100 and you solve for m here then you'd get thirteen

46

00:02:59,070  -->  00:03:05,470
point six five Anson's thirteen point six five as a decimal of a floor.

47

00:03:05,520  -->  00:03:07,620
We're actually going to rounded up to 14.

48

00:03:07,650  -->  00:03:14,980
So now we know that worst case scenario is when the threshold of 100 floors the first 14 floors with

49

00:03:15,000  -->  00:03:17,420
the number drops being 14.

50

00:03:17,550  -->  00:03:22,950
So this is actually just a simple binary search and that's really what your question is getting it.

51

00:03:23,100  -->  00:03:26,360
If you're aware of how a binary search works.

52

00:03:26,590  -->  00:03:27,110
All right.

53

00:03:27,480  -->  00:03:32,730
But that being said if you need to review anything for this problem definitely review what a binary

54

00:03:32,770  -->  00:03:36,780
searches because that's really the key to understanding this problem.

55

00:03:36,780  -->  00:03:38,960
All right go ahead and review the solution.

56

00:03:38,970  -->  00:03:41,080
Make sure you know this problem pretty well.

57

00:03:41,130  -->  00:03:44,970
It's probably the most common riddle or brainteaser out there.

58

00:03:44,970  -->  00:03:45,340
All right.

59

00:03:45,390  -->  00:03:49,920
But that being said let's go ahead and move onto the next solution.
