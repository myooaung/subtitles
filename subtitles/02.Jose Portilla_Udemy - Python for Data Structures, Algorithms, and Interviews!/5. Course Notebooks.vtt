00:00:01.170  -->  00:00:04.680
Hello everyone and welcome to the course notebooks lecture.

2

00:00:04.800  -->  00:00:08.820
A quick note you should go to the resource section of this lecture for the link to the course.

3

00:00:08.820  -->  00:00:12.310
No there will be two links one to the viewer.

4

00:00:12.330  -->  00:00:19.140
The python that or link the notebooks and then also one to the Direct github repository link.

5

00:00:19.140  -->  00:00:24.330
I suggest you always check out the view of the Python the orch first because it looks a lot cleaner

6

00:00:24.510  -->  00:00:25.820
and loads faster.

7

00:00:26.100  -->  00:00:32.280
But in case that one goes down when it does go down it's because there's too many people using it.

8

00:00:32.280  -->  00:00:35.060
It doesn't happen often but has happened in the past.

9

00:00:35.160  -->  00:00:38.560
Then you can go ahead and go straight to github which is almost never down.

10

00:00:38.910  -->  00:00:44.490
But that being said go ahead and click the end be viewer link and it'll take you to the resource section

11

00:00:44.730  -->  00:00:45.390
for the course.

12

00:00:45.390  -->  00:00:48.410
Notebooks are going to go ahead and jump to that now.

13

00:00:49.050  -->  00:00:54.240
All right everyone we're here at the end of Bieger at the Python the link for the course's repository

14

00:00:54.270  -->  00:00:56.100
for all the notebooks.

15

00:00:56.100  -->  00:01:01.380
The other link will take you to the hub which is in this tab here.

16

00:01:01.380  -->  00:01:04.610
As you notice there's a lot more going on here and it's not as pretty.

17

00:01:04.620  -->  00:01:09.550
So I always suggest checking out and of or the IPART from the org first.

18

00:01:09.570  -->  00:01:15.930
Also the notebooks tend to load much faster on this Web site versus on hub but notebooks can be read

19

00:01:15.930  -->  00:01:18.740
there or both and be viewer and hub.

20

00:01:18.810  -->  00:01:21.470
So let's go ahead and go over one example would look like.

21

00:01:21.480  -->  00:01:24.000
For particular lecture in the course.

22

00:01:24.000  -->  00:01:28.620
Let's say here in the linked lists section of the course you will just go ahead and click the folder

23

00:01:28.890  -->  00:01:32.630
that is named after that section and you'll see.

24

00:01:32.890  -->  00:01:37.230
Python books are Jupiter notebooks that are IPY and B files.

25

00:01:37.230  -->  00:01:40.340
These are notebooks that are associated for lecture of the same name.

26

00:01:40.500  -->  00:01:45.780
So if you have a lecturer such as linked list overview which is basically the first lecture in that

27

00:01:45.780  -->  00:01:50.480
section of the course which does a very quick overview or doing you should get this brief note book

28

00:01:50.490  -->  00:01:56.220
and if you click on it you'll get this notebook which is just a brief overview of the topics we cover

29

00:01:56.220  -->  00:01:58.000
in this course.

30

00:01:58.520  -->  00:02:02.110
For more technical lectures do you go back here.

31

00:02:02.160  -->  00:02:04.920
Maybe we do a double linked list implementation.

32

00:02:05.220  -->  00:02:11.730
You can go ahead and click that I'll open a new tab and you'll see here where we have comments and all

33

00:02:11.730  -->  00:02:12.720
the example code.

34

00:02:12.750  -->  00:02:14.730
Now we go over in the video.

35

00:02:14.730  -->  00:02:20.700
So if you're feeling more advanced of a programmer or you already know a topic pretty well then you

36

00:02:20.700  -->  00:02:22.580
can just go ahead and check out the notebook.

37

00:02:22.590  -->  00:02:23.750
Run through it.

38

00:02:23.750  -->  00:02:27.660
Do you have any questions then you can go ahead and check out the video where I explain every line of

39

00:02:27.660  -->  00:02:30.440
the code and code it out with you.

40

00:02:30.570  -->  00:02:33.360
All right let's go ahead and jump back.

41

00:02:34.010  -->  00:02:35.450
Here we are.

42

00:02:35.610  -->  00:02:36.560
A quick no.

43

00:02:36.630  -->  00:02:41.600
Some notebooks that are associated the lecture where the lecturer doesn't have a lot of code.

44

00:02:41.600  -->  00:02:48.360
With more on theory if you click that for instance the W links lists lecture you'll notice I'll say

45

00:02:48.360  -->  00:02:51.420
refer to the video lecture for the full explanation.

46

00:02:51.420  -->  00:02:56.520
So the reason for that is we don't really do a lot of coding in that lecture and it's really a bunch

47

00:02:56.520  -->  00:02:59.540
of figures that are hard to put in a Jupiter notebook format.

48

00:02:59.790  -->  00:03:04.350
So if you ever see this you should definitely refer to the video lecture for the full information on

49

00:03:04.350  -->  00:03:05.900
that topic.

50

00:03:05.940  -->  00:03:08.260
Let's go ahead and close these.

51

00:03:09.450  -->  00:03:11.980
So again here is the repository.

52

00:03:12.060  -->  00:03:16.800
If this link is ever down this would be viewers link which is should favorite.

53

00:03:16.860  -->  00:03:20.860
By the way then you can just go ahead and go to the link.

54

00:03:21.450  -->  00:03:24.310
And this should almost never be down and you'll get the same thing.

55

00:03:24.310  -->  00:03:27.510
So if we go a linked list here then we click.

56

00:03:27.510  -->  00:03:32.650
For instance on the linked list implementation you'll notice it takes a little longer to load.

57

00:03:32.750  -->  00:03:35.210
It'll still render and you can get it here.

58

00:03:35.730  -->  00:03:41.070
One thing to know in case you're interested in downloading the notebooks you can always just go to a

59

00:03:41.090  -->  00:03:47.970
notebook for instance double linked lists here are double Englis implementation and click the download

60

00:03:47.970  -->  00:03:49.130
button here.

61

00:03:49.530  -->  00:03:54.450
So you also have a link to the direct github but if you click this right mudslinger let me go ahead

62

00:03:54.450  -->  00:03:56.810
and zoom in on it.

63

00:03:58.350  -->  00:03:59.860
So you get the stropped down.

64

00:04:00.210  -->  00:04:02.930
You'll get a download notebook if you really zoomed in.

65

00:04:02.940  -->  00:04:05.370
It looks like this is going to zoom back out.

66

00:04:05.410  -->  00:04:13.920
It's right here top corner just left click and you should be downloading a IPY and B file but that wherever

67

00:04:13.920  -->  00:04:17.670
you're storing the rest of your notebooks then then you should be able to see it when you start the

68

00:04:17.670  -->  00:04:19.570
Jupiter notebook server.

69

00:04:20.370  -->  00:04:26.280
If you want to check out that particular view or excuse me Jupiter note book in get home.

70

00:04:26.490  -->  00:04:28.390
You can click the link here.

71

00:04:28.500  -->  00:04:36.030
Also open it in the new tab and it will take you to this right here which is that same book just there

72

00:04:36.040  -->  00:04:38.380
and get one quick note.

73

00:04:38.430  -->  00:04:41.570
You should really be using Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

74

00:04:41.580  -->  00:04:47.070
I highly suggest Chrome this rendering of notebooks and just Jubran notebooks by themselves don't tend

75

00:04:47.070  -->  00:04:47.670
to work well.

76

00:04:47.690  -->  00:04:49.820
Internet Explorer or other browsers.

77

00:04:50.190  -->  00:04:52.010
So just keep that in mind.

78

00:04:52.620  -->  00:04:58.170
One last note is if you're interested in downloading all the notebooks for the entire repo you can go

79

00:04:58.170  -->  00:05:00.330
ahead and click back to the original link.

80

00:05:00.510  -->  00:05:02.840
Click here and get a view on it.

81

00:05:02.910  -->  00:05:06.500
It's this little octo cat and you click it.

82

00:05:06.510  -->  00:05:12.540
It'll take you this page right here and you can click download zip and that will allow you to download

83

00:05:12.630  -->  00:05:15.830
a zip of all the folders and files.

84

00:05:15.840  -->  00:05:20.150
Keep in mind we may be adding new stuff in the future so you may have to read download.

85

00:05:20.190  -->  00:05:25.580
I suggest Fusion just download as you need them or copy and paste from the notebooks themselves.

86

00:05:25.590  -->  00:05:29.180
Let's go ahead and go back for one quick note.

87

00:05:29.880  -->  00:05:34.420
You'll notice that there's interview problems for almost every section of the course.

88

00:05:34.440  -->  00:05:36.540
At least all the technical sections.

89

00:05:36.840  -->  00:05:42.930
If you click here there's a subfolder for each section labeled that section's name and interview problems

90

00:05:42.930  -->  00:05:43.410
.

91

00:05:43.410  -->  00:05:46.390
So right now we're on the linked lists section of the course.

92

00:05:46.470  -->  00:05:51.330
We have the lecturers that go over the theory and the notebooks that correspond to those and then we

93

00:05:51.330  -->  00:05:52.640
have the interview problems.

94

00:05:52.650  -->  00:05:59.730
So if I click on this folder they'll take us to two folders one will be the problems themselves and

95

00:05:59.730  -->  00:06:01.870
another will be the solutions.

96

00:06:01.950  -->  00:06:07.320
You can go ahead and click the interview problems and then click on let's say the first one implements

97

00:06:07.470  -->  00:06:11.490
a doubly linked list and you'll get a for this interview problem.

98

00:06:11.490  -->  00:06:12.890
Basically the problem statement.

99

00:06:13.110  -->  00:06:21.430
Implement a node class and Shobhaa blah Englis in pretty much all of the interview problem notebooks

100

00:06:21.440  -->  00:06:21.860
.

101

00:06:21.990  -->  00:06:25.380
If it makes sense you can test your solution.

102

00:06:25.560  -->  00:06:30.440
In this case it didn't make sense because it would basically give away the answer structure.

103

00:06:30.810  -->  00:06:35.160
But let's go ahead and check one that actually has a test cell for your solution.

104

00:06:35.250  -->  00:06:41.840
So we're going to have a go back here and we're going to go to the array section of the course.

105

00:06:41.910  -->  00:06:43.930
So here we're array sequences.

106

00:06:44.140  -->  00:06:49.560
Wrap Python for data algorithms they have struction interviews a click array sequences.

107

00:06:49.560  -->  00:06:55.920
Again I have notebooks to correspond to all the theory lectures and if I click here on array sequences

108

00:06:55.980  -->  00:06:59.470
interview questions I'll get to similar folders.

109

00:06:59.580  -->  00:07:04.950
The solutions and the question to themselves is good and clicked questions and here's the first one

110

00:07:05.820  -->  00:07:07.020
anagram check.

111

00:07:07.080  -->  00:07:14.750
So you're given the problem statements and you'll be asked to fill out your solution below.

112

00:07:14.760  -->  00:07:20.120
Just keep in mind you may get special notes or requirements on certain problems.

113

00:07:20.280  -->  00:07:22.290
You fill out your solution below.

114

00:07:22.290  -->  00:07:24.950
There may be examples of what it should look like.

115

00:07:25.050  -->  00:07:30.510
So for instance for this anagram Dogon God should say truth since those are anagrams.

116

00:07:30.510  -->  00:07:32.750
Clint Eastwood an old west action.

117

00:07:32.760  -->  00:07:35.260
These strings are also anagrams so they should be true.

118

00:07:35.550  -->  00:07:38.100
You'll learn more about this later on the sequence.

119

00:07:38.280  -->  00:07:42.610
Get what I want to get to here is there will be a test your solution section.

120

00:07:42.900  -->  00:07:49.440
So once you've actually filled out your solution here and this function you can run the cell to test

121

00:07:49.440  -->  00:07:50.470
your solution.

122

00:07:50.760  -->  00:07:52.810
I'll give you all test cases pass.

123

00:07:52.920  -->  00:07:58.350
That way you can test to see if your solution is working without having to jump to the entire solution

124

00:07:58.740  -->  00:08:02.460
and essentially cheating yourself of figuring it out on your own.

125

00:08:02.520  -->  00:08:03.100
All right.

126

00:08:03.450  -->  00:08:07.790
So if we go back and check out what the solution looks like let's go back one more.

127

00:08:07.830  -->  00:08:11.010
We can click on the solutions folder.

128

00:08:11.010  -->  00:08:13.110
Click anagram check solution.

129

00:08:13.190  -->  00:08:17.070
So the solution is pretty much always in all caps just to make sure you don't accidentally click on

130

00:08:17.070  -->  00:08:18.490
solution ever.

131

00:08:18.510  -->  00:08:19.940
Here we have the anagram solution.

132

00:08:19.960  -->  00:08:24.240
You'll have the same problem statement but you'll notice there's some explanation as to what we do in

133

00:08:24.240  -->  00:08:25.510
the solution.

134

00:08:25.620  -->  00:08:27.320
And then there's also code for it.

135

00:08:27.360  -->  00:08:32.360
I'll go ahead and hide that real quickly since you will have to do this interview problem later on.

136

00:08:32.670  -->  00:08:34.390
We'll go ahead and go back.

137

00:08:34.680  -->  00:08:35.580
So a quick note.

138

00:08:35.580  -->  00:08:38.640
We always go over the entire solution and the video lecture.

139

00:08:38.700  -->  00:08:43.050
So in case you don't understand the notebook explanation I will explain it line by line in the video

140

00:08:43.050  -->  00:08:44.220
solution lecture.

141

00:08:44.220  -->  00:08:47.190
So just keep that in mind.

142

00:08:47.190  -->  00:08:49.140
All right so one quick note.

143

00:08:49.200  -->  00:08:56.850
Going back to this interview notebook and the problem note book I really want to make sure you guys

144

00:08:56.850  -->  00:09:00.810
all understand how to run and test your solutions.

145

00:09:00.870  -->  00:09:02.700
So now let's look in the next lecture.

146

00:09:02.700  -->  00:09:07.790
What we're actually going to be doing is creating our own example interview notebook.

147

00:09:07.830  -->  00:09:08.590
All right.

148

00:09:08.820  -->  00:09:10.320
So I'll see the next lecture.

149

00:09:10.350  -->  00:09:12.570
We're going to create an example interview notebook.

150

00:09:12.680  -->  00:09:17.070
This this next lectures optional but I do recommend you check it out so you fully understand how to

151

00:09:17.070  -->  00:09:18.960
use these interview notebooks.

152

00:09:18.960  -->  00:09:19.620
All right.

153

00:09:19.890  -->  00:09:21.750
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
