Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview problem.

2

00:00:03.980  -->  00:00:06.370
So it's called sentence reversal.

3

00:00:06.540  -->  00:00:10.090
So given a string of words reverse all the words.

4

00:00:10.110  -->  00:00:12.590
So for example this is the best.

5

00:00:12.690  -->  00:00:14.460
You want to return best.

6

00:00:14.520  -->  00:00:17.740
Is this as part of the exercise.

7

00:00:17.790  -->  00:00:24.210
You should also remove all leading and trailing whitespace so the inputs such as space space space and

8

00:00:24.220  -->  00:00:32.190
then the words space here and the words space here and then several whitespace both become clear space

9

00:00:32.190  -->  00:00:32.800
.

10

00:00:32.940  -->  00:00:38.830
So notice that even if there's leading whitespace or trailing whitespace they should both be reverse

11

00:00:38.850  -->  00:00:40.510
and have the same output.

12

00:00:40.590  -->  00:00:42.510
So keep that in mind.

13

00:00:42.510  -->  00:00:44.430
Fill out your solution below.

14

00:00:44.670  -->  00:00:49.610
Take note of the examples and when you're ready to test your solution you can run this test so.

15

00:00:50.040  -->  00:00:50.710
All right.

16

00:00:50.940  -->  00:00:51.810
That's it.

17

00:00:51.810  -->  00:00:55.170
Best of luck on sentence reversal and I'll see the next lecture.

18

00:00:55.170  -->  00:00:57.690
Thanks everyone.
