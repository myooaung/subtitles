Hello everyone and welcome to just a quick solution on the implement a length list interview problem

2

00:00:06.900  -->  00:00:06.930
.

3

00:00:06.930  -->  00:00:11.730
As I mentioned the previous lecture it's a really common interview problem just at the beginning three

4

00:00:11.790  -->  00:00:14.780
to implement a singly linked list and a doubly linked list.

5

00:00:15.150  -->  00:00:17.050
You can go out and check out the solution.

6

00:00:17.100  -->  00:00:20.750
It's just the exact same note codes as we've used before.

7

00:00:20.760  -->  00:00:25.440
The main difference between the doubly and the singly is that the doubly linked list as you can recall

8

00:00:25.440  -->  00:00:31.050
from the lecture can refer to the previous node while the singly linked list only refers to the next

9

00:00:31.050  -->  00:00:32.150
node.

10

00:00:32.940  -->  00:00:38.190
Again I won't bother coding these out because by this time you should be a total pro at this and be

11

00:00:38.190  -->  00:00:40.190
able to program these for your eyes closed.

12

00:00:40.200  -->  00:00:45.510
Essentially if you still have any confusion on them go ahead and check out the full implementation lectures

13

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:50.910
as well as the theory lectures for all the details on implementing a linked list of a singly linked

14

00:00:50.910  -->  00:00:52.890
list and a doubly linked list.

15

00:00:52.890  -->  00:00:53.670
OK.

16

00:00:53.880  -->  00:00:55.860
Well that's it for the linked lists section.

17

00:00:55.860  -->  00:00:57.180
Hope you enjoyed it.

18

00:00:57.180  -->  00:01:01.650
Up next it's going to be recursion and we'll learn how to use recursion to solve a variety of problems

19

00:01:01.670  -->  00:01:01.850
.

20

00:01:02.010  -->  00:01:04.710
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next section
