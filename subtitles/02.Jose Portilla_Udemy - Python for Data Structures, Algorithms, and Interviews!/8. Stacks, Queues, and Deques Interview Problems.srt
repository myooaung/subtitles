Hello everyone and welcome to the stacks queues and deques interview problems section of this course

2

00:00:06,840  -->  00:00:10,150
before we began the actual interview problems and solutions.

3

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:14,710
Let me just give you a quick reminder of where you can find both the interview that books and the solution

4

00:00:14,710  -->  00:00:15,840
notebooks.

5

00:00:15,840  -->  00:00:18,590
Let's go ahead and jump to the NBA very early.

6

00:00:19,260  -->  00:00:24,300
So here at the NBA viewers link you'll see the stacks queues next section of the course.

7

00:00:24,330  -->  00:00:30,340
You can go ahead and click here for interview problems that will load up two folders stacks.

8

00:00:30,340  -->  00:00:34,050
His next interview questions and then the solutions folder.

9

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:38,640
So if you go ahead and click on the interview questions you'll notice that some of the questions are

10

00:00:38,640  -->  00:00:45,180
just implement a deck cue and stack those are actually in the first three questions we face that's just

11

00:00:45,180  -->  00:00:51,450
going to be implementing a deck and a Q and A stack just exactly what that line is.

12

00:00:51,510  -->  00:00:53,780
So we'll go ahead and cover those and a little more detail.

13

00:00:53,970  -->  00:00:59,040
But there's two other questions that are more typical interview problem questions not just the simple

14

00:00:59,040  -->  00:01:00,450
implementation.

15

00:01:00,450  -->  00:01:01,100
All right.

16

00:01:01,330  -->  00:01:05,150
Well that being said let's go ahead and start of the three problems.

17

00:01:05,250  -->  00:01:06,390
I'll see at the next lecture
