Hello everyone and welcome just to the last pair of questions as far as the length list interview problem

2

00:00:06.630  -->  00:00:08.040
section goes.

3

00:00:08.040  -->  00:00:15.390
In this case what I want to do is just finally implement a singly linked list and implement a doubly

4

00:00:15.390  -->  00:00:17.340
linked list.

5

00:00:17.340  -->  00:00:18.990
Again just for this interview problem.

6

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:24.180
All you have to do is fill in this class note as we've done and use it to create a singly linked list

7

00:00:24.180  -->  00:00:24.570
.

8

00:00:24.810  -->  00:00:29.600
Then add what you need to add in order to create a doubly linked list.

9

00:00:29.610  -->  00:00:34.290
There's no test for this solution because that would basically give away the answer structure for both

10

00:00:34.290  -->  00:00:35.290
of these.

11

00:00:35.310  -->  00:00:41.420
We do have implementation lectures so you can review those in case you need the answers.

12

00:00:41.430  -->  00:00:46.560
The main reason this is actually even an interview problem to begin with is because usually for the

13

00:00:46.590  -->  00:00:52.320
previous interview problems we've seen they may not give you the actual code for a single linked list

14

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:53.890
or just the nodes in general.

15

00:00:54.120  -->  00:00:59.220
So you have to implement the linked list yourself and then answer one of the questions that we previously

16

00:00:59.220  -->  00:00:59.930
asked.

17

00:00:59.940  -->  00:01:05.250
So it's always good to review and know how to build out the Node class for both a singly linked list

18

00:01:05.310  -->  00:01:06.770
and a doubly linked list.

19

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:09.500
Now the pros and cons of each and how they work.

20

00:01:09.630  -->  00:01:10.150
All right.

21

00:01:10.440  -->  00:01:11.450
But that being said.

22

00:01:11.610  -->  00:01:13.620
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
