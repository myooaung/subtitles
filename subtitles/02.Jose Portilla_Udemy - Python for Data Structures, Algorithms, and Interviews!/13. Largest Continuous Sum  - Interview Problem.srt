Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview problem.

2

00:00:04,260  -->  00:00:07,310
This one's called largest continuous sum.

3

00:00:07,440  -->  00:00:09,210
Here's the problem statement.

4

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:14,730
You're given an array of integers positive and negative integers and needed to find the largest continuous

5

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:15,350
sum.

6

00:00:15,630  -->  00:00:17,660
So fill out your solution below.

7

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:20,430
In its function.

8

00:00:20,430  -->  00:00:26,070
Something to note is that many times in an interview setting the question also requires you to report

9

00:00:26,070  -->  00:00:29,190
back the start and the points of the sum.

10

00:00:29,190  -->  00:00:32,450
Keep this in mind and see if you can solve that problem as well.

11

00:00:32,460  -->  00:00:35,620
We're going to see it in the mock interview section of the course later on.

12

00:00:36,000  -->  00:00:41,160
So you will run into this problem again with a little more detail and some different requirements for

13

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:41,710
you.

14

00:00:41,790  -->  00:00:47,430
But in this case all you're required to do in this situation is just find the largest continuous sum

15

00:00:47,430  -->  00:00:48,070
.

16

00:00:48,120  -->  00:00:52,640
So here we have put it in an array as a Python list in the large continuous some.

17

00:00:52,650  -->  00:00:55,230
Here is 29.

18

00:00:55,320  -->  00:00:55,720
All right.

19

00:00:55,980  -->  00:00:56,490
That's it.

20

00:00:56,490  -->  00:00:58,080
This is a little trickier than it might seem.

21

00:00:58,080  -->  00:00:59,330
So keep that in mind.

22

00:00:59,400  -->  00:01:02,280
You can run this cell here to test your solution.

23

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:04,170
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
