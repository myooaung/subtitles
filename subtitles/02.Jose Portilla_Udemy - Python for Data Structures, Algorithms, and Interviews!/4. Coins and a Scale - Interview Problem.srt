Hello everyone and welcome to your next riddle puzzle problem.

2

00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:07,370
Here's the problem statement.

3

00:00:07,500  -->  00:00:11,250
You have eight coins in a two pans scale.

4

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:17,790
All the coins weighed the same except for one of them which is heavier than all the others.

5

00:00:17,790  -->  00:00:20,940
The coins are otherwise indistinguishable.

6

00:00:20,940  -->  00:00:25,950
You can't make any assumptions about how much heavier the heavy coin is.

7

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:32,610
What is the minimum number of weighings on that scale needed to be certain of identifying the heavy

8

00:00:32,610  -->  00:00:33,810
coin.

9

00:00:34,520  -->  00:00:35,150
OK.

10

00:00:35,370  -->  00:00:36,290
Best of luck.

11

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:37,980
This is actually a really common puzzle.

12

00:00:37,990  -->  00:00:40,210
So you may have heard it before.

13

00:00:40,230  -->  00:00:40,590
All right.

14

00:00:40,650  -->  00:00:41,670
I'll see at the next lecture
