00:00:01.260  -->  00:00:05.910
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture where we're going to be discussing about questions you should

2

00:00:05.910  -->  00:00:08.980
ask after or during an interview.

3

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:13.960
So usually after an interview you'll be asked So do you have any questions for me.

4

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:19.260
They'll give you about five to 10 minutes depending on the company as a period of time where you can

5

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:23.820
ask them questions and remember you're interviewing the company just as much as they're interviewing

6

00:00:23.850  -->  00:00:28.050
you and you should always have questions to ask after an interview.

7

00:00:28.050  -->  00:00:31.340
You can ask them during their interview if it's more conversational.

8

00:00:31.410  -->  00:00:35.530
But usually there's a set time to ask it after the interview.

9

00:00:35.760  -->  00:00:39.830
So the next lecture contains a huge list of questions for you sorted by category.

10

00:00:40.010  -->  00:00:44.300
Well let's just discuss general concepts about asking these questions.

11

00:00:44.310  -->  00:00:49.380
So first we want to do is clarify your uncertainties so your first step should be to ask anything about

12

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:55.110
the position that had been covered during the interview though don't ask questions that you should already

13

00:00:55.110  -->  00:00:59.680
know the answers just by looking at the job description of the company website.

14

00:00:59.740  -->  00:01:04.600
So type questions would be what's typical day look like how will I be trained.

15

00:01:04.680  -->  00:01:07.680
What are the performance expectations over a certain period of time.

16

00:01:07.680  -->  00:01:10.320
Stuff like that.

17

00:01:10.590  -->  00:01:15.150
After that you're going to want to remove the doubts so ask questions that will allow you to talk about

18

00:01:15.210  -->  00:01:19.480
any strengths or accomplishments that you didn't get to cover during the interview.

19

00:01:19.620  -->  00:01:24.640
And then once they answer you can clarify or reiterate wire a good match for the position.

20

00:01:24.690  -->  00:01:29.770
So questions like that are what are the skills or experiences you're looking for in an ideal candidate

21

00:01:30.330  -->  00:01:35.110
something like what types of skills the team missing that you're looking to fill and you hire et cetera

22

00:01:35.250  -->  00:01:36.070
.

23

00:01:36.940  -->  00:01:40.720
Then then this is really important you want to uncover red flags.

24

00:01:40.770  -->  00:01:46.770
This can be tricky to do tactfully but asking questions about turnover culture and growth opportunities

25

00:01:46.770  -->  00:01:47.160
.

26

00:01:47.160  -->  00:01:51.640
During the interview process can really prevent unpleasant surprises down the road.

27

00:01:51.900  -->  00:01:57.840
And these type of questions are especially important for small startups so you can ask these questions

28

00:01:57.840  -->  00:02:01.560
in the forum such as what is company culture like.

29

00:02:01.600  -->  00:02:04.030
He told me about the team I'll be working with.

30

00:02:04.100  -->  00:02:07.240
Where's the last person who held this job moving onto.

31

00:02:07.290  -->  00:02:12.270
So you just want to be careful and really get a sense of what the company's truly like what company

32

00:02:12.270  -->  00:02:18.080
culture is like and you can go ahead and check out the next list next lecture and the list there.

33

00:02:18.230  -->  00:02:23.910
Oh we have plenty of questions that address the sort of concerns after that you want to get a view of

34

00:02:23.910  -->  00:02:24.940
the future.

35

00:02:25.050  -->  00:02:29.520
So asking questions about the growth of the company and its employees is a good idea for two reasons

36

00:02:29.520  -->  00:02:30.120
.

37

00:02:30.120  -->  00:02:35.400
First it gives a good perspective on what their values are and how you may or may not fit with the company

38

00:02:35.400  -->  00:02:36.270
.

39

00:02:36.270  -->  00:02:41.040
Secondly asking about the future of a company and the opportunity is there for your own growth shows

40

00:02:41.040  -->  00:02:46.760
that you're committed for the long haul and you're eager to learn the set of questions can be where

41

00:02:46.770  -->  00:02:48.920
do you see this company in the next few years.

42

00:02:49.050  -->  00:02:53.610
What training programs are available to your employees and what are the opportunities for advancement

43

00:02:53.610  -->  00:02:55.640
.

44

00:02:55.650  -->  00:02:56.320
All right.

45

00:02:56.430  -->  00:03:01.930
And then you may want to build a relationship so you can always fall back to ask in the interview about

46

00:03:01.930  -->  00:03:03.860
himself or herself.

47

00:03:03.870  -->  00:03:08.850
Remember don't get too personal and pay attention to how to interview her is reacting to your questions

48

00:03:08.850  -->  00:03:09.480
.

49

00:03:09.480  -->  00:03:12.660
So these type of questions can be like How long have you been at the company.

50

00:03:12.750  -->  00:03:17.520
What did you do before why did you choose this company and what's your favorite part about working here

51

00:03:17.520  -->  00:03:17.910
.

52

00:03:17.910  -->  00:03:22.880
Sometimes as far as red flags some people ask what's your least favorite part about working here.

53

00:03:22.960  -->  00:03:24.720
We're really gauge their reaction.

54

00:03:24.780  -->  00:03:28.260
So make sure it's an appropriate question to ask.

55

00:03:28.260  -->  00:03:29.150
All right.

56

00:03:29.190  -->  00:03:34.530
With that being done as far as wrapping it up at the end of the interview Don't forget to ask about

57

00:03:34.530  -->  00:03:35.410
next steps.

58

00:03:35.410  -->  00:03:39.710
So reiterate that you're interested in the position and you want to ask what are the next steps in the

59

00:03:39.790  -->  00:03:40.880
interview process.

60

00:03:40.890  -->  00:03:44.510
And is there anything else I can provide you with that would be helpful.

61

00:03:44.520  -->  00:03:46.920
So really wrap it up and close that deal.

62

00:03:47.560  -->  00:03:48.120
Okay.

63

00:03:48.270  -->  00:03:52.260
So look at the list in the next lecture and browse through the questions you may want to ask during

64

00:03:52.260  -->  00:03:56.780
an interview you have plenty of resources there and I encourage you to check them out.

65

00:03:56.790  -->  00:03:59.190
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
