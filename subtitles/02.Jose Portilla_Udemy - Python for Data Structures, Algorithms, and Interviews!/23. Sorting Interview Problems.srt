Hello everyone and welcome to the sorting and searching interview problems.

2

00:00:04,800  -->  00:00:09,540
So we've gone over the theory now let's talk about interview problems themselves.

3

00:00:09,540  -->  00:00:15,810
So in this section most common interview questions are related to sorting are just implementation questions

4

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:20,280
in this section you're actually just going to be asked to implement each of the sorting algorithms.

5

00:00:20,280  -->  00:00:26,070
We've already gone over then check the relevant implementation lecture for the solution.

6

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:29,550
So this section is going to be a little bit different than the other and to be a problem sections we've

7

00:00:29,550  -->  00:00:34,290
done where there is no direct solution video after the interview problem.

8

00:00:34,440  -->  00:00:38,980
Just go ahead and check the relevant implementation lecture for that algorithm.

9

00:00:39,000  -->  00:00:45,810
We'll go over this again individually for each of the interview problems the reminder that is a special

10

00:00:45,810  -->  00:00:48,160
no on the binary search algorithm.

11

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:52,440
This section's interview problems are just going to ask you to implement it.

12

00:00:52,560  -->  00:00:57,830
But keep in mind that future mock interview questions or it's the end of the Course will ask you questions

13

00:00:57,840  -->  00:01:01,480
we're using a binary search is critical to finding the answer.

14

00:01:01,920  -->  00:01:03,270
So really no binary search.

15

00:01:03,270  -->  00:01:06,190
Well but that being said.

16

00:01:06,240  -->  00:01:07,680
Best of luck on all the questions.

17

00:01:07,680  -->  00:01:12,420
Remember we're just going to be implementing the sorting algorithms the interview problems for this

18

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:14,010
section of the course.

19

00:01:14,060  -->  00:01:14,840
OK.

20

00:01:15,120  -->  00:01:16,740
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
