Hello everyone and welcome to the last interview problem for the sorting and searching section of this

2

00:00:05.940  -->  00:00:07.190
course.

00:00:07.950  -->  00:00:11.230
So for this problem I want you to implement a quick swords.

You can go ahead and check the implementation of a quick sort's lecture for the solution.

5

An explanation of the algorithm.

6

00:00:18.000  -->  00:00:22.070
OK that's it for the searching and sorting section of the course.

7

00:00:22.080  -->  00:00:26.400
Up next we're going to practice Riddell's how to approach riddles and brainteasers.
