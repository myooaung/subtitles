00:00:01,260  -->  00:00:07,680
Hello everyone and welcome to the array sequence section of this course and this lecture will be getting

2

00:00:07,680  -->  00:00:12,970
a brief overview of what the section is about and what to expect in this section.

3

00:00:12,960  -->  00:00:18,570
So in this section we'll get a brief introduction to array's that includes low level arrays and dynamic

4

00:00:18,570  -->  00:00:19,900
arrays.

5

00:00:19,980  -->  00:00:24,980
We'll learn about how arrays are constructed why they have the big old properties that they have.

6

00:00:25,620  -->  00:00:31,650
And we can think about that as the first section of this section of arrays so this section of the array

7

00:00:31,650  -->  00:00:37,220
sequences can be thought of as into portions one where we learn about on a computer science level how

8

00:00:37,220  -->  00:00:42,210
array sequences are built and then on the second part of it is going to be all the interview problems

9

00:00:42,210  -->  00:00:49,140
so we'll have a series of array based interview questions free to solve out on your own and we'll ease

10

00:00:49,140  -->  00:00:54,060
into this second half of the section with an array based mini project.

11

00:00:54,060  -->  00:01:00,030
We're going to build out based on a project our understanding of array sequences and how they work.

12

00:01:00,030  -->  00:01:07,080
So the first half will be mostly slide based and you'll be just looking mostly at notes the computer

13

00:01:07,080  -->  00:01:13,890
science decisions made that really build out arrays properties will do our mini project and then you'll

14

00:01:13,890  -->  00:01:19,080
start tackling actual interview questions presented to you in the Jupiter notebook format.

15

00:01:19,340  -->  00:01:19,890
OK.

16

00:01:20,340  -->  00:01:24,470
So let's go ahead and continue on just a brief introduction to arrays.

17

00:01:24,480  -->  00:01:30,960
Very brief on what we're actually talking about when we use the term arrays in Python array sequences

18

00:01:30,960  -->  00:01:36,860
in Python Sometimes you'll hear the term arrays and strings as Array sequences in Python.

19

00:01:36,870  -->  00:01:42,420
So that's because the term array or array sequence is pretty general across all languages and in Python

20

00:01:42,480  -->  00:01:46,860
We have three main sequence classes at least these are the three main ones we're going to focus on in

21

00:01:46,860  -->  00:01:47,890
this section.

22

00:01:48,060  -->  00:01:51,190
We have the list the tuple and the string.

23

00:01:51,600  -->  00:01:54,290
So all of these support indexing.

24

00:01:54,300  -->  00:02:00,080
So for example if I had any of these objects and index them and zero they would all return the elements

25

00:02:00,120  -->  00:02:01,420
1.

26

00:02:02,260  -->  00:02:02,940
OK.

27

00:02:03,210  -->  00:02:07,580
So again as I mentioned for the rest of this section we're going to focus on various aspects of arrays

28

00:02:07,580  -->  00:02:07,820
.

29

00:02:07,980  -->  00:02:13,920
How arrays are constructed is going to focus pretty heavily on computer science theory and then on the

30

00:02:13,920  -->  00:02:19,260
second half of this course we're going to see into the problems that are really having practical uses

31

00:02:19,260  -->  00:02:19,280
.

32

00:02:19,280  -->  00:02:26,280
So these are energy problems based off of arrays and your understanding all on the first half will help

33

00:02:26,280  -->  00:02:29,040
you tackle the problems on the second half.

34

00:02:29,040  -->  00:02:32,430
All right so with that being said let's go ahead and get started with the section
