00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,690
The Dependencies viewer tab inside of your IDE is a lot easier

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,840
way to add functionality to your project.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,510
So one of the tabs down below here is Dependencies,

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,240
if we click on it and select Add,

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,050
I can go to the search box here and just type in JUnit,

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,340
for example.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,620
Now one downside is you do have to know which version of

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,930
JUnit and which library you're looking for.

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,570
I happen to know that we do want the JUnit Jupyter engine,

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,480
but I can select that and click OK.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,540
Now if I click the pom.xml tab,

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,770
you'll see that it's added a dependency section inside of my pom,

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,540
and it has our artifact there.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:51,260
Likewise, I can go ahead and edit this, and hand key in a dependency.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,810
So let's just add another dependency inside of here.

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:01:03,550
We'll give it a groupId of org.springframework, and an artifactId of

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:11,040
spring‑core, and then we can give it a version.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,140
You're quickly seeing that this is a lot harder because I have to know all of

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:23,270
this information. So we can say 5.1.2.RELEASE, and I'll be totally honest

20
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,710
with you, I had to remember if it was .RELEASE, or .FINAL, or how their

21
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,430
naming conventions were to signify that this was the final version of this

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,240
code while I was doing this example.

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,610
So when I say this,

24
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,210
it'll go out and download any of those dependencies, but you can

25
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,670
see over in my Maven Dependencies section now that I have

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,440
spring‑core, spring‑jcl, junit‑jupyter, all of that stuff over

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,420
here in my Maven Dependencies section.

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,840
And if I switch back to my Dependencies tab,

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,530
they both show up there. Now one other really cool feature of this

30
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,910
is that I can select that JUnit dependency that we added, and click

31
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,130
Properties, and I can change the Scope.

32
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,240
So one of things I wanted to do was only have that available as test scope,

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,460
select test, and click.

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,460
OK. I don't have to go in there and remember the exact XML to have

35
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,440
that configured to only be visible during test.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,480
So it's a lot easier to manage those dependencies through that Dependencies tab,

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,020
especially if you're new to Maven, and adding those, and you don't

38
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:35,000
understand the XML very well, or you're trying to look at which version of that library you want to select.
