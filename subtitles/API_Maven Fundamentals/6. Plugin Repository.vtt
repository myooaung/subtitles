00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.650
Plugin repositories are almost identical to a dependency

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.650
repository, they just deal with plugins.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.020
We haven't covered plugins very much yet in this course,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.790
and that's actually the next module, but us far as where we go to look for them,

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.640
it's in a plugin repository.

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
We'll only look for plugins usually in a separate repository.

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.510
It doesn't have to be that way, it's just more of a code cleanliness

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.810
thing. They are defined very similar to repositories,

9
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.420
except that we have a different XML element that's

10
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.550
the pluginRepositories element.

11
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.590
As you can see here,

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.220
it's instead of just a plain Repositories element. The same rules apply that

13
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.490
we can have snapshots here, we can have releases here.

14
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.520
In this particular example, we did it for a fake corporation,

15
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.540
kind of like our own internal corporation.

16
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.520
Sometimes people will build their own plugins for things like

17
00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.000
versioning or how they handle releases or things like that, and put them in an internal corporate repository.
