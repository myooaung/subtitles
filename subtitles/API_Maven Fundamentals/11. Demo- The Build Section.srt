00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,470
To demonstrate how we can override the default naming convention of

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,900
our application, I'm going to go ahead and open up our pom.xml file

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,040
again, go into the build section,

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,940
and I'm going to override the final name of our application to foo.jar.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:29,140
So if I save this file, come out to our command line, and run mvn package,

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,740
it will go through and build our application,

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,070
and the final artifact will be named foo.jar. And you can see

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,760
that it already put that out in the output.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,310
But let's go ahead and navigate into our target directory. When I go into

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:49,200
target and do a DIR, you'll see that we have foo.jar here. Just so we

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,860
don't leave that out there as foo.jar, let's come in here and delete that

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,740
line back out and run it again.

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,060
You've got to be up at your project not down in the target

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:07,240
directory. And it'll build our application, and it will build

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,140
it with HelloWorld‑1.0‑SNAPSHOT.

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,490
Now I want to show you two things here.

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,450
If I cd back into our target directory and do a DIR again, because

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,150
I did not run clean, I have both foo.jar and

19
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,210
HelloWorld‑1.0‑SNAPSHOT.jar both in my target directory.

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,280
So if you're making changes like that,

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:39,040
you probably want to run a mvn clean and then a mvn package and have that

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,620
delete that target directory and recreate your application.

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:51,000
So now when we go back into target, we'll only have our HelloWorld‑1.0‑SNAPSHOT.jar.
