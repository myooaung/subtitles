00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.530
Hello.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.740
This is Brian Hansen with Pluralsight,

3
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.300
and this is my training course on Maven Fundamentals.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.120
In this course, we're going to cover a brief introduction to what Maven is.

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.770
This is applicable to whether you are new to Maven or you've

6
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.540
used various other build tools such as Ant.

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.770
We're going to do a detailed overview of the pros and cons between

8
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.470
build tools such as Ant or other scripting tools and what's different

9
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.430
about Maven. We'll cover the key concepts of Maven, concepts like

10
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.040
convention over configuration.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.200
And don't worry if you've never heard that term before.

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.800
This is the foundation for which Maven is built on,

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.970
and we're going to discuss what this means.

14
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.040
But in a nutshell.

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.540
If you follow their methodology, it makes your life a lot easier.

16
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.050
We're going to cover the day‑to‑day programming concepts and how to

17
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.340
integrate Maven into your typical code throughout the day.

18
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.630
We'll also cover basic integration as far as tying it into your IDE and how to

19
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.940
make it work well with other tools that you're already using.

20
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.180
You can use Maven as a standalone tool,

21
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.160
or you can use it inside of an IDE such as Eclipse,

22
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.800
Spring, or IntelliJ.

23
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.770
We're actually going to go through a step‑by‑step

24
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.050
instruction as to how to do that in your IDE and see how

25
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.740
that makes development a lot easier.

26
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.100
Maven can also be very complex.

27
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.180
It can do a lot of things for you such as

28
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.060
multi‑module builds and very sophisticated,

29
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.840
tough‑structured concepts, but it can also be very simple for you to use.

30
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.990
We're going to see if we can make this an easier tool for you to use in

31
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.560
your day‑to‑day coding. Topics we're going to cover, we're going to look

32
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.350
at what general introduction to Maven is,

33
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350
and then we're going to dive into the structure.

34
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.840
What folder structure does Maven like?

35
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.560
Well, there is a very basic structure that if you follow it,

36
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.030
everything just kind of works for you.

37
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.790
Then we're going to dive into dependencies.

38
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.850
If you use Maven for one thing,

39
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.950
it should be dependency management in handling transitive

40
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.540
dependencies inside your application.

41
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.750
Next, we're going to dive into repositories, why we want to use repositories,

42
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.680
what they are good for, and what your local repository is and how

43
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.640
that would also tie into your corporate repository.

44
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.000
Then we're going to look at plugins.

45
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.690
Every action you do inside of Maven is a plugin.

46
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.460
We don't need to write our own plugins,

47
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.440
but we'll talk about how you download and use other ones than

48
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.120
just the standard built‑in default ones and how to see what

49
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.240
plugins are available for you out there.

50
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.680
Then we're also going to spend some time,

51
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.750
as I mentioned earlier,

52
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.640
looking at the IDE integrations and how to tie that

53
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.000
into your builds within your IDE. Let's get started by diving into the fundamentals of Maven.
