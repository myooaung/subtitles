1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,940
Repositories are, very simply,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,040
just an HTTP‑accessible location that we can download files from.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,390
Very often they don't have any security wrapped around them,

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,840
although for your internal repository you can definitely add it.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:23,240
Our default location is defined in the file or the super pom.xml.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,130
We've mentioned this before previously. The Super POM is

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,240
located inside of our Maven installation.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,340
Generally, you don't need to go into it, the Super POM that is. In fact,

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,670
I'll go out on a limb and say you should never really edit the Super

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,230
POM because there's other ways to override it.

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,530
Either go through a global parent project file or

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,540
through your own project's pom.xml.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,240
So don't edit the one that comes with the default Maven installation.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,540
The default location that it's pointing to is repo.maven.apache.org.

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,340
This has 95% of what you'll ever want to download,

16
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,230
but it's that extra 5% that we're going to focus on now,

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,140
because it's actually a very important part.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,700
The Maven repo that's out there by default has all of the open source projects.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,840
You're never going to upload your company's internal resource

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,370
libraries to repo.maven.apache.org, because you probably don't

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,930
want other people using that. We should note that multiple

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,340
repositories are allowed and, in fact, often encouraged.

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,430
You'll have a case where you'll have to download

24
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,270
things from more than one repository,

25
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,200
and that's fine, it's a common practice. To do so, we

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,590
can use a corporate repository.

27
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,900
A corporate repository is definitely outside the scope of this course,

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,910
but you are encouraged to use one,

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,110
though. A few years ago when Maven was getting really popular,

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,810
nobody was using a corporate repo yet. Developers actually caused a

31
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,940
denial‑of‑service attack on the main repo.maven.apache.org site.

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,520
Two of the most common ones out there are Nexus, that's actually what's

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,600
backing repo.maven.apache.org, and there's another one that is almost used is

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,840
equally in some other projects called Artifactory.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,390
If I were starting from scratch,

36
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,210
I would probably tell you to look at the Nexus repository,

37
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,000
but Artifactory works well. I've used both on projects and been happy with both of them.
