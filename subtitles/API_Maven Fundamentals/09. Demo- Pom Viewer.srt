00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,390
The POM overview is the initial view that you

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,140
receive when you open up your pom.xml.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,860
I've opened this file up before,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,970
so it keeps wanting to go to the source code, but the first

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,650
time you've opened up an application,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,160
it's going to take you to this Overview screen where you can see the

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,470
Group Id and the Artifact Id and basic meta information.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,270
There are some other pieces of this. You can define project information,

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,670
you can define your source control if you have this tied to your build

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,100
process that it's editing some of those things.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,970
Most people don't use these other selections,

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,320
though. It is of note if you change this here, so let's say we take

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,350
this from com.pluralsight to com.training and click the pom.xml, it

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,550
will have changed our groupId here.

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,500
And likewise,

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,140
if we change this back to pluralsight and change back to our Overview,

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,400
it will have updated that there.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,250
So it's realâ€‘time live editing of those features for you to

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,000
go back and forth. Not super helpful, but it is nice if you don't like meddling inside of XML.
