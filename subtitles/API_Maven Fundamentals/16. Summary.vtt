00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.030
In this module we covered that the Maven integration

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.310
with IDEs is a very valuable thing,

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.550
and it can give us a lot of insight into what's

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.840
going on inside of our application.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.510
We also looked at the Eclipse and Spring STS installation and that

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.740
it's really just unzipping a bundled application.

7
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.100
Existing projects can be imported easily and converting

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.740
projects can be done easily, as well.

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.410
Adding dependencies inside the IDE is easier than doing it by hand,

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.710
because there some good searching tools.

11
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.410
Sometimes they don't work as well as we would like them to,

12
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.140
but they can make adding basic ones a lot easier.

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.030
Solving dependency resolution errors is a lot more

14
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.020
convenient inside the IDE as well,

15
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.360
we can look and see if something's being omitted or overridden. And also

16
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.160
configuring your IDE is just a lot more convenient with Maven on both of

17
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.610
the demos that we did. As soon as we imported it, it automatically

18
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.860
downloaded all those dependencies and added them to our class path and

19
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.840
then built all of our source.

20
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.940
It builds automatically based off of that configuration. So

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.000
there's no extra step to be done outside of your IDE or inside of your IDE to get it to work with Maven.
