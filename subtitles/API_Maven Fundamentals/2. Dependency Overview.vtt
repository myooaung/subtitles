00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.850
Dependencies are simply other resources that we want

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.310
to use inside of our application.

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.530
Maven will pull in transitive dependencies based off the

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.100
dependencies we list. To use a dependency, we simply just list

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.690
that dependency and Maven will automatically download it for us

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.340
and pull in the transitive dependencies.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.550
To use dependencies,

8
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.120
we have to have three things. We need to have a group ID. Group IDs

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.940
are typically the same as our package structure.

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.690
The next thing we need is the artifact ID. The artifact ID is these name

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.660
of the actual item that we want to use. And lastly,

12
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.540
we need a version.

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.740
Version is simply the version number, nothing more, nothing less.

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.630
We're going to cover versions in another slide here in a second because

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.940
there's one particular thing you need to know about versions.

16
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.200
But to add a basic dependency to our application,

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.140
we just need to add XML similar to this.

18
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.270
So, this entire dependencies section of our POM we have our dependencies

19
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.140
in here now called org.apache.commons, that's our groupId, our

20
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.990
artifactId is commonsâ€‘lang3, and then our version is 3.8.1. Now, this

21
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.910
example I chose on purpose because, historically, Apache didn't follow

22
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.000
the standard naming conventions, but they have since adapted what the industry used and dictated.
