00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,500
The Source Plugin can often be confusing to people because they think it's

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,640
doing more than what it actually does for our application.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,860
All it does is package up our source code for us so that we can

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,930
distribute it for context‑sensitive help inside of our IDE or to

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,070
make some more code‑intensive javadocs.

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,430
It's, by default,

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,070
also tied to the package phase just like we saw with the JAR Plugin, and

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,740
it's frequently even overridden to a later phase than that.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,590
If you're running package a lot and you don't want to sit there and wait for it,

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,810
people will just tie it to the install phase or even the deploy

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,640
phase just because it's slowing their build down.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,720
If you remember the verify phase,

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,050
it's run right before the install and deploy phase. We're going

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,070
to walk through an example of altering this plugin to tie it to

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:57,000
a later phase, and in an upcoming demo, we'll do the same thing with the Javadoc Plugin.
