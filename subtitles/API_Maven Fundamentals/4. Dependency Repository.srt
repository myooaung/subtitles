1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,830
A dependency repository is exactly what it sounds like, it's

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,370
where we download all of our dependencies from. It can contain

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,240
releases or snapshots or both, for that matter,

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,440
but it's not uncommon to have them in separate repositories.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,740
It's very easy for us to define our dependency repository.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,880
It's just a snippet of XML in the repository section of our POM.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,540
Here is an example of that code.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,940
It has to have an id, and in this example,

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,980
we're using spring‑snapshot, and generally we want to give it a name,

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,940
although it's not required.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,860
But just so it's more descriptive we'll use Spring Maven SNAPSHOT

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,780
Repository for our example, and then the URL to our repository.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,660
Now usually organizations are pretty good about labeling

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,580
their repository as a snapshot repository,

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,240
and you can see on the end of this URL here, libs‑snapshot.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,650
You'll also notice that in this one we have snapshots

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,640
enabled to true and releases enabled to false.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,700
If we were going to enable people to download both

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,940
snapshots and releases from this repository,

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,850
that would just say releases enabled true, pretty straightforward.

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,420
Like I said,

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,570
you can have multiple repos and it would be another element inside the

23
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,480
repository's element to just define a separate one for releases versus

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,000
snapshots. Let's take a look at a demo of how we can download an artifact from that repository.
