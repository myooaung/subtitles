1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,770
The entire next module is dedicated towards dependencies,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,430
but we can't talk about our POM and not spend at least a

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,050
minute or two walking through how dependencies work in the

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,900
bigger picture of our POM.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,070
Dependencies are imported by their naming convention.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,560
This is often considered the most confusing part of Maven,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,580
because you have to know what their artifactId is,

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,040
what their groupId is, and what version you want to use.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,780
The nice thing about this, though,

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,570
is that it will pull transit dependencies in for us.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,030
Like I said, we're going to go into this in greater detail in the next module,

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,030
but adding a dependency to our POM is fairly simple.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,680
We just add it in the dependency section of our POM,

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,760
and we just need to list what dependency that we want to use,

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,340
and any transitive dependencies will automatically be pulled in for us,

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,140
We need to know our three things, our groupId,

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,790
our artifactId, and our version.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,440
Let's look what this code looks like for us to achieve this.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,610
The pom.xml that we just looked at a minute ago now has a dependency

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,180
section in it and a dependency listed inside of that.

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,800
You can see that we're pulling in the org.apache.commons

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,940
groupId and the commons‑lang version 3,

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,440
and specifically a specified version of 3.8.1.

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,980
It's pretty straightforward,

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,250
and you don't see that there's transitive

26
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,720
dependencies on the commons‑lang module,

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,440
so it will just download this file and any supporting libraries that it needs.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,960
This is all you have to do to add a dependency inside of our section,

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,900
but notice it's the same naming convention of our project

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:54,000
that it is for our dependencies: groupId, artifactId, and version.
