00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,930
By default, Maven looks for a src/main/java directory underneath our

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,570
project. It compiles all of our code to a target directory, and then

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,020
it does all this by referencing our defaults and whatever things we've

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,340
overridden in our pom.xml file.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,050
If you look at the image of our Hello World application on

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,800
the left that we did in our earlier module,

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,050
you can see this basic folder structure in place right now.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,120
Our project name was HelloWorld, subsequently that's also our

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,320
artifactId. We're going to talk about that more in a minute.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,590
We can also see the src/main/java directory where our HelloWorld.java

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,590
file is located at, the target directory and our POM file as well.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:54,000
Notice the level at which these are too, src, target, and pom file are all at the top level of our application.
