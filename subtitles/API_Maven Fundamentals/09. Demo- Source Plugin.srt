1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,480
To configure the Source Plugin, we're going to just go down in our

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,830
plugin section again and add another plugin.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,440
We're going to add this plugin here.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,080
It's another one from org.apache.maven.plugins.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,110
It's the <artifactId>maven‑source‑plugin. The version is 3.1.0, and then

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,230
the execution section is where it gets interesting.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,630
As I mentioned before, we were going to tie this to a later phase.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,300
And so we went ahead and added an execution section and a

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,370
specific execution inside of there that's tied to the

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,670
<goal>jar and the <phase>install.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,840
So this is one of the latest phases that we could tie it to.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,670
Now I'm going to go ahead and open up our command

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,760
line again and do a mvn install, and it will go through,

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,560
download anything it needs to, compile the source code,

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,260
and then it will build out the jar and the sources.jar to our target directory.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,140
So if we cd to target and do a dir,

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,330
you'll see that we now have two jar files in here.

18
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,380
We have our sources.jar and our artifact that we're trying to create.

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,080
So it went ahead and created that and pushed it to a later

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:29,000
phase inside of our build lifecycle, and this is what it looked like to configure that.
