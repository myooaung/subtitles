1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,230
If we look at the POM for our sample project right now,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,440
it's really quite simple.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,000
We open it up to a full screen, it barely takes up the entire full screen.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,580
In fact, it only does because I'm on such a high resolution.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,140
We've got our three dependencies and our build section that defines which

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,640
Compiler Plugin we're going to use for a specific version.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,210
But if you look at the bottom of the screen here, we have the Effective POM tab.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,590
If I click on it, you'll notice that it is quite wordy.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,340
It's very lengthy,

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,950
and at first it looks very similar to what our POM is that we

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,730
have to find just inside of our application.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,040
We got our model, group, artifact, and version information,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,510
then our dependency section, but as you scroll down,

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,810
you'll notice that we also have a repository section,

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,040
and this is inheriting from these super POM.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,480
So it is pulling this information in from the super POM that

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,040
comes with the Maven installation that we have.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,590
You can see that we have the main repository for

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,580
Central Repo defined inside of here.

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,880
You'll also notice that on line 30 through 32,

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,190
that it has snapshots disabled by default.

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,770
Same thing iif you scroll down to the PluginRepository section,

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,250
you can see that we're also going against the Central Repo for

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,230
that, and it has snapshots also disabled for that,

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,540
and it won't try and force any updates.

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,960
There is also, inside of our build section,

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,360
the defaults for our source directory, test source directory,

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,530
that type of information, where are outputs go. It has all

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,940
of our information built inside of here.

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,550
You'll also see that there's plugins defined inside of here for us.

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,210
So the release‑plugin, the dependency‑plugin, the assembly‑plugin,

32
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,480
and you can see specific versions inside of here.

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,030
So this is everything that's being built inside of your application.

34
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,470
Now you can override all of this just by editing your own POM,

35
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,840
you don't have to go into the super POM at all,

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,620
but this is what's configured for you by default. You can

37
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,580
see our Compiler Plugin, how it adds that in line to the

38
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,280
plugin section that we have.

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,400
But then you can see where our test‑plugin's configured at, and how

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,080
all of that's all ran, and the clean‑plugin, all of that information

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,240
is pulled inside of our application.

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,790
We have the install‑plugin for all of those goals.

43
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,270
We have the deploy‑plugin for the deploy goal and the

44
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,590
deploy phase, the site information.

45
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,530
All of this stuff is built out for you and inherited from that

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,190
super POM, and if we were using a parent POM,

47
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,460
it would pull that information in as well.

48
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,120
So really wordy,

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,040
a lot of stuff going on, but if you're really trying to trouble shoot something,

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,460
don't look past the Effective POM tab because chances are you

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,160
can find a version of what you're looking for,

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,000
or something that you might want to override, or just know how something's working, and it's defined inside of this file.
