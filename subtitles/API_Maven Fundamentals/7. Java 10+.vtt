00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.930
We're going to jump ahead a little bit. Since I mentioned earlier

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.380
this is an update to the original course, to use Java 10 or later in

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.190
your IDE, or just for general development,

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.540
we have to add a build section and a plugin.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.280
If we don't add this here,

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.270
you would have an error in your IDE as we just saw on the command

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.340
line for all the exercises that we're going to do going forward.

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.280
All we do is add a build section,

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.180
followed by a plugins section, and then add the

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.000
maven‑compiler‑plugin and specify a release. Let's add this to our code now.
