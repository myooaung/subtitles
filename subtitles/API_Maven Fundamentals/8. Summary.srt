1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,680
Dependency repositories and plugin repositories can be separate or the

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,900
same repository. As we mentioned, projects will often not upload their

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,300
snapshot code to central because of the headaches and sometimes

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,930
frequent changes that their code will go through before they get it up

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,740
to a final released project.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,680
Plugins are usually in the same repository as dependencies,

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,160
but can be broken out.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,290
They often are broken out for corporate repositories,

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,140
and if you've created your own plugin, should store it there.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,260
Also, as I mentioned,

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,560
companies should look at using their own corporate repository to

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,460
help lighten the load on the central repo.

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,990
You're eventually going to build your own libraries that

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,000
you want to have hosted internally and not be posting those up to the central repository.
