00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:08.250
Are right now we are looking at the expenses worksheet Now a couple of bigger assumptions is for the

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.400
programs that we have right.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.580
We have a certain number of instructors for course and tutors.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.280
So we may assume that hey for the full time bootcamps we're going to two instructors per course and

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.290
two additional tutors for the part time bootcamps may just have one instructor and two tutors downline

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.920
courses have one instructor and one tutor.

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.370
Now the other assumption that we're going to make around the space is that we're we're actually paying

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.730
rent.

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.240
Right.

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.550
So for the rent we may have common which is common in commercial leases.

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.610
Some sort of a rent pump that happens every two years or every three years.

12
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.880
So we're going to model that out as well when we do the modeling.

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.030
A lot of times it's easy to put the assumptions at the top or on the side of where you're working with.

14
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.440
So in the expenses I'm going to put them in the expenses but the expense assumptions there and the revenue

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.570
assumptions we put the revenue assumptions on that page it makes it easier to manage because we've put

16
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.890
Sometimes you can put all the assumptions on the same page as well.

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
So it's really up to preference and we're going to show you models that kind of do both.

18
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.830
One of the other models here the the indoor golf lounge model we pretty much have all the assumptions

19
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.530
on one page so you can kind of visualize it all together and there are some advantages to that.

20
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.480
But for these ones we're just putting them in the correct area.

21
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.280
And then the corresponding worksheets.

22
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.630
It's really more of a personal preference.

23
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.110
All right.

24
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200
So for the expenses What do we do.

25
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
Well you always want to start with timing related things.

26
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.380
Okay.

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.200
So here we have the timing which was done already in the revenue worksheet so we're just kind of copying

28
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.170
it and pulling from there.

29
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.380
Right.

30
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.410
We're pulling from the revenue timelines so all the timing is the same.

31
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.820
Now then remember we had the costs at these different times of startup costs rent from here.

32
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.070
We had all of these start up costs and then we assign them these timings while we're adding them up

33
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.000
here just into the correct buckets.

34
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.520
And then what we're doing is look at the how many months each of those are and then we're spacing that

35
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.120
spend in the correct timing in the correct month evenly.

36
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.930
So if there was this much spin over the three month of permitting which was the first three months of

37
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.550
perming then it gets divided even like that.

38
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.530
And then for construction for there for launch it falls into the correct spot as well right there for

39
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.820
three months and then for that throughout it's just expenses that are happening throughout the early

40
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.250
parts pre-launch for the project.

41
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.150
And that's where it is.

42
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.210
So then when you add it all up you have your total startup spend.

43
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.060
So your starter spend doesn't all happen on day one.

44
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.400
Right.

45
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.220
So you're going to be spending over some period as you develop and build out your business.

46
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.860
And so that's what this allows you to do is to space out your startup spend correctly.

47
00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.360
Next thing we can think about here is headcount you know for this business model we may have some senior

48
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.940
managers director of marketing that does all the marketing someone who is a facilities manager and make

49
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.570
sure all the lights are working and everything's you know doing all the repairs or any kind of upkeep.

50
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.900
So mighty folk.

51
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.890
Lot of receptionists assistants with the tea and maybe some interns.

52
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.480
So this is something that we've done before and where we model Hey how many of these headcount are we

53
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.360
starting with what month are we starting that count and how many are we adding and at what frequency

54
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.160
do we add them.

55
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.670
And then what is the most.

56
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.870
What is the max headcount we can have for each category.

57
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.770
So based on that we have these numbers here that tells us what the headcount is for each category over

58
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.340
time.

59
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.660
In any given month.

60
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.180
What's the headcount we can do the same with the salary rates right.

61
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.530
What are they starting at one month starting.

62
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.970
Because it doesn't make sense to pay people for that role.

63
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.350
Before we have somebody in that role so we're starting in the same month as when we're starting to do

64
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.970
the headcount.

65
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.900
Maybe we can do some sort of raise at some different intervals and there's some sort of a max salary

66
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.930
or Max compensation for each of these.

67
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.920
And then we calculate what that is.

68
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.290
Now the two things that are a little bit different here is how we do the calculations for instructors

69
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.200
and tutors.

70
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.490
The reason for that is we don't want to just decide for that is we want this to depend on the number

71
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.060
of courses.

72
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.380
Right because we're going to have two instructors or one instructor per course and then a certain number

73
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.940
of tutors per course.

74
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.270
So this should depend on the number of courses that we have.

75
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:39.210
So the way we're doing that is we're taking the some product of a number of instructors times the number

76
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.680
of courses that we have.

77
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.910
That was on right here.

78
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.780
The course can do in any given month.

79
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.770
We're taking the course count and then we're multiplying it by the number of instructors number of part

80
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.490
time you know tutors for each of them and then so then what we can calculate then is how many total

81
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.360
instructors we.

82
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.430
And then how many total tutors that we have.

83
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.400
So now that we have the total counts like that and we can do the same with the salaries that when we

84
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.480
don't have to be very special we can tell what the starting salaries are with the max salaries are right.

85
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.400
So then from that we have the counts and the compensation for each of them we can calculate the total

86
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.260
compensation for each category and then calculate the total compensation overall.

87
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.390
And then once we did that we still got to address the rent issue right.

88
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.020
So here this is where the rent bump is where we did the 5 percent growing every 24 months.

89
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.490
So when you do rent bumps you start off with 100 percent because if you don't have a bump then you want

90
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.020
to take 100 percent of the rent.

91
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.730
But once you have the bump you're taking more than 100 percent of the rent.

92
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.920
Right.

93
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.900
So this is more than 24 months later.

94
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.550
Now whatever your rental rate was if you got that 5 percent back.

95
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.000
So that's what that was there for.

96
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.410
Next thing is to look at the other related expenses and we're going to have two categories we're going

97
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.060
to have some that are cost per person per month.

98
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.790
And then we have some other cost per month categories.

99
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.980
Technically this legal one should be here for a retainer.

100
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.920
But we did it this way in the other examples so we left that here for familiarity.

101
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.920
You could actually just remove that and put it over here.

102
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.300
And the model would work exactly the same.

103
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.620
So now these expenses again depend on the number of headcount.

104
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.830
Right.

105
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.450
So the bigger the headcount in terms of people that are working the higher the number here.

106
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.890
But these here are going to be just other monthly expenses.

107
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.800
You may be paying like some fixed rate on some telecom or other expenses.

108
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.640
So that's one could think of too much.

109
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.560
But you know the space is here for you to do that so you can have that out there.

110
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.690
Finally though we have some costs that are related to the sales rent.

111
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.210
So for in our case we had some acquisition costs based on acquisition assumptions we can just to calculate

112
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.610
the total acquisition cost by multiplying the number of students who were there were acquired for them

113
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.170
of times the acquisition costs.

114
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.220
But then we have all of the relevant expenses calculated.
