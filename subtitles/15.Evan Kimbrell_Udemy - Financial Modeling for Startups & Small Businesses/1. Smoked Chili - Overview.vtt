00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.090
You guys will come back to the course.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:08.290
In this case study we're going to look at another brick and mortar business specifically a restaurant

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.570
start up and we're going to look at modeling out a single restaurant location in a lot of detail for

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.350
a smoked pepper Mexican fast food restaurant.

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.910
They're going to serve burrito in taco salads.

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.380
But anyways if you're new to the restaurant business and industry itself there's three broad categories

7
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.430
for restaurants classifications.

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.430
At least we have the quick service.

9
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.610
These are like the fast food chains the McDonald's the Burger King the in and out.

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.330
And then we have the fast casual tier.

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.230
So these are sort of still fast but it's a little bit Price year.

12
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.320
The menus a little bit more elevated at least in terms of ingredients a little bit more costly.

13
00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.390
So it's not your winter schnitzels it's more of your Panda Express it's more of your pay ways or your

14
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.310
P.F. Chang's.

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.780
Then the third category is the full service sit down restaurants.

16
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.320
These are like your steakhouses.

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.570
These are the ones where you have somebody taking you to your table and then taking your orders and

18
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330
bringing you water bring you bread.

19
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.540
Basically full service from the beginning to the end.

20
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.590
This case study that restaurant we're going to do is going to be in the fast casual segment.

21
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.620
What are we going to look at in this case.

22
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.770
Well even though we're just going to look at the first location of a restaurant if you're doing restaurant

23
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.070
start up you got to start one.

24
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.410
There's a lot of things that you can model out and you can project and help you figure out what your

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.720
startup sonar is going to be like for this rush from things like your startup expenses and start up

26
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.290
costs but really factoring the ramp up period during the grand opening the restaurant don't achieve

27
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.270
their stabilizer for revenue rate until a certain time in the future.

28
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.100
And you are also going to have to think about your menu mix your pricing your day parts.

29
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.430
When are you going to be opening or are you going to be doing breakfast lunch and dinner or are just

30
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.500
two of the deep parts and looking at things like Libor deployment how many associates you deployed during

31
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.480
certain parts of the day is going to determine how much your labor costs are going to be.

32
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.030
So when we get all of those things in the context of opening and starting up a restaurant business let's

33
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.220
go.
