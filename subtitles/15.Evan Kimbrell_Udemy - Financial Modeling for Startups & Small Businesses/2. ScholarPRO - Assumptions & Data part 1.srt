1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,690
You will come back to the course.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:12,180
OK so we're going to go over these Ghaleb rule financial projections Excel that we built about five

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,840
years ago for raising our second round of capital.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,060
We're going to do this a little bit differently than the with Simon did it.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:25,420
Simon was taking blank Excel sheets and then building them up to get to a certain destination.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:33,600
This is too complex to do that they would require way too much time diving into how we came up with

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,080
all of the information we did and the dynamics of the industry and pretty much all the nuances of our

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,860
sales channels.

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,990
So instead we're going to want to look at it backwards and show you what we had and kind of talked through

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,470
what we did well what did not work and try to put you kind of in our heads.

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,140
Back when we were putting this together so attached to the lecture it's either a lecture this lecture

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,610
or you can download this and follow along.

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,380
Some people might ask is it OK to be shelling this and yes I mean it was confidential but the company

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,430
ended up not making it.

15
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,950
I don't actually know why and I talked to that last lecture because I was not there.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,860
But since it's defunct now this is no longer confidential so we're going to dive right into it.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:28,290
OK so in the set of lectures Coming up we're going to first just focus on each individual tab and they'll

18
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,540
be kind of grouped together in each lecture.

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,320
So at first we'll talk about this one and then we'll talk about this and this will move all the way

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,500
down and that's pretty much how we'll cover it.

21
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,450
All right so this is the assumptions and data panel.

22
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:48,090
Another way that we set up our financial model was such that we had all of the kind of basic things

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,820
you would expect to see in a startup financial model such as you're trying to raise money.

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:00,300
We had our we were going to use our funds for this raise what we expected our monthly income to look

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,090
like.

26
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,000
We look the expected our yearly income to look like.

27
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,480
There are graphs and charts and those graphs and charts.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,330
Then we got what's called a simple revenue which is just a very quick snapshot view of showing your

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,150
revenue because not every single person wants to jump in and look at every single detail of your revenue

30
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,660
every single type of sale and location on sale and then you look at the expenses and everything like

31
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:24,970
that.

32
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,180
So this is just a very good snapshot.

33
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,020
And then we had scenarios and scenarios are just a way to kind of hedge.

34
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:41,280
Oftentimes you'll be working with investors and they have a very three set kind of view of what your

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,680
industry should look like what your business should look like financially and they just have a lot of

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,730
built in assumptions and this is kind of unavoidable and so what we try to do is address at least two

37
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,340
common scenarios that could happen.

38
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,060
We didn't want to make a model that just showed the most rosy possible picture assuming everything went

39
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,020
right.

40
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,930
We just picked kind of two out of a hat really that we thought people might bring up.

41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,700
And so far I mean it's a pretty effective strategy.

42
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,040
It does really kind of lower how much back and forth you have to have with investors because they'll

43
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,930
think in their head well what happens if you miss a deadline like this one.

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,350
And then they find out oh right it's just at the back.

45
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,870
This is actually a good strategy as well for pitch decks.

46
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,460
If you use pitch decks it's great to put in the very end.

47
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,110
Responses are rebuttals to common questions.

48
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,910
OK so we'll get into that a little bit later.

49
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,080
What I want to show you first is our assumptions and data sheet.

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,800
So the way that this model works is by using pivot tables now pivot tables you'd probably maybe you

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,760
don't know what these are.

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,900
Maybe you do.

53
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,970
I personally think they are the best thing ever in financial models.

54
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,440
And I will tell you why.

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:02,970
So with a pivot table works is you essentially set up all of these different types of variables in one

56
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:09,990
sheet and then you set it up such that they can either manually input in the numbers for each assumption

57
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,910
or they can toggle and pick something that is likely.

58
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,660
See like right here we have this dropdown where they can pick some type of scenario.

59
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:27,050
And what ends up happening is every single sheet on here pulls their information from this sheet.

60
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,750
OK.

61
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,510
Number one it's really helpful to set aside all of your variables and assumptions right here earlier

62
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,190
than one s.c you can see them all isolated.

63
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,320
So when someone can just read through these and see if they agree a lot of this stuff is subjective

64
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,680
how do I know if paying your CEO $60000 a year is competitive given the competitive landscape right

65
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,380
now.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,140
We don't know.

67
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,500
Someone might have an opinion saying it's too much and some people might think it's too little.

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:01,080
So by doing this by setting up in this way when someone looks at this like an investor they I can put

69
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,770
in whatever they want.

70
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,560
I mean one of the biggest problems of financial modeling early is pitching financial models to investors

71
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,320
is you have to use because you have to just pick one scenario you're going to say yeah we're going to

72
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,720
sign on 10000 users in this amount of time it's going to take us this much money and everything else

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,060
is going to look like this.

74
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,080
And then immediately you get someone who is a pessimist or an optimist and they'll say you're selling

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,940
yourself short or they really might just go after certain parts of what you're trying to say.

76
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,050
And unfortunately there you are you're stuck with the model that they hate and it's you can't really

77
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,680
mess with it.

78
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,770
So with this we just set it up so that the investor or whoever is looking at it can fill it out the

79
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,360
way that they feel like.

80
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,710
Again financial models.

81
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,240
The whole point of this exercise is to show that we understand our business and understand our industry.

82
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,380
So it doesn't actually really matter if these variables change that much.

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,830
We just have to show that we understand the way that they work together and show that no matter how

84
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,640
you screw with this unless you go crazy with it we still have good fundamentals and we still have a

85
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,680
good shot at profitability.

86
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:07,930
OK.

87
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,910
There's only one thing you remember from this entire financial hot hole course.

88
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,510
Pivot tables they're great.

89
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,540
Let other people pick what they feel comfortable with and then make everything kind of flow from that.

90
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,960
So let's just start from the top left.

91
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,490
If you guys remember Sellar Perot was an application we used it to help people apply for scholarships

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,510
there was like a common application for scholarships and we use schools as a primary kind of growth

93
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,990
channel because they liked it.

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,740
One of the students they use it said there's some symbiosis there.

95
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,190
And so they would promote it directly their students but the student then would pay.

96
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,920
So what we had up here was revenue assumptions right.

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,140
So we still had the business model of the student paying.

98
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:53,310
So we would put our variable here for the price we were saying twenty five dollars a year this was actually

99
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,080
before we decided to change the system and go with a monthly one which actually makes a lot more sense

100
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,550
than a yearly one because we originally were thinking oh you apply to scholarships once a year.

101
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,130
Therefore we want to lock you into a yearly subscription and you pay for it at the very beginning of

102
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,010
the scholarships season.

103
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,800
And then at the end you still have it and then you want to renew again.

104
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:20,160
So we were worried that with the monthly people would end up essentially churning or leaving right after

105
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,400
they're done applying and then not picking it up till eight months later.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,610
But in reality we could actually charged a lot more if we did monthly.

107
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,840
So that was our mistake.

108
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,050
The next thing we have is penetration rate and this was just an assumption that some people will think

109
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,380
is too high and some people think is too low.

110
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,200
What it basically means is that when a university emails out are out to their students what do we think

111
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,580
that the actual rate of sign ups will be.

112
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:46,940
Right.

113
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,740
So they can read the e-mail a hundred people.

114
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,420
How many people do you think will actually sign up.

115
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,630
Now there's multiple ways of getting to this.

116
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,240
This number right here.

117
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,530
You can use baseline judgment.

118
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:04,890
You can look at other things and base it offer that you can look at basic SAS subscription kind of sign

119
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:12,060
ups if you wanted to kind of go for a low end and those are sent out an e-mail about any random SAS

120
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,560
tool.

121
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,930
Maybe 5 percent of an email list on average will end up converting if you guys want to learn more about

122
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,880
that going to bear metrics dot com that's actually where you can see a lot of benchmarks of systems

123
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,000
for industries and their Sign-Up metrics.

124
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,170
But for us we actually came at it from a different angle.

125
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:40,590
So what we did is we ran a simulation over here we have the Miami-Dade test which is the details here.

126
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,750
I don't know why we had that but what happened here is so we really had no idea how many people would

127
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,200
sign up.

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,420
We really didn't know how happy the schools would be with the program in general.

129
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:59,910
So we went to a school and did a small test within a subset of the school so Miami Dade is school network

130
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,630
in Miami.

131
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,950
And I think Miami Dade is like the kind of they have like an honors school and it's just not nearly

132
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,930
as many people in it.

133
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,480
But what we did is we kind of negotiated a deal.

134
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,350
So they would promote it to their students.

135
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,420
And I think we gave them like a reduced rate or something like that in order for us to then use these

136
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,960
statistics to then inform our financial model and to kind of figure out how likely it was that we could

137
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
raise money.

138
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,540
And how popular it was in general.

139
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:36,360
So what happened here was that see we saw roughly 20 percent of people would actually pull out a credit

140
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,440
card and pay us.

141
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,940
And so I think it was out of 500 people.

142
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,110
Yes if 500 people were the test 233 clicked through so presumably the other ones maybe maybe they don't.

143
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,780
We're not looking for scholarships not something that applies to them.

144
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,170
And then these ones were serious enough to do it.

145
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,770
So in order to be kind of reasonable about this and this was a very hand-selected group of people we

146
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,890
looked for honors it was like an honors college.

147
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,900
A lot of people would transfer into larger colleges that costs more kind of just cut that in half.

148
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,950
And I think that's where we got the ten point thirty.

149
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,720
That's generally a good way of doing it.

150
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,810
Take a number you.

151
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,540
You feel confident about are comparable.

152
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,330
And then just make it harder.

153
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:13,630
Right.

154
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,970
So when someone looks at that they can see that you're hedging right.

155
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,210
And then and if you can still show that this works even in a worst case scenario that's a lot better

156
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:28,880
situation than showing the same number you got and then apply it to everything and then having someone

157
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,250
kind of call you out on it.

158
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,080
But regardless we set it up here so you could change it right.

159
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,680
So if you wanted to change this to ten point ten point nine we could.

160
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:44,030
And if you wanted to look through the system you would see all the numbers are changing.

161
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,680
The next thing we wanted to kind of build an assumption around was the number of schools promoting scholar

162
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,760
pro year.

163
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,590
Now this is a bit of a kind of a Genki calculation here.

164
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,030
The idea again we got to find schools and not promote our system.

165
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,430
So we did a lot of tests.

166
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:08,180
You know we do a lot of cold emails cold calls and we kind of just summarized how easy it was to get

167
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,490
in contact with people at schools who could send these e-mails out.

168
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,130
And we kind of figured out how long it would take and how many hours it would take because we did this

169
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,480
with about a 20 to 30 schools.

170
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,700
We had a pretty decent idea how long it would take someone.

171
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,200
So we kind of just assumed well if it takes this amount of time and we had someone at first it seemed

172
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,050
dedicated to it and then someone eventually dedicated to it.

173
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,910
Then we kind of just extrapolated this number and the way that we got this is down here.

174
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,080
We had sales assumptions so we assumed that.

175
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,120
I think the starting point was in the three salespeople all the time we made this thing we only had

176
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,650
one.

177
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,130
But then it goes yeah.

178
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,030
So our calculation was they could do 33 in a year.

179
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:57,410
So at 33 and then we kind of assume that over time how many would we be able to add on that.

180
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,770
Regardless this time this equals this.

181
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,630
And that's how we figured it out three people first year probably at 100.

182
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:08,940
Now the next assumption is OK well if you add a 100 schools how big are they.

183
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,160
Because you can have a college that is like my college was 7300 people Doubs in college but you can

184
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,900
also have colleges that are gigantic.

185
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,620
I mean 13000 actually is not even that large.

186
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,090
There's some public university systems that are over 100000 So that's a really big variation.

187
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,310
Right.

188
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,900
A hundred tiny colleges or 100 mega colleges.

189
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,870
We don't really know.

190
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Well we did know though is that working with big schools took much longer working with smaller ones

191
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,090
did not take nearly as long.

192
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,390
But you know that was a calculation we try to do later to try to figure out per hour you spent on it.

193
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,170
Which one was more valuable actually into being the bigger schools because bureaucracy is bureaucracy

194
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,150
regardless of how large the school is.

195
00:12:53,150 --> 00:13:02,270
So what we did here was we wanted to show different ways of visualizing the revenue growth based on

196
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,590
how you break down that hundred schools.

197
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,860
We don't really know how to show this so we just kind of said like why don't you get a bunch of scenarios

198
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:16,370
right so one scenario might be more small schools one might be more medium or much more larger schools

199
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,330
and an equal mix.

200
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,000
And so you can kind of see over here we're showing Let me qualify it as a small schools of the 10000

201
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,030
a medium 10 or 30 and anything over 30 is large.

202
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,090
And again we just kind of did this to set up the investors to gas whatever they wanted.

203
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,770
I mean they might think that this appeals more to medium schools or small schools or they might think

204
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,430
it's only larger schools whatever.

205
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:41,510
What you will see though is that when you pick larger revenue growth or revenue in general it goes up

206
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,800
quite a bit.

207
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,990
And if you go down here it goes down quite a bit.

208
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,640
So really it's going to be up to them.

209
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,010
But the reason why we did it like this and give them scenarios was because generally someone who's looking

210
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,870
at this is not sophisticated enough to know that.

211
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,410
Well guess so schools are different sizes.

212
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,550
And then I would say well I know exactly you're going to get 90 small and 10 medium or whatever.

213
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,900
I mean they can literally change it if they want to.

214
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,910
We just wanted to make it as simple as possible and also kind of guide them in the direction we thought

215
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,700
was reasonable and also made us look good.

216
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,840
They could actually if they wanted to change it or here and if you can look at these these calculations

217
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,400
these are actually really quite simple to set up really all this sad was.

218
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:28,890
So if J.J. is scenario so the scenario says more small schools then set this at 25.

219
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,760
If it says more medium schools than set this one here at Bhooter is ze six.

220
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,270
So think it's like 35.

221
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,130
And then if it's equal Maxton set at Z A.

222
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,300
Or is it.

223
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,280
OK here we are it's over.

224
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,590
So it's pulling it over here.

225
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,920
Right.

226
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,320
And so these would be the acquisition breakdowns and a quick reference but it just pulling it over here

227
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,730
and that's how we got that number over here.

228
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,510
It's actually relatively simple.

229
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,420
And then what we have right here is an assumption that maybe we lists of whether the big schools or

230
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:07,630
small schools maybe we just have a flat rate of how many mega schools we can add because there are not

231
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:14,110
that many big hundred K plus enrollment schools and you ask there's like 20 or 30 but we didn't really

232
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,320
want to bake that into this because this is only kind of like a one time thing.

233
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,060
It's really time intensive for these ones.

234
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,150
And again we really just didn't know how much bandwidth we'd have to add more of these schools.

235
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,090
So we put that one right here so this just gets added to the whole pie right now in here we put subscription

236
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:36,090
renewal rate if SAS company looked at this and they're like wow only 30 percent of people were read

237
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,520
up after a year they'd say that's terrible.

238
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,010
Like 70 percent churn is terrible.

239
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,020
But in our situation yeah.

240
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:48,190
I mean it doesn't really make sense that you're going have 90 percent retention if the whole idea is

241
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,520
that you apply for scholarships.

242
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:55,450
So you either get them and leave the system or you age out of it like you go to college or you go to

243
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,430
grad school and you don't need it anymore.

244
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,800
Or a million other reasons you didn't like it.

245
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,420
So we just had a lot of things working against us in terms of our subscription rate problem.

246
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,360
You could make an argument that we probably should have gone with the subscription rate.

247
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,100
I would not try to argue with that.

248
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,940
I guess we're going to cover just a little bit more and then I'll see you in the next lecture we'll

249
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,250
we'll round out this assumption table.

250
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,630
This is actually where the majority of the explanation is.

251
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,590
This is really where a lot of the work and thinking kind of was put into this.

252
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:29,410
The last thing I will kind of cover over here is we kind of just put some basic assumptions over here

253
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,250
to let people kind of toggle them as they feel appropriate.

254
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,850
So direct cost assumptions like credit card processing fee 2.1 five.

255
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,990
I don't know who charges 2.1 five anymore.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,270
It's usually over 30 percent.

257
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:47,410
Even Squire I think is above this but we can just set it so that Gerri whatever you know we run into

258
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:53,290
investors you are convinced that your processing is going to be 6 percent and then other ones just couldn't

259
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,340
care less.

260
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,510
So we set this up so they can change it for whatever they feel like.

261
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,980
Then we put this which is cost to acquire a school.

262
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,080
So we just assume that we'd have like a direct cost associated with getting schools.

263
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:10,500
And it really was a catch all a lot of times you just know there's other expenses involved you're going

264
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,920
to want to map it out.

265
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,540
You don't understand it well enough.

266
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:20,740
So you just kind of gave this blanket it was like we had a budget for collateral design flights kind

267
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,890
of things that are associated with making a sale.

268
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,450
It didn't necessarily I don't think it applied to their salaries the salesman salaries might.

269
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,070
But that's a general kind of a technique you'll see where we don't know it.

270
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,900
We don't really know if it's terribly important if we break this down all the way and every single part

271
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,370
that you pay for every parking ticket you get parking to go talk to their financial aid office or whatever.

272
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:52,040
So we just got to use a blanket and this is just contingency like you saw Simon do several times but.

273
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,340
Yeah.

274
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,220
And so again you can let anyone change this to their heart's pleasure by saying we've put subscriber

275
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,750
maintenance subscription.

276
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:04,600
So again if I'm using an application as a SAS tool it doesn't really cost us anything to keep you on

277
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,370
the system how ever it will cost time and money to have customer support and maintenance.

278
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,120
So something breaks and they want to talk to support.

279
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,870
Well you know that's labor.

280
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,170
Right.

281
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:22,960
So we just figured well we have some direct cost assumptions let's just assume per month per user the

282
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,870
use of something like $2 right because in general maybe 5 percent of people you support and all the

283
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,730
other ones don't.

284
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,060
And so those five pretty much all your costs but then we spread it across you get something like this

285
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,710
again.

286
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,820
People can change it as they see fit.

287
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,610
OK guys soon as we're getting around a little bit long on this lecture I will catch up in the next lecture

288
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,590
and we'll kind of round this out and then start moving on into the individual models and graphs.

289
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,070
Okay.

290
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,480
See that.
