00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,760
Hey guys welcome back to the course this lecture.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,700
We're going to introduce you to a basic marketing concept that you can use as a very useful lens for

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,950
understanding your financial models.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,880
This lecture we're going to talk about the concept of funnels Yes funnels like you funnel something

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,210
into your mouth or you funnel money out of your ex-husband or wife's business that's called embezzlement.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,380
But with regards to financial models what exactly am I talking about.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,410
Well same isn't any marketing campaign.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,740
We generally like to think of our progress or more specifically our acquisition of users or customers

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,320
in distinct phases.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,080
Marketers generally delineate this process into phases because it allows them to see which areas need

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,600
focus.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,440
And it's kind of measuring stick for their progress specifically.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,330
Let's say I'm marketing a Web site and I go and run some ads.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,290
How do I measure how effective that ad campaign is.

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,040
Slash was well you would have to look at a number of things.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,150
First you'd have to look at the number of people that saw your and then the number clicked then the

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,310
number that stayed on your page and didn't immediately leave what we called Bounce.

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,730
Then the ones that maybe put say an item in their cart and then finally by the number that end up purchasing

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,900
something from you.

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,410
So marketers will even go farther and track who for instance than refers others to buy from you if you

21
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,660
guys are in my growth market or class you'll probably remember that one because the number in each phase

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,200
progressively gets smaller and smaller.

23
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,020
Remember anything past that first phase of seeing the ad is is obviously going to be a subset of people

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,520
that saw the ad and moved on to the next phase because each section is a subset.

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,570
You could display this process in the shape of a funnel something probably like this.

26
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,940
If you guys Google marketing funnel you'll see just hundreds of these lots of people go in the top often

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,300
called Top funnel by hip marketers and the people that make it all the way through the end are the absolute

28
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,310
number that buy from you sign up or whatever your conversion goal is.

29
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,550
We call that area down the funnel Obviously now with a lot of different disciplines we can gain a certain

30
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,160
level of insight by cross-pollinating these concepts.

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,700
Financial modeling really is no different in that regard if you can take manufacturing concepts like

32
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:33,930
economies of scale or even economics concepts like price sensitivity or even concepts from sales such

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,430
as price leverage.

34
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,270
Then you could certainly borrow the concepts of funneling and thinking about things through the paradigm

35
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,820
of a funnel from marketing disciplines.

36
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,530
And we strongly suggest you do so.

37
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:54,150
In fact I find it really useful when you model to constantly ask yourself could I think of this like

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,200
a funnel.

39
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,230
In most cases the most useful way of applying this concept is to user acquisition it's obvious it's

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,030
the most obvious way of doing it.

41
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,950
You have to pay money either directly or indirectly to get customers.

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,870
So it's probably worth knowing which of your efforts to get them is the most effective and what their

43
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,820
respective funnels look like.

44
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,890
So let's say we run Twitter.

45
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,480
Yes.

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:25,510
That big blue bloated bird that makes us Jack Dorsey and who are the other guy is biz plan guy.

47
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,780
How do we look at users and a basic funnel if we were looking at Twitter.

48
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Well it would be similar to that e-commerce example but a little bit different.

49
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,570
They are obviously a social network and they don't actually sell you anything yet.

50
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,210
So remember that part in their case well they might track the number of people that saw an ad or say

51
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,660
a sponsorship or a news story.

52
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,840
Then the number that went to Twitter the number that didn't immediately leave or bounce and then say

53
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,370
like the number that clicked sign up but abandoned then we could say maybe the number that finally signed

54
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:09,480
up OK but since the application has a lot more depth than that we might want to go farther and incorporate

55
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,460
more user behaviors into our funnel.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,570
So after that we might track say the number of users that completely fill out their profile.

57
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,950
Then we could say the number of users that add 20 followers for Twitter that's a really big metric for

58
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,430
them.

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,290
Then we can do that number of users that send their first tweet.

60
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,770
We can even go and then track them in a linear fashion by how often they come back to the app every

61
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,280
day every week every month whatever.

62
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,740
This in Twitter's case would be helpful because we're essentially tracking who ends up using the system

63
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,670
the most.

64
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:50,520
They make their money off advertisements and so the more someone clicks refresh and the more pages they

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,890
view the more ads they're displayed and theoretically more the more money that Twitter makes.

66
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,040
If I were actually modeling Twitter I would probably make a separate.

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,370
In my excel sheet that tracked this process I could then pull in like what percentage of my new users

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:12,640
got to a certain point in the funnel and even what the cost per user getting to that specific point

69
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,670
in the fall was not a fun concept is really helpful because it's a way of imagining what appears to

70
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:25,930
be a flurry of customer behaviors and it puts them into this linear and logical step by step by step

71
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,830
process.

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,070
If you acquire your customers or even just have a landing page that people sign up through you'll probably

73
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:40,480
want to track this with some sort of a funnel like design in a model a basic funnel could look as simple

74
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,210
as this in the first column you could mark off the stage in your process.

75
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,880
Then next to it Mark the total number of users that made it to that part.

76
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,510
You can then add percentages if you want one thing that's common is to calculate the percentage decrease

77
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,710
from each step to the next.

78
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,800
That is obviously incredibly useful because you might see a 90 percent drop off of one spot and a 5

79
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,440
percent drop off somewhere else.

80
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,930
Guess where are you going to point your attention towards.

81
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:14,170
So when you put together the model for whatever your business may be ask yourself how do I get my customers

82
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,200
would it be helpful to understand and visualize that acquisition process.

83
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,280
And then last.

84
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,100
Is there actually any other part of my business that I could visualize in a similar way if I ship out

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,200
a physical product.

86
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:35,440
For instance how many break after a week how many break after two weeks how many get returned to me.

87
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,800
That is also a funnel that you could use.

88
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,900
So try to think in terms of funnels if it applies and not only helps you better visualize your process

89
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:49,370
but it can give you key insights on how to improve and debug your process as it stands.

90
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,840
Not sure what your funnel might look like.

91
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,860
Well actually just google it.

92
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,580
I'm not even joking if you just Google your industry your type of business.

93
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,120
Plus funnel you can you actually see a lot of different examples.

94
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,530
It'll either give you inspiration to make your own or you'll find the exact same model that you need.

95
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,380
We can't honestly cover funnels for every single industry but they're usually pretty simple protip don't

96
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,380
search this specific business.

97
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:25,630
Don't say pet rock enthusiast subscription model search for subscription business model or funnels for

98
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,370
subscription business the fact factors like pet rocks is nothing to do with it.

99
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,030
OK guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
