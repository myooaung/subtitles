00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,330
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,750
I'm sorry I have to break this to you but when it comes to the process of modeling there is no such

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,580
thing as perfection.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,890
You're going to make mistakes.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,800
It's going to happen but you don't have to sweat too much about it.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,980
It's not about preventing as much as it is about being able to catch them.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,430
So you can fix them.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,290
You don't want to realize that you made a silly error in your modeling after you've sent it with your

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,000
pitch decks and your projections out to potential investors.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,010
So when it comes to hers there are two main types of errors that I want you to be aware of.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,570
One is a logical error.

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,410
And the other is a technical error a logical error would be the equivalent of thinking you can sell

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,150
600 lemonade cups in an hour.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,350
It's totally wrong but Excel or any other spreadsheet program is going to let you build it and it won't

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,620
make any complaints.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,360
All the calculations would still calculate.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,220
So for these types of errors we do what are called sanity checks.

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,270
You pause and ask yourself Is this really possible.

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,150
Selling 600 cups in an hour.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,580
Reasonable.

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,060
Let's see that means I have to sell 10 cups per minute or a cup every six seconds.

22
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,510
Not a chance in hell especially from one lemonade stand in one location.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,950
So we can do sanity checks before and after we create our models.

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,190
I prefer to do them beforehand so it sets the stage for what is reasonable.

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,450
So I know what range I need to be in to be in the ballpark of reality.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,640
Now technical errors are a little different.

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,090
There are the errors that you make in the process of modeling these are putting in the wrong formulas.

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,910
Linking to the wrong cells.

29
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:58,700
This is the equivalent of forgetting to put a semi-colon in your C++ senior project.

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,150
And if you don't hear a coder you know what I mean.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,010
Luckily for you it's really easy to do error checking in Excel.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,920
Here's how we might do simple airchecks in her lemonade stand model.

33
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,420
So this was the sanity check that we did before we started building the model.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,450
Right and this is not something that Excel can tell you whether you're right or wrong you're going to

35
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,070
have to check against yourself.

36
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,070
Can you actually sell three cups per minute.

37
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,870
Maybe not.

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,200
Right.

39
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,450
And that's where we might have set some more realistic expectations of maybe selling half a cup every

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,380
minute.

41
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,870
So this is the sanity check.

42
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,330
Now what do we do with error checking in the models.

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:48,120
So with error checking it's looking at opportunities within your model to see if what the calculations

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,570
are for certain values is what you would expect and some of the easiest places for those opportunities

45
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:00,020
are when you're pulling in or aggregating values from multiple sources.

46
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,360
So in our multiple locations we have a lot of opportunities we could check traffic numbers we could

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,460
check purchases we could check pretty much any of these summary lines against what we would expect.

48
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:11,700
Right.

49
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,550
So let's take a look at the gross revenue number if I want to check to make sure this whole line is

50
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,520
correct.

51
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:18,930
Okay.

52
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:28,830
So one way I can do that is I'm going to compare that to say the sum of all the gross revenue.

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:37,880
I'm just going to actually pull some of the gross revenues for each of these locations

54
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,000
so on the surface they look this same or close to being the same.

55
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,830
They look different.

56
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,440
Right.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,500
I'll tell you why it's different in minute in the way you want to compare them than I can write something

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,190
simple with an if statement I can say if this all of that which is the sum of all the gross revenues

59
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,560
is equal to this gross revenue that I calculated in a different way.

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,180
If it's the same give me empty quotes or give me a blank.

61
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:20,820
I don't want to see anything if it's correct and don't show anything but if it's not correct.

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,450
Give me an error now because it's a message you have put it in quotes as a string or a text.

63
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,000
In this this formula here it's Close's.

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,380
Now there's an error.

65
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,310
So it shows up and if I copy this formula all the way across I can visually see if there are any other

66
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,530
errors here.

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,180
Now there's no other errors.

68
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,590
Let me see what's going on here in this area.

69
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,190
Well when I look at the formula like hey there's a extra plus one here.

70
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,260
What the hell's going on then I can fix the formula.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
And now the error is gone.

72
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,030
So building these kinds of error checks adding an extra line and adding formulas to check each of these

73
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,470
can tell you if you messed up something right.

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:12,150
So I can do this for all of the other items and check and if any of the errors show then you can pinpoint

75
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,790
where the error is coming from and then fix it.

76
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,350
So where and when you do sanity checks and error checks.

77
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:26,340
Well you do sanity checks of all your key assumptions and outputs is the foot traffic figure reasonable

78
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,080
on a Saturday afternoon is the number of cups I need to sell reasonable.

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,360
Now you do error checking of any intermediate and final results or calculations in your models.

80
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,730
This helps you pinpoint any errors you make.

81
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,760
If you only check at the very end and you have a very long and complicated model it can be really hard

82
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:51,480
for you to go all the way back to finding where that error is by checking out when something is Hauffe.

83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,070
It's a lot easier to find out.
