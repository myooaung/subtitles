00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.690
All right.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.370
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.010
We looked at the updated revenue for the you works model in the previous lecture.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.380
Right.

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.950
And now let's look at the expenses.

6
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.750
So for the expenses we're going to start off with looking at the timing.

7
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.410
Okay.

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.740
Now the timing here to calculate the start up costs.

9
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.230
So we had a closing which is to designate that it's basically cost that happened right away in the first

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.190
month and then then we have a permanent period and then we have the construction and all of that right.

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.740
So then these expenses that we put in in the startup right here we sum it up by the correct categories.

12
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.820
Here's all the startup costs.

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.810
Then we have it spaced out based on the timing that we did here.

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.010
So if it's closing the total expense happens in that first month permitting we have three months spread

15
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.370
out over three months construction.

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.650
We said it was nine months.

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.010
So then it spreads out over the next nine months.

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.580
And then there's a two month launch and that's how much we're spending during the launch than that.

19
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.130
And then this is a start up expense throughout the period that is before being active.

20
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.090
So then we have the spend here.

21
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.460
Okay.

22
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.440
So then we sum it up in any given column then we have the total startup spend for that month and we

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.610
see that it will go up to a point right until it becomes active.

24
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.520
We have no more start to spend.

25
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.720
Now this part should be familiar for you.

26
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.070
Right.

27
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.480
We did the headcount and then we did the compensation for the head count and then we calculated the

28
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.020
total compensation here.

29
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.830
So that's pretty straightforward.

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.730
Then there are some other expenses here and pretty much it looks the same.

31
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.940
The only thing we added that's different here from what you've done was the addition of these other

32
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.280
per month costs.

33
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.930
Okay.

34
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.530
So these happen are based on headcount right.

35
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.280
Except for the legal retainer.

36
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.920
This actually should fall into here but we're going to assume that that starts right away.

37
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.880
So that's OK to put up there and leave it there but for some of these other maybe per month expenses

38
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.570
you know maybe you're have some ongoing monthly marketing budget you're paying for snacks maybe speakers

39
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.680
or some utilities and other things that you really aren't paying for until you actually are opened for

40
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.820
business.

41
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.280
So those we have some money we spend.

42
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.760
But we need to designate which month it starts.

43
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.140
So that's the difference here.

44
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.360
And then these expenses we're going to assume everything grows at this kind of growth rate.

45
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.950
So we're going to apply that to all of the expenses as well so it starts in the correct month of that

46
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.550
amount.

47
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.390
But because it's starting in the 15 month it already had that 3 percent bump.

48
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.960
Okay.

49
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.650
To the expenses.

50
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.060
That's good practice is you know regardless of when it's kicking in if you're starting some initial

51
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.910
amount even if it kicks in later you don't start at that amount.

52
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.000
You start at the amount that it should have increased to by then.

53
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.610
Okay.

54
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.380
So then when we have that then we can calculate all of the other monthly expenses.

55
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.320
And so this one now one of the things to do is once you build that structure for he can calculate headcount

56
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.680
in compensation you can reuse it.

57
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.940
And that's why you don't need to kind of build all the parts and brand new around here.

58
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.740
This is pretty much exactly the same as up here except you know it's not based on headcount and we added

59
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.410
this component to it.

60
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.580
So a lot of building financial models is utilizing what you've built.

61
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.660
You get lising what you can find in what you have and you have quite a few options.

62
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.000
Now by taking this course pulling the pieces that are close to what you're trying to do and then adapting

63
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.970
it to your needs.

64
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.010
So next there let's see how it all comes together.
