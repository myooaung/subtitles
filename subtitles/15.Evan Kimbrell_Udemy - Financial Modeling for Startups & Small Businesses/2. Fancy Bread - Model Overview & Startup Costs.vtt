00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.310
Hey welcome back to the course we are looking at the fancy bread motto here.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.670
So first thing here is just a quick brainstorm of some of the key components of the model we want to

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.970
address right first.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.520
This is a subscription model.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.500
The customers are choosing one of three plans that they're paying on a monthly basis at these rates.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.980
And there are some restrictions.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
You know the first plan is a lot cheaper but they can only get 10 hours a month.

8
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.580
And the second plan is $99 but they get only 40 hours a month and then the final plan $300 a month.

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.250
They get unlimited number of hours per month.

10
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.960
There is a cap of max of 60 per location and then they can also bring guests the Creator in the luminary

11
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.820
the two higher tiers they get a certain number of free hours five and twenty before they have to pay

12
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.560
the $6 per hour for the guests rate for the Explorer.

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.100
There's no free hours now in terms of costs.

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.260
Every time a customer goes to a co-working space we've got to assume that they're going to pay that

15
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.090
co-working office some costs per hour for the customer that's there right.

16
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.500
And then also some other key costs are going to be around acquisition cost is going to cost some money

17
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.680
to convince people to buy into these plans.

18
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.060
Right.

19
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.780
But also it's going to cost the company time and resources money to actually sign on these co-working

20
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.060
offices as partners.

21
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.650
Somebody's got to call them somebody's got to educate them and convince them and sell them on the idea

22
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.200
of being part of the fancy bread network.

23
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.390
So that's going to cost some money.

24
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.350
And obviously we're also going to have some overhead.

25
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.380
Right so these were kind of the major big components we've got to address in the model.

26
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.680
And before we get into the revenue and expenses let's take a look at what the startup costs might look

27
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.000
like.

28
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.480
Right.

29
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.340
So for something like this it's more of an app right.

30
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.990
Like in service you know they're really co-founders or whoever's working on this team they've got to

31
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.100
really just build this app and they need to sign on these initial partners in co-working spaces.

32
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.610
They may launch in just one city or maybe just a couple of cities and you know for them their biggest

33
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.390
startup costs is going to be around having the resources so that they can build it and ramp up and then

34
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.770
do the initial marketing.

35
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.600
So let's say maybe initially they're just working out of a new work small office.

36
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.020
Okay.

37
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.360
And then they are also hiring some other freelance developers.

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.820
They have some living expenses just to co-founders you know they want to set aside some initial marketing

39
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.690
budget for their launch.

40
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.320
They're doing some special testing when they're launched in beta just to see which features are better

41
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.620
just to see you know they're doing ABC testing so they're using some tools that's going to help them

42
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.630
do that more efficiently and more effectively.

43
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.950
And being smart.

44
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.010
They are also going to make sure they have a little bit of contingency during the startup.

45
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.680
Right now the startup costs are calculated to be under 140000 but they're going to ask for 400000 just

46
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.660
because with the way the assumptions are going to be built right now which you're going to see in the

47
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.020
next coming lectures they do need a lot more capital to ramp up because when they launch they're going

48
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.520
to be spending more than they're earning initially and that's where they're going to need that working

49
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.320
capital in order to get to the point where they break even.

50
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.780
OK.

51
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.470
Now these startup expenses we got to think about when it happens.

52
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.660
Right.

53
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.510
So how long it happens it may be the fact that they are going to go in development for six months and

54
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.100
go into beta and fine tune over another three months and then they're going to do a bigger launch for

55
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.480
another three months.

56
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.870
Okay so if we look at that as a first 12 months and we split all this up in those 12 months we're going

57
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.790
to be able to model out that initial startup cash flow based on these assumptions.

58
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.520
Okay.

59
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.030
So in the next lecture we're going to look at the revenue side first based on these this subscription

60
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.470
business model on the pricing how might we model out the revenue we're going to take a look at that

61
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.100
next.
