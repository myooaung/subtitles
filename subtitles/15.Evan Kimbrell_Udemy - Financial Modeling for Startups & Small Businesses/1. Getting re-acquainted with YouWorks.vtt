00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.900
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.830
So in this case study.

3
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.530
We're going to finally reconnect you to our long lost case study the coworking space.

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.190
Remember in section 3 or 4 I can't really remember we covered the idea of creating a co-working space

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.150
if you're blanked on what that is.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.780
It's a relatively new model or you buy or lease a giant office space and you split it up to a variety

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.380
of different customers that need an office for themselves or for their small team.

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.780
Coworking spaces are kind of tied to the rise in freelancing and online solo partnership but also have

9
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.780
a lot to do with the ridiculous cost of real estate in San Francisco for instance.

10
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.310
There was a study two years ago I think two or three years ago that concluded that for every employee

11
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.390
you hire and keep in San Francisco you need to pay the equivalent about $30000 a year just to rent the

12
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.450
space needed for that one person.

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.110
That adds up quickly and that is how expensive it is out here.

14
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.070
On the flip side though you can rent a private office at a co-working space also in San Francisco for

15
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.040
four or five hundred dollars a month which equates to about $6000 a year.

16
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.320
Way way cheaper.

17
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.550
And they have the amenities like the water with the cucumbers in them $100 a month for the space presumably

18
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.260
$400 a month for the cucumber water anyway.

19
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.940
They're getting more popular so why not do a case study on them.

20
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.120
So with a co-working space what do we have established already.

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.140
Well we thought through what tears we were going to charge and how much per We thought about user segmentation

22
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.030
a little bit.

23
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.870
We thought about roughly how much it would cost to lease the space.

24
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.020
And we covered a little bit about predicting vacancy rates and how they might affect our bottom line.

25
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.080
We also gave our first effort at predicting growth and how they would look numerically for our costs.

26
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.480
Okay.

27
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.230
So in the next set of lectures we're going to get even more into depth with this model and start answering

28
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.730
even more questions.

29
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.180
All right guys.

30
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.830
See you later.
