1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:00.870
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.760
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:11.130
We went over the assumptions set ups for these models and now let's take a look at the sales worksheets

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.760
so let's first take a look at the simulator sales.

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.010
Right.

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.700
So these are based on these assumptions here are certain rates and we have some assumptions around the

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.020
utilization as well.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.840
So let's take a look.

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.200
So the first part.

10
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.080
Anytime we do these models we have to start with the day and month.

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.720
That way we can keep track of things as we model out in different worksheets.

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.590
One of the first things we do when we're thinking about something that has a certain capacity.

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.800
And then you're charging money for the use of that.

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.050
Some of that capacity where you want to start off with is making some assumptions around what percentage

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.720
of those that capacity is going to be used.

16
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.440
So if you have different day parts you're going to have to make different assumptions about the utilization

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.210
right.

18
00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:01.110
So these are assumptions were that daytime rates are going to be less utilize just because people are

19
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.220
at work on the weekdays they're going to be not there on the weekdays at all.

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.730
They may be more busy during the day time.

21
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.240
So then in the evening then there should be a higher utilization because in the evenings even if somebody

22
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.420
has the time to go play golf the golf course is dark and it might be cold or it might be raining.

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.710
So the evening utilization rates will be higher.

24
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.910
But like most brick and mortar businesses it takes time to get your name out there.

25
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.430
It takes time to get the word out there for people to start finding you.

26
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.630
So it takes time to really ramp up the utilization before it reaches some sort of stabilized rate.

27
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.060
So these were the assumes stabilize utilization rates for for the both the large and the small simulators.

28
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.430
And then there was an assumption around the membership count here in the membership utilization.

29
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.960
This is basically of the hours that are utilized.

30
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.400
What percentage of them are utilized by the members who are getting a discount basically on the hourly

31
00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.710
rate.

32
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.230
So that's why we have to track that there.

33
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.040
And here just based on the number of members does the membership dues that are there.

34
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:17.450
And so then what we do is then we look at the all the deep parts for each of the groups of simulator's.

35
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.310
So we have the private ones and then we look at the weekday versus weekend.

36
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.870
And we also look at daytime versus the evening you know if we change our assumptions about how we have

37
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.940
more of these or we add more private ones then these calculations will automatically update.

38
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.450
So based on the assumptions on the front we looked at how many hours ferse are available.

39
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.830
So daytime hours are available that can be Blease will be the hours available per station per day that

40
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.970
it's open times the number of stations.

41
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.300
Right.

42
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.770
And then times number of days that's operating in that given month.

43
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.940
So we're looking at weekday versus weekend so that when we have these different total possible hours

44
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.070
and then of those hours how many hours are utilized.

45
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.390
And then of the utilize hours what part of it is from members what part of it is from nonmembers and

46
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.910
it gets calculated there.

47
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.960
So we do that for the VIP as well as the semi-private ones weekday day weekends daytime evenings.

48
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.710
We do it for all of them and then we can have all of the revenues and from that we can calculate the

49
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.900
total revenue from nonmembers the total revenue from members and then basically the total revenue from

50
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.590
Seamew lation rentals.

51
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.560
Now once we have that we have daytime and evening time as well we can break that down range but because

52
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.180
during the first few months it's going to be grand opening there's a discount we're going to factor

53
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.930
that discount here see that.

54
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.130
And then we then look at what the final revenue figures are from month 1 and onwards.

55
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.910
So there you go.

56
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.830
That's the simulator hours.

57
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.600
Now what we have down here is basically aggregating some of that information by for that for the year.

58
00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.990
So we can look at it by year.

59
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.090
This is good for making summaries.

60
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.790
We see that in the first year we're only assuming that you know the average simulator is averaging 7

61
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.590
hours least out of the 18 hours that's available during the day.

62
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.220
And then when it stabilize from your 2 through 5 it is averaging 11 hours a day.

63
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.440
All right.

64
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.980
The next part is the food and drink assumptions right.

65
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.660
Remember we talked about patrons that are just non-golf offers and then patrons that are golfers.

66
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.010
So that's one of the things we made the distinction for right.

67
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.550
We had this whole part is golfing patrons and then non-coffee patrons.

68
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.030
OK.

69
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.510
All right.

70
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:45.780
And then from there we made some assumptions around gross sales of food and wine in the front.

71
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.440
We had some assumptions around that words of food food and wine here.

72
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.710
Right.

73
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.000
So we looked at hey what is the average group size that that's really important right because if you

74
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.670
know the larger the group then the larger the orders on average because you're renting.

75
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.870
We're making an estimate how many golfing patrons are there based on the hours that are at least.

76
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.540
Right so each hour that's least we say well what's the average party size that's there.

77
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.050
OK.

78
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.550
So that's what this group number of groups and comes from.

79
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.050
OK.

80
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.090
And DAs and from there we can derive the sales for all of these.

81
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.270
And so we have grow sales and then because we we know the margins for them we know what kind of cost

82
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.410
of sales we would need.

83
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.110
And then here would be the revenues from the food and drink for the golfing patrons.

84
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.820
And then we do the same thing for the non-golf patrons.

85
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.680
So we have them here as well.

86
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.650
So then when we combine them we have total food costs food sales.

87
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.320
Technically these should be net revenues so just get to make some corrections even though it's in really

88
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.950
old model that I did before.

89
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.350
OK.

90
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.200
So there we go we have the total food sales.

91
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.780
And again we can summarize them if we want and look at you know whether what's the difference between

92
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.390
alcohol sales and on alcohol sales based on the assumptions and the final sales projections here based

93
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:12.340
on the assumptions we made around other revenue sources like merchandising and golf lessons and ad revenue.

94
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.170
All right.

95
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.150
Those are the sales pages.

96
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.980
The next part we're going to look at some of the operating expense assumptions on the cost side of it

97
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.090
and then see what it looks like when we combine everything in the summerise.
