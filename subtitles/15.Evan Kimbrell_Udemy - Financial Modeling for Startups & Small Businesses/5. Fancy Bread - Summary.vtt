Hey Hey welcome back to the fancy bread.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.490
Case study now in the previous lectures we went over the modeling of the revenue as well as the expenses

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.630
so now we can kind of put it together.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.000
All right.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.730
So here on the summary sheet we're just going to put all the cash flow together.

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.140
We're going to have the timing here.

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.260
We're going to have the timing of the start of area.

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.860
Again these are numbers or we're going to make sure they're not showing as currency.

9
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.550
And then what we started with remember was we did it by looking at hey what if we wanted to look at

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.920
a certain number of ad impressions first going from there to click through to then conversions right.

11
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.480
So clients that we're getting the sign up were getting all of them to sign up through the web.

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.320
So then from there we have the number of new monthly customers that are acquired each month.

13
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.500
We factor in some attrition.

14
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.870
We also had some movement between the different tiers of customers.

15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.980
So then we have the new customer count and then from there we have the cumulative customer account because

16
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.410
every month that they stay on as a customer they got to pay them monthly dues.

17
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.420
So from there we have the direct customer revenue but some of them brought in gas and sometimes they

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.270
brought in gas more frequently than they were allowed to.

19
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.210
So then they would have overages right and of the customers that had guests overages they had these

20
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.660
guests overage hours which were charged at six dollars an hour.

21
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.010
In our case right now and then so there was a total gas overage revenue and then we can combine that

22
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.370
with the direct revenue the monthly dues we have the total revenue by group and then we group that together

23
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.870
we have the gross revenue.

24
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.350
Now on the spend side we had our start up costs rent that was kicking in right away during that period

25
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.180
of time.

26
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.370
And then after the start up costs are in we have the customers and the hours that they were using and

27
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.550
based on the total hours that were use both customers and guests hours both free and overage guests

28
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.350
hours we had the total usage cost.

29
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.930
We also have the CPM cost the advertising cost right there.

30
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.600
We also have the partnership acquisition cost.

31
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.490
We also had overhead in terms of compensation for labor as well as other per person overhead and other

32
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.990
monthly expenses.

33
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.660
So then when we combine all that we have the total run rate then we can find out based on the cash thats

34
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.510
coming in as well as the cash is going now we would see when we would actually have a breakeven.

35
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.700
And also on a cumulative cash basis we can figure out what the maximum cash need would be or any of

36
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.170
the outlay.

37
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.050
So looks like with these assumptions the maximum cash need is about four hundred a thousand dollars

38
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.620
to go back to the Startup tab 480000 thats needed maybe we'll add another 10 percent padding to it.

39
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.030
So then the total funding need.

40
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.760
My end up looking like 450000.

41
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.100
So the thing about this is as you build the model you might change your assumptions.

42
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.490
Right.

43
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.860
So the main thing is to feel comfortable with how it's constructed and then you know you don't need

44
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.240
to initially worry about whether your assumptions are correct after you build your model if you're good

45
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.630
with and comfortable with the logic of how it flows.

46
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.720
Then you can drill down on all of the assumptions to make sure that he is 30 grand for living expenses

47
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.720
for you know two co-founders for six months that reasonable or are we crazy or are we going to be eating

48
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.690
ramen every day you know.

49
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.530
Or is it's fine.

50
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.180
So then he can drill in on all the assumptions and then make adjustments there.

51
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.950
So there you go.

52
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.370
You get the fancy bread case study here with the model.
