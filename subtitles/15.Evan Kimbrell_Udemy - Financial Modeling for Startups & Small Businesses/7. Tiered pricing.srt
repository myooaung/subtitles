00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,690
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:09,030
We're going to look at the tear pricing revenue model now structurally and logically at least in terms

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,760
of the modeling it's going to look very similar to what we did in terms of the subscription business

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,540
model.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,690
The only difference here is that the subscription plans we have tiers of plans that are going to mix

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,550
it up a little bit in this example to show you some differences but structurally you're going to see

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,400
that it's very similar and it's not so difficult to do.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,520
Let's take a look.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:37,110
Hey All right let's do a quick sanity check of what a business like this might look like that's going

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,790
to look pretty simple right.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,000
We're going to start with some leads some of them are going to convert into clients.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,860
And if we have three tiers of services we break them down into those three tiers and we can calculate

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,640
how many clients are within each tier and if they're paying a monthly fee within each of the tears then

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,490
we can calculate the total revenue for each tier by multiplying the number of clients in the Tier 2

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,580
times the price that they pay each month.

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,430
And we do the same.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,500
We get the total monthly revenue.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,550
So this is simple enough so lets look at a simple model for this as well.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:19,680
If we start with say some ads some of them become leads and of those leads we convert 5 percent so every

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,630
month we're adding 50 new clients right.

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,220
And then the total number of clients cumulative clients in any given month is here.

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,720
It gets to 600 clients at the end of the month.

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,100
So then if we look at the price or the number of clients within each tier we can calculate that for

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,230
each month same as the front and then we do the same for the revenue.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,510
Right.

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,160
So this is pretty simple here.

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,110
But let's turn it up a notch in the next nado.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,530
So in the next model we're looking at the same kind of set up up here.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:57,520
Okay let's say that same number of ads and then some of them become leads the leads become clients.

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,380
All of this here is the same.

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,800
All right.

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,620
With these tears.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:11,250
So the first part actually is the same as well is you know we have the number of clients times the cumulative

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,280
number of clients that are there.

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:13,950
Okay.

36
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,070
And then this one we got to do the first one there.

37
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:24,050
So when we have this what we can do then is we can start factoring things like say attrition.

38
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:31,410
So if we have different attrition rates for different tiers then we can calculate the number of clients

39
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,560
that are going to be there after attrition.

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:42,510
So post attrition is going to be the number of clients for that tier times one minus the attrition rate

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,820
for that here.

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,840
Now what we have is we have our clients that are actually still there after attrition.

43
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,800
But one thing that we may see in these kinds of businesses is that there is going to be some movement

44
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:03,840
between the tiers we may see some movement from Tier 1 to 2 and 3 from Tier 2 to 1 and 3 and from Tier

45
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,140
3 to 1 and 2.

46
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,380
And when you make some assumptions around that to monitor that out you know this is sometimes a good

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,450
metric to keep as well for these kinds of businesses because if they start to see something really wonky

48
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,720
like there is really high attrition rate going from 3 to then we know there is something going on that

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,870
not keeping the clients in the Tier 3 maybe they got to change up some of the services or maybe change

50
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,530
of pricing or whatever it is they got to see what's going on that's create making that kind of movement.

51
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,890
Okay let's see.

52
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,780
Once we make some assumptions around that we can calculate the actual movements that are going to be

53
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,440
happening throughout these tiers right.

54
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,510
So when there's three tiers MI 6 movements we have to track.

55
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:46,940
Okay.

56
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,630
So the movement from 1 to 2.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,210
Right.

58
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,000
So we're going to calculate is then we're going to have the movement from one to two times the number

59
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,570
of clients that are moving from Tier 1 right.

60
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,460
So there's the number of clients there.

61
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,590
So we have that kind of movement.

62
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,910
And that's the number of movement for from 1 to 3.

63
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,310
We're not going to worry about whole numbers right now I'm just going to try to introduce this framework

64
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,850
for you.

65
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,080
We can always round to the nearest customers.

66
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,480
Okay.

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,560
Since you know how to do that by now.

68
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,020
All right.

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,860
And we do the same for the other ones.

70
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,570
So we're going to have the Tier 2 clients times this movement to one and then we're going to do the

71
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,770
same.

72
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,500
This is the Tier 2 clients with the movement 2 3.

73
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:35,930
Right.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,390
So we're going around that we're going to just make it nice and clean and then copy it across.

75
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:50,220
Do the same for the we just copy this but we have to change the reference here right to the correct

76
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,740
row.

77
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,730
So we'll have that and move this across.

78
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,110
Okay.

79
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,150
So then now we have this kind of movement.

80
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,550
So then we can calculate the actual number of clients post movement.

81
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,820
Now we're going to assume all of this movement happens at the beginning of the pain cycle for simplicity

82
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,600
so and so is of attrition.

83
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,250
Everything is happening at the beginning of the month.

84
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,710
Now we're going to see what the final Klein count is right.

85
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,870
So the final clean count is going to be what we started with before the movement.

86
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,340
And we're going to minus what moved out minus that minus that going.

87
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,040
And what came in for each of these.

88
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:35,360
You see that now we're going to do the same for the Tier 2 1 or 2 Tier 2 minus what moved out right

89
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,140
both of these.

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,480
And then we're going to add what came in.

91
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,780
That's what came in and that's what came in.

92
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,560
Make sure we did this correctly.

93
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,350
Yes.

94
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,510
And then now is the third one starting point minus what was going out of Tier 3 and then Plus what's

95
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,170
coming in that's coming in.

96
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,860
And so is that one coming in now that we have all of those.

97
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,610
Now we have a final user account and then we can calculate the revenues for that month.

98
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,940
Right.

99
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,620
So then we have to clear the number of clients in each tier times.

100
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:13,520
The pricing for that here and then we can calculate the monthly and then the the sum is just going to

101
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,680
be the sum of those.

102
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,110
So when you have tears sometimes you can think about not just the attrition but you think about the

103
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,570
movement in between the tiers as well.

104
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,020
And this is one way to account for that.
