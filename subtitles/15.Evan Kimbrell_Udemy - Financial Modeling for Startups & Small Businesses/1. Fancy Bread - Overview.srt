1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,410
Figure it is welcome back.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:07,050
All right so in the next set of lectures we're going to cover yet another case study this study coming

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,470
up is what we call fancy bread because it's based off of an app called croissant.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,950
Yeah I know we're super original so sorry when I were talking.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,950
Well designing a curriculum for this course and this idea stuck out to us as an interesting Casely to

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,450
explore.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:30,420
We've already covered the concept of you works right which is a co-working space but for this case study

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,500
we're going to analyze the model of what if we made an app where you could subscribe to like a set plan

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,830
and then have unlimited or limited access to many different co-working spaces.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,520
That's essentially what croissant is and it's something I actually use probably four times a week.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,450
As it turns out part of the fun of co-working spaces is the flexibility.

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,740
And why not instead of staying at just one every single day turning it into a boring office.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,020
Why not try out all of them if you're familiar with the company.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,370
They might be defunct or just pivoted or something.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,190
It's called class pass.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,580
The idea with them was kind of similar.

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,810
You pay something like 60 to $200 a month.

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,400
Then you get a set amount of credits that you could spend at any type of exercise class could be spinning

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,460
class can be weight lifting the yoga can be Zuba or could be whatever the hottest thing all the moms

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,150
are currently doing all CORSAN is kind of like that for coworking spaces.

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,820
Monday you might go to this one Tuesday.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,020
You might try out this one Wednesday and Thursday you might try another one and then next week you might

23
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,770
mix it up again and start all over.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,660
So in this model what do you think we'll anticipate running into while we have a subscription system

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,410
so a lot of the same dynamics that any other subscription business apply.

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,970
Things like churn and things like lifetime value.

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,430
We also have on the supply side individual companies that own the coworking spaces that we have to negotiate

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,050
rates with.

29
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,140
How do you think we compensate these companies.

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,090
Do you think they give us access for free to their spaces because of the exposure kind of doubt it.

31
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,930
Most likely they probably charge us a very low hourly rate for how long the fancy bread user spends

32
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,210
at their place.

33
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,460
Then in order to make the numbers work have to make sure that users on average dont spend enough time

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,800
at these places for us to pay out more than what they paid us.

35
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,850
Whether or not that works in the long term who knows.

36
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,670
It's a bit of a tightrope to walk.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,370
But nevertheless it's an interesting model right.

38
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,420
How do you think this would look as it scaled up.

39
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,200
Well let's dive into it next lecture and start working through it.

40
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,840
All right see the.
