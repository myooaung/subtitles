00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:00.860
All right.

2
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.620
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.940
In this lecture we're going to quickly summarize these smoke Chile case study.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.070
So we did the revenues we did the expenses and we also did the startup costs here along with the timing.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.470
Now where we can look at is we can put it all together and look at how much do we really need to ramp

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.780
up.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.060
Right.

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.720
And the way we looked at that is similar to what we'd done before.

9
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.280
We have we lay out all of the sales here.

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.890
So we get the sales that's pull from the revenue.

11
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.970
Here's all the timing right.

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.440
We don't get sales until there's the grand opening here and then we looked at all this startup related

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.150
expenses here then we did all the operating expenses.

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:50.280
That's haul from the expense worksheet and then from there we can look at the net cash flow right in

15
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.110
a given month.

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.350
So we see we didn't when we do the cash flow we see that it takes a while before it turns positive.

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.080
Right.

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.730
And so one of the ways to look at what's called a break even.

19
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.060
Basically when do we start making more cash than we're spending right and have a net cash flow that's

20
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.040
positive that's when you break even.

21
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.270
And the way you do that is we can do this simple formula.

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:24.290
We're we check the captain net cash flow and we check this condition that says In okay and means both

23
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.670
conditions need to be true and the conditions that need to be true is if this is less than zero.

24
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.020
And this is greater than zero.

25
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.060
So we basically say if if in the previous month we had a negative cash flow and then the current month

26
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.320
is positive cash flow then make the sell equal to the month otherwise show a blank.

27
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.030
Okay.

28
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.330
So what that does is it's going to be a blank until the month where it starts to turn around.

29
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.330
We'll see right around there.

30
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.560
Right.

31
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.420
When it turns out was negative and then positive.

32
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.880
So that's when it starts to break even.

33
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.130
Right.

34
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.110
So that means that month and then I made it equal to the maximum value in that row because everything's

35
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.900
either nothing or that month that were it breaks even.

36
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:20.040
It tells me the break even month and then when we look that the cumulative cash position right where

37
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.450
we just looked at what's the most cash that we'd need you know given these assumptions and when we do

38
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.770
that we find that peaks out at seven hundred and sixty one thousand.

39
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.030
Right.

40
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.020
And then once it kind of breaks even we're able to maintain and slowly make money after that so in this

41
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.550
case the max cash deficit is a little over 760000.

42
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.570
We're going to go back to the start of worksheet pull that cash here.

43
00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:01.350
We're going to do that 10 percent contingency again and then that give us our total capital or investment

44
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.890
need to start and run this restaurant.

45
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.160
Right.

46
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:13.920
So here all this startup costs but then because you need a ramp up to ramp up your sales you need working

47
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.390
capital to pay for the labor pay for rent pay for all those things until you break even.

48
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.990
Which in this case is about 13 months.

49
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.530
So the total investment with a little bit of cushion that we added 10 percent a cushion is going to

50
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.610
be a hundred and just under and 40000 here.
