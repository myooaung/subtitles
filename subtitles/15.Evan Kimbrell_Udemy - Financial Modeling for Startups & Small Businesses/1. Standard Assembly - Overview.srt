00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,730
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:08,340
All right on deck we have our first case study where we're going to take a theoretical business and

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,920
show you how you would think through it.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,300
And finally model out everything for it.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,850
In this case we're going to go over the business model of an in-person programming boot camp which is

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,680
really quite a growth industry nowadays if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,790
Boot camps are a business that got popular more or less in the last five years.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,010
You see the thing is tech companies have an insatiable demand for programmers and filling programming

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,120
positions is one of the hardest things for them to do.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,560
Frankly they're just not enough programmers to fill the demand and thus we see these bizarre market

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:54,450
economics where you have Apple and Google and Facebook paying something like $45000 to a recruiter just

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,360
for the introduction to a programmer who needs a job.

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,280
It's gotten crazy but we are there.

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,690
So boot camp sprung up as a way to help facilitate the growth in supply.

15
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,980
The idea is that you apply or just sign up in the case of the less reputable ones and then you go through

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,920
an intensive training course that lasts anywhere from two to four months usually at the end of the boot

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,510
camp.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,640
The idea is that you're now effectively vetted by the organization and then they help you find placement

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,930
for your job which to be honest isn't terribly hard.

20
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,260
Assuming that he did it even moderate.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,210
Good job of training the person in the first place.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,250
So in this case study we're going to tear down on that specific business model these boot camps typically

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,540
cost something like a semester of private college tuition to attend and some are downright cutthroat

24
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,420
to get into if you're still blinking on this.

25
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,350
What I'm talking about.

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,830
Just go google programming bootcamp Plus the name of any major city and you'll see them.

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,930
You can also look at a site called course report or put in the resources which ranks them out and discusses

28
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,700
their pros and cons.

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,520
General Assembly if you ever heard that one it's a well-known company that first started off with bootcamps

30
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,160
and has expanded but still offers classes in a very similar ish model.

31
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:18,690
So what do you think we're going to run into when we crack open the model of a in-person programming

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,420
bootcamp.

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,060
Well we're selling a high ticket item to a small to medium sized group of people.

34
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,810
Do we want a million customers.

35
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,300
No.

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,160
We can only reasonably handle a handful of them actually.

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,170
How do you think will advertising get attention.

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,690
Well it really just depends.

39
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:44,310
But when you're charging upwards of $10000 for two to four months of training I'd say you have some

40
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,410
room to experiment now on the cost side.

41
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,500
What do you think we're going to have to pay for.

42
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,160
While teachers administrators possibly even paid speakers.

43
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,750
We have overhead in that we have to rent or own buildings.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,140
We might have to handle or supply computers and we might need to handle outreach in some way after they

45
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,710
graduate presumably.

46
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,830
So take a sec to make sure you can wrap your head around the bizarre world of the programming bootcamp

47
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,110
and then join us in the next lecture when we start going over what a model for a theoretical bootcamp

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,670
called I don't know we'll call it standard assembly might look like.

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,260
All right guys.

50
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,820
See you then.
