1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,280
Her I remember when we first did the Ewart's case study we had something like this right.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:14,040
We had some assumptions around the subscription of the spots for the shared desks we get oversubscribed

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,150
because not everybody is going to show up at the same time.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,030
But for the private desk in the private offices we don't oversubscribed and then we were able to model

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,690
things out starting with occupancy going to calculating gross rents and then tackling a vacancy.

6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:38,160
Now the problem with this is that it assumes on month one we have something that doesn't factor in the

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,820
startup period right.

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,150
We're doing build now we're doing a launch and we're kind of spending a lot of cash before we're actually

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,180
able to pull in revenue.

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,640
So in our updated model we have to factor that in.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,150
So in our updated model the assumptions here look the same up top up what we need to know is the timing

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,430
of it.

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:04,480
So here we have the timing of closing is just basically when we actually bought things.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,230
Okay so closing what happened in the first month but then permitting starts right away and then at last

15
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,680
for you know in our assumption 3 months.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,360
And then there was then construction that happens some period after that.

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,220
Right now I have nine months and then we have the launch that's happening here.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,020
Okay.

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,520
And then so from there all the way from the beginning is kind of a through out period of before it becomes

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,160
active before we start taking in revenue right.

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,620
Then after that only after that when it's no longer doing all that stuff we're like fully activated.

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,280
Okay.

23
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,230
Right here.

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,840
And that's when we start pulling in getting customers to come in and start paying.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,790
So that's why we needed to adjust this model in this way because you can't bring people in before you're

26
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,450
done with construction be doing your launch and everything right.

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,580
So then then only after that we can calculate again.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Same way we calculate the girl's rents and the vacancies and then we can get to net rents.

29
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,710
So the big difference here is looking at the timing here and the timing comes from looking at this the

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,890
startup page closing is always a good way to just say it's happening right away basically in the first

31
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,180
month.

32
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,710
And then you know for things that have a real estate element to it usually you can have some sort of

33
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,510
a permuting period getting approvals zoning and then you can start construction right.

34
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,660
Then after you do construction you have some sort of a launch period.

35
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:31,950
OK.

36
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,120
So that's what we're doing here.

37
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,460
We have all these startup expenses but you're not spending them all on day one you're spending them

38
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,380
in those corresponding parts.

39
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,230
Now we do the timing and the revenue as well because we don't want to kick that in again before the

40
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,330
actual timing starts.

41
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,630
So there you go.

42
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,550
That is our revenue and in the next like we're going to talk about the expenses.
