00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,300
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,080
In this case study we are going to look at the SAS business model.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,990
Specifically we're going to do a case study on a company called SAS force may sound like something you

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,430
know now if you're new to SAS.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,840
SAS stands for software as a service.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,510
This is where business creates a software that helps clients to do something on an ongoing basis.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,470
Usually their clients or customers pay on a subscription based service and sometimes it's tiered as

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,180
well.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,990
So broadly speaking he says companies will fall into three categories of SAS companies.

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,890
The first are what we would call the revenue increases.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,460
These are the SEST companies that help their clients grow their top line revenue.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,510
They help with increasing sales they might drive more leads may help with the marketing.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,800
But anything that helps them increase the top line revenue sales force will be one of those companies

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,140
or at least some of their products would fall into that category.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,180
Now the opposite of that will be the cost reducers the SEST companies focus on efficiency.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
They help their clients become more efficient and save cost.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,380
They may look for cost savings and generally as a whole they try to target claiming somewhere between

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,810
10 to 15 percent of the cost savings of their clients.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,040
You know if they're working with clients who are in industries where their clients are spending millions

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,800
or billions of dollars every year a percentage of those savings could be super lucrative.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,940
Now the third category of SAS companies will we be what we call the productivity businesses these SAS

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,880
solutions help their clients become more effective at what they do.

23
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:56,210
And its not necessarily tied with cost savings or driving sales but that those could be results as well.

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,490
But they tend to focus on things like making them more efficient with meetings or reducing associate

25
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:10,190
turnover or shortening the time it takes associates to get up to speed and becoming productive.

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,520
This category of SAS companies tend to be a little bit easier to sustain just because if your revenue

27
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,120
increase your are a cost reducer there tends to be a limit after a while.

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,840
If you're looking at year over year trying to keep improving you're going to reach some sort of limit.

29
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,120
Now for those math nerds out there we're going to be talking about these businesses reaching some sort

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,830
of Asymptote.

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,790
Anyways enough about that.

32
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,240
What are we going to look at here.

33
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,660
In this case study we're going to do a hypothetical case study on a SAS company called SAS force that

34
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,770
has a business solution that they sell to their clients.

35
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:56,990
Now like all SAS companies their solutions tend to take quite a bit of money and some time to develop.

36
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,870
And then after it gets develop it requires quite an investment in a sales team and marketing in order

37
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,140
to get and drive sales.

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:14,610
Now usually the sales set up for these companies have the companies offering their sales people a commission

39
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,870
of the sales.

40
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,520
So we're going to look at a common set up and model that out.

41
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,100
We're also going to look at what happens if you hire sales people at different rates.

42
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,200
You're hiring salespeople at a faster rate you tend to see your revenues grow.

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,140
But you also need to factor in things like the sales efficiency or effectiveness of the sales person.

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,160
It took a little while before they get good at what they do.

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,200
So when you hire a new salesperson they don't get to their full efficiency until after a certain amount

46
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,810
of time.

47
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,670
Really fact that in as well and the business model a Starbright right in.
