1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,810
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,360
So for the last section we spent the entire time daydreaming about revenue and how we can chart our

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,890
inevitable hockey stick like growth.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,620
But allow me to be the Debbie Downer in the crowd and tell you that we are now going to focus on the

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,600
other side of the equation.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,010
I know likes to talk about the expenses.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,560
I'm told I would go so far as to say that understanding your expenses and the relationship they have

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,130
with your expansion is probably more important than understanding your revenue model and potential growth

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,050
rate.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,670
A lot of modeling revenue is just guesswork.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,690
We assume that we'll get this many customers now in this money later.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:46,210
But with the expenses we can very easily get real numbers and figure out is this even feasible.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,160
Expenses are expensive and you can quote me on that.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,040
But one distinction we need to understand about our expensive patients is that there are two types of

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,000
costs.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,060
Number one is what we call startup cost and number two is what we call operating expenses.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,680
The best way to think about sort of cost is that there are the costs you incur to get up and running

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,240
whereas your operating expenses are the expenses you need to keep your business running on a day to

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,140
day basis.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,400
In the modeling warm up where we created a lemonade stand empire we didn't incorporate startup costs

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,990
because the assumption was that we could scrounge for tables chairs pitchers and the sign that we would

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,750
need the things that went into the cost of each cup of lemonade on the other hand the sugar the lemons

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,490
the cups and the labor.

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,700
We considered those operating expenses you can further divide operating senses down if you want to into

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:46,080
expenses directly related to a sale like the ingredients and into expenses not necessarily related to

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,000
the sale directly like overhead.

27
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:56,370
You know let's say if you had to pay rent for your table spot or you pay liability insurance in case

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,280
someone accidentally ODIs on your sweetness.

29
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,080
Those would be examples of overhead.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,410
All right I think we understand the distinction.

31
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,340
If not just ask in the Q&amp;A or the slack group.

32
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,530
Let's dive a little bit into startup costs so we can see how they get visualized on a model.

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,480
Okay let's stick with the lemonade example if we were starting up again just like it was yesterday what

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,140
would we need to get.

35
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,640
Well we need all of the things associated with first selling some lemonade and we might need the big

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,550
ticket items that allow us to even operate in general.

37
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,490
You can think of startup costs as being split between two things.

38
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:41,370
Thing is you need to get in order to get started and things you need to handle the early parts of your

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,060
growth.

40
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,580
Yes I know theres a fuzzy period between operating expenses and startup cost but in general you like

41
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,850
to think of everything you plan for at the very beginning plus a little bit of runway as your startup

42
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,600
costs everything past that once you're flying.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,850
Operating expenses.

44
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,830
Do you need a table to get started.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,580
Yes absolutely you do.

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,900
That would fall into the first category and if we were let's say anticipating 100 sales on the first

47
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,030
day well we might need to buy 100 cups up front as well.

48
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,520
Those within count as expenses for the first couple days of growth.

49
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,950
So in the model I'm going to divide the two sets of expenses into what's associated with the station

50
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,870
and those are for getting the stand set up.

51
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,680
If I add in all of the items we covered previously and out of total Well a very rudimentary estimate

52
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,880
of our startup costs.

53
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,460
Okay but what about all of the things you need for your first set of sales you need ingredients and

54
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,030
cups.

55
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,600
Right.

56
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,600
So let's add these things in line at the other cost.

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,930
Let's assume we order all of our ingredients and cup slash napkins in small batches just to be safe

58
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,900
in case this business let's say flops day one because we want to make sure this cost falls squarely

59
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,050
into the realm of startup costs.

60
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,770
Let's just add the cost for what we would need for the first two days of sales.

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,730
You go past that.

62
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,250
Well good luck explaining to the IRS why that counts as a startup cost.

63
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,940
So it's a based off of our old predictions and Section 1 that will sell some insane amount of lemonade.

64
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,160
In reality when making a model you'll want to loop this back into the unit predictions you previously

65
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,310
made for us we're just going to say these costs are a good buffer for the first days of operations.

66
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,990
We're not really going to take it that much farther.

67
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,600
Okay so now we have a more complete look at what we would need in our bank account to get started on

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,660
day one.

69
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,970
If you have the dough then you could probably pull this off.

70
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,680
But of course there's always more to think about and take into consideration.

71
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,750
Do you think planning to float yourself for two days is enough.

72
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,410
Well I'd say that seems a little aggressive right.

73
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,460
Well as it turns out yes it is aggressive but you could get even more aggressive and you could do one

74
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,270
day instead.

75
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,500
And of course there's pros and cons for a large runway versus a short one the prose obviously is that

76
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,690
you need less money upfront and you're more likely to say yes I can afford this.

77
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,300
Whereas the cons are that you might need to take money from a loan shark to cover payroll.

78
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,850
In fact let's try to be realistic with this.

79
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,990
Two days is fine but only if we get these exact expenses.

80
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,590
What happens if we get a fine for where we put our table.

81
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,560
What EVMs of a pitcher breaks and we have to replace it.

82
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,380
Well we need to add the age old concept in of any contingency.

83
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,260
Generally I like to do contingency one of two ways.

84
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:42,980
One I try to think of all the worst case issues that could happen and then double it or to make it a

85
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,430
percentage of your cost in this case I'm just going to write down $250 but you could base it off like

86
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,040
I don't know 10 percent of your cost base 20 percent 30 percent.

87
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,450
However risky you're feeling these contingency numbers very heavily by not only your risk tolerance

88
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,820
but also your industry.

89
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,220
OK.

90
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,100
One last thing we might want to throw in.

91
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,980
Let's say you hire your sales associates or ministers as they're called and they're just not cutting

92
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,420
it on the first day.

93
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,270
Well let's say they accidentally overheard a Bernie Sanders rally and are now unionizing.

94
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,850
Or maybe sales are just slow.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,430
Let's build on a contingency that takes into account labor.

96
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,990
You the cost estimates we established way back in Section 1.

97
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:32,450
We can make a contingency plan of say 50 percent of what we project will spend on monthly labor cost

98
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,150
that could cover a whole lot of different labor related issues because remember when you first start

99
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,390
a business you have no idea what you'll need.

100
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,510
It might turn out that you need two times as many employees or just higher caliber salespeople.

101
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,420
These are things that are worth taking into consideration.

102
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,770
All right guys see you in the next lecture.
