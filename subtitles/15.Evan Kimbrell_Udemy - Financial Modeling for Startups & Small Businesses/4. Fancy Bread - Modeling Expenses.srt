1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,250
Hey welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,580
Now we're looking at the expenses sheet here for the expenses sheet.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,550
We want to track the main thing is the number of hours that the customers are actually going to be using

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,930
at the offices right for each hour they're going to be using at the co-working spaces we're going to

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:26,300
have to pay our partners our co-working space partners some dollar amount that we're going to owe them.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:26,780
Right.

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,650
So in order to do that first thing we're going to do is look at the maximum number of hours that are

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:39,220
available per month for the Explorer it's 10 for the creators 40 for the luminary it's unlimited but

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,290
really it's not that unlimited right.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,610
There's still a limited number of hours per month in the given month.

11
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,200
So we're just going to make an assumption around what that is.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:59,230
And I think right here I'm assuming that there's five days a week times 12 hours per day times four

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,990
weeks per hour per month so about 240 total hours in a co-working space.

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,430
We can make that and more we can make it 300 hours.

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,650
You know if you're trying to include some evenings and weekend hours that are available as well.

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,190
So you know if we make it 300 hours that's fine.

17
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,990
And then the average utilization that's going to be more important.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,290
Right.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,730
We're going to have to make an assumption around here of those available hours that somebody could use.

20
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,540
On average how much are they going to be using for the explorers.

21
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,440
They're probably going to be using a pretty high utilization since they only have 10 hours.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,800
Right.

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,540
You may even assume that they're going to just use it all up for the creators of 40 hours.

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,330
So froggery pretty high.

25
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,400
But for the luminaries you know they're going to be going there on a regular basis even if they are

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,650
going you know 40 hours a week.

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,150
Like full work week every week they're really looking at 160 hours right.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,640
So maybe forty five percent of 300 hours.

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,680
So we don't need to know exactly what it is but we just want to make sure we account for that kind of

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,090
information right now.

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,430
Now we still need to track the hours that are used by guests as well.

32
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:07,810
Right.

33
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,090
So zero hours doesn't matter so 100 percent utilization of 0 0.

34
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,170
But if we change that in the future then we have this here so we can the model can account for that.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,570
Now for the creators there's five hours.

36
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,370
So we can assume that maybe they'll use most or all of it.

37
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,040
Right.

38
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,870
And something similar for the luminaries in terms of the guests hours.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,310
Okay.

40
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,070
So we have these assumptions now we're going to be able to factor that in later.

41
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,800
Now in order to do the right kind of timing for the expenses first thing we do is we've got to look

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,050
at the startup costs first.

43
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,290
Right.

44
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,970
So we we have the start schedule that we did before with the timing and then we have the categorization

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,180
of the start startup expenses by when it was going to happening during the development period during

46
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,670
the beta during the actual launch period or some of the costs that are happening throughout the whole

47
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,840
start up phase.

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,780
We have all the startup expenses here that are being spent and then that's our initial cash outflow.

49
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,450
Next we can actually start thinking about these hours and utilization.

50
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,350
So well first you know let's let's do an assumption around the costs maybe we can negotiate.

51
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,780
You know it's two bucks an hour for each customer that uses the co-working space initially but we think

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:30,820
as we get more and more people to use it and grow our user base over time maybe we can get that rate

53
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,800
down.

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,440
So this allows us to do that you know how to do that by now from looking at some of the similar things

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,070
that we did on the revenue worksheet.

56
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,480
Okay.

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,390
So this all this does is it calculates an initial price or costs per hour and then over time it reduces

58
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,030
it to our stabilize rate which was we're setting it at 125 and are now from there.

59
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,370
The next thing we want to do is we want to look at user.

60
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,860
Right.

61
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:03,490
We've got the cumulative customer count from our revenue side we looked at how many customers we have

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:11,210
in any given category in any given month after factoring in attrition and any movements in between those

63
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,600
kind of the final month figures.

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,040
So from there we also can calculate the percentage that we're bringing gas.

65
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,600
Right.

66
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,500
And then the customer hours that are use.

67
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:22,980
Okay.

68
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,680
So that comes from looking at the utilization we have the utilization times the maximum hours times

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,110
how many people were in how many customers are there.

70
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,800
So then we have the hours of that were used in that give them a total.

71
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,260
We also have guest hours that are used right from these free guest hours plus the we're pulling something

72
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,020
from the revenue side here which is plus the overage guests hours that was calculated.

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,740
So that still costs us money.

74
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,190
So we've got to factor that in.

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,680
So we have both customer hours and the total guest hours both free and overage guests hours then we

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
have the total hours when you combine the two.

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,390
So now that we have these total hours we then can calculate the total cost of office usage.

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,640
Right.

79
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:14,620
So we already have the cost calculated the total hours will just be this costs times the total hours

80
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,850
use which will give us the total cost here.

81
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,400
Okay.

82
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,920
So this is a total off cost of the office usage by tier of customer.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,090
Next thing we can think about was the advertising costs.

84
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,210
So we have a certain amount of ad impressions that are coming in.

85
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,850
So per CPM right.

86
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,220
That was coming from the front.

87
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,370
And then if we have a CPM schedule maybe initially were not that good at it were paying more and over

88
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,340
time we are better at it were getting better rates were more targeted than you know it can go down over

89
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,900
time and you may be able to save money but maybe you already can be the opposite.

90
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,840
You can do either.

91
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,260
Okay.

92
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,510
If it gets more expensive you just put the more expensive rate here and it will update accordingly from

93
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,200
there.

94
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:08,470
It's just the total ad impressions in the thousands times the cost per CPM that you are experiencing

95
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:08,710
right.

96
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,110
So then we have the cost per CPM now then we can also look at the acquisition costs full well for the

97
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,410
users we were spending on the ad so the acquisition costs is calculated right because were putting the

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,260
advertising costs there then how many customers we require per month divided by the total ad spend we

99
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,030
can have the cost per acquisition.

100
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,120
Now for partnerships its going to look something similar right for partnerships.

101
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,420
Maybe we're going to look at had hey how quickly are we going to be able to grow partnerships initially

102
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,010
we're going to be able to grow faster because your growth rate you're at a lower starting point so your

103
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,540
growth rate is going to be higher.

104
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,260
But over time maybe you have a lot more units you're going to grow much slower on a monthly basis.

105
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,540
Okay.

106
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,680
So we may start something where we're growing 10 percent a month and then we then get all the way down

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,190
to just growing 1 percent a month.

108
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:02,640
You know after three years in let's say we start off with a hundred initial locations partnership location

109
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,430
that's right.

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,520
So then starting with 100 that you sign on on day 1 and you can keep growing it right.

111
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,100
We can grow this user or this partnership while you're in development you should be building your partnerships

112
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,730
as you're doing your development and really you know growing the business right.

113
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,540
So you know you could do that or you can start smaller and start a little bit later as well for this

114
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:25,840
one.

115
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,590
We're assuming it starts early and then you're building over time.

116
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,910
So then by the time you launch your you have have a little bit more than you started with.

117
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,300
Okay.

118
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,300
And then after the launch it starts to slow down again in terms of its growth rate and we would grow

119
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,320
more slowly in terms of the partnerships now the partnerships are more involved you're going to have

120
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,310
to talk a little bit more.

121
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,620
So it may cost you more or you may have to hire someone to make all these calls and have multiple calls

122
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,550
to in order to convince a partner to sign on to be part of your network.

123
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,220
So we're going to just make an assumption around the acquisition costs here.

124
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,070
OK so every time we sign someone up then that's a new costs for the company after that.

125
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:09,190
Well we didn't have labor rights some other overhead So here we're using that same structure that we

126
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,710
did before we were tackling some of the headcount for different categories.

127
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,180
So maybe initially just two founders we don't have any of that.

128
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,290
We may have a late third founder ad and maybe some of if you have sales and marketing later some more

129
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:29,410
engineers to help with the coding so that the founders aren't doing as much later.

130
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:35,060
Whatever you are deciding in terms of your need for your team to build this.

131
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,500
OK.

132
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:42,280
So then we arrive that the headcount and then from the headcounts we can then also look at the schedule

133
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,760
of the comp..

134
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,120
So maybe the founders are willing to take a haircut at the beginning just to make sure they can extend

135
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,220
the runway over time.

136
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,190
Then they increase their compensation.

137
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,530
Okay.

138
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,800
So maybe the founders will increase the competition a little bit longer before they actually do that.

139
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,180
Okay.

140
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,080
Okay then with the compensation that's calculated and we can also look at other kinds of overhead.

141
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,760
So we have the per person per month costs.

142
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,580
You know we have this legal retainer if you want to factor that in.

143
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,090
And then any other monthly costs.

144
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,560
So this one is structured in such a way like to start in a certain month.

145
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,130
You know we may not want to have a lot of stuff kicking in yet.

146
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,430
Right.

147
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,800
So this is where you can add these other monthly costs.

148
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,630
Now once we have that we pretty much have all of the expenses and we have the revenues that was done.

149
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,980
So then in the next lecture we can put it together and see what it would look like based on our assumptions.
