00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,740
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,140
OK.

3
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,670
On with our first lecture where we cover strategic and tactical advice for making or models correctly

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,630
and saving your sanity in the process.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,930
This looks like we're going to talk about visualization and knowing how to tackle the first steps you

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,490
take.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,900
Whenever you start creating a new model are you familiar with the term writer's block.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,760
Well it's just the concept that writers or people who write frequently often run into intense periods

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,390
of limited productivity for whatever reason.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,180
They just cannot get their thoughts straightened out and uncharacteristically struggled to put words

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,050
on a page.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,700
That's why we call it writer's block.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,250
One of the most common times this happens is at the beginning of any project or piece of writing you're

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,300
presented with a blank canvas and unlimited direction you can take it and that seeming unlimited This

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,010
is what freezes you up.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,380
Ever notice how much easier it is to order from a restaurant that has a menu with five items on it versus

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,550
a restaurant with a menu with a hundred item on it.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,240
Well it's a paradox.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,930
More choice means more indecision.

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,860
Well there's a similar phenomenon in modeling when you first open your model ready to chart your path

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,860
to infinite financial wisdom.

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,890
It often takes you hours to get started because you know if you set up the structure of your model wrong

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,550
it's going to screw you up considerably going forward and down the line.

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,660
So how do we avoid this and how do we avoid that giant ball of anxiety that occurs when you first open

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,980
your excel sheet.

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:44,490
Well it's relatively simple and it's the first major tenant you need to follow that of always keeping

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,270
the end in mind.

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,320
It's not a question of which direction you should turn right now.

29
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,400
It's a question of what series of turns you have to take to get to your specific destination.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,630
It's often the lack of destination that throws everyone off so much.

31
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,200
And specifically with modeling when I say destination or know where you're going what I'm really talking

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,070
about is how is your model going to answer fundamental questions about your business.

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,430
From a practical standpoint here is what you do to always keep the end in mind.

34
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,870
Any time you ever put something into your model you should be doing it in order to answer a question.

35
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,160
Remember the lemonade stand example.

36
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,780
Every time we put something down on our page we were doing it in order to answer some specific question.

37
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,170
For instance how much do I need to sell my lemonade for to break even with the cost of ingredients.

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,530
When you frame it as a question then it's a lot easier to visualize what information we need to establish

39
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,010
and calculate in order to get the answer we need.

40
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,820
In that case we needed to figure out the costs of each ingredient the makeup and the total cost of the

41
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,570
drink.

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,770
And then finally what our profit expectations were based off of what we wanted to get paid.

43
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,590
So let's say you're opening up a brand new model and you want to model out your let's say e-commerce

44
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,350
business.

45
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,160
Well the first thing you're going to want to do is to shut down that program of Excel and just get out

46
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,030
a Word doc or a piece of paper ask yourself out loud why am I making this model.

47
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,250
Think about it for a little bit and then write down on a sheet of paper what questions you're trying

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,240
to answer by building it in the first place.

49
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,870
There are probably several things about your business you wish you knew in an e-commerce scenario.

50
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,470
We might want to know things like number one how much on average you shipping costs account for in our

51
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,240
overall cost structure.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,620
Number two what's the relationship between profitability and the size weight of your product as in.

53
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,550
Should I focus on lighter smaller objects to save on shipping or shipping.

54
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,850
Not that big of a deal.

55
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,250
Maybe you want to know how much you are paying or manufacturer and what your profit margin looks like

56
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,670
as you order more or less.

57
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,220
Remember the more you order theoretically are not all the time but usually the cheaper your units will

58
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,770
get.

59
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,840
By the way we will cover this when we talk about e-commerce modeling specifically.

60
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,780
Once you have your questions right now order them by priority put the crucial questions at the top and

61
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,390
the nice to know questions kind of at the bottom now why do we do this.

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,720
Well because number one you obviously want to get to these crucial questions sooner.

63
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,120
But number two more importantly it's actually more efficient to do it this way because modeling questions

64
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,340
often have dependencies.

65
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,830
Sometimes you can't answer this question before you answer this.

66
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,200
And sometimes if you answer this question you might have already done half the work for this other question.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,300
As you move down the list you might have done a lot of the work and you can minimize your time in it

68
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,260
and the less important questions.

69
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,430
Since we brought up dependencies I need to point out that you should try to be mindful of these.

70
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,320
Now what exactly do I mean by dependencies.

71
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:18,770
Well let's say I wanted to figure out my overall profitability next quarter if I introduced a new product.

72
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,310
Kind of like lemonade stand.

73
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,430
Would you like strawberry lemonade.

74
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:30,470
I can't exactly answer that question if I haven't even figured out what my profitability is this quarter

75
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,930
or next quarter.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,130
Even without the addition of the new product you have one foot in front of the other.

77
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,810
Otherwise it will trip.

78
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,390
So when starting your model think about where you're trying to end up that destination is probably the

79
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,070
answer to a question.

80
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,260
The first thing you generally want to do before you model is write out the questions you want to answer

81
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,040
in order by importance and dependency.

82
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,090
You should know what questions are more important to you and what you need right now.

83
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:05,120
If you're trying to raise capital and certain questions will be more important than if you are just

84
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,420
modeling out to say estimate the viability of a new retail location.

85
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,540
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
