00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.290
All right now that we have the revenue and the expenses figured out what we can do is we can start putting

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
it together in an overall cash flow summary here.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.900
So for this one we always want to start with the timing just have the months and then have the timing

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.420
of the start up period where the different parts of the ramp up period and then we pull then some sales

5
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.580
headcount that's coming from the revenue side.

6
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.660
So we see how fast we're growing the headcount You know I'm just going to get rid of this extra space.

7
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.040
Sometimes when I'm building stuff I leave some extra space there too just more room to work with.

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.120
But then when you're done just for for ease of looking at things this way it's easier to show it.

9
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.890
So here's the tough part here.

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.570
I mean do revenues first.

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.890
Right.

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.140
Same logic you know head count I have the phrase growth and the customer churn figures there.

13
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.070
So no whats going on there.

14
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.000
The total new bookings in annual contract values total contract value thats book for each of those months

15
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.990
sales attrition net new bookings.

16
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.590
Okay but annual contract value and then the actual monthly recurring revenue thats coming in is here

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.990
right so thats the new monthly recurring revenue for that month.

18
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.540
And then thats from the prior month.

19
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.610
Its first is smaller but then over time the recurring revenue from the prior months is going to be a

20
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.540
lot more than the total new monthly recurring revenue from that particular month.

21
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.750
Right.

22
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.290
So this is from our prior sales.

23
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.460
This is just from that month.

24
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.920
And then we have churn and then we have the net monthly recurring revenue Billings on the expense side.

25
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.660
You know this is just for clarity.

26
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.530
Weve also had assumed some other headcount.

27
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.520
Right so we can see like hey in this case you know pretty small team but half of it more than half is

28
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.220
going to be part of the sales team.

29
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.450
And then there's everybody else expense and salary growth.

30
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.900
This is just for inflation.

31
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.880
Whatever growth rates you assume and again when you're doing the summary all you should be doing is

32
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.900
pulling from the other sheets you're not supposed to be calculating any actual Right.

33
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.530
So you see that all of these formulas are just pulling from either the revenue sheet or the expense

34
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.230
sheet with the exception of the very end here where we're going to do some calculations.

35
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.350
This right here we have the startup period start up costs.

36
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.610
Okay.

37
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.740
And then the cost of sales because we said some like 80 percent gross margins so that means there's

38
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.930
some costs related to sales.

39
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.560
And then here is the sum of all the base salaries some of all the performance salaries additional sales

40
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.400
overhead costs of all the qualified sales leads.

41
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.690
And then here is then the total other compensation that's for the other hand count.

42
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.220
And as for other overhead and there's some other monthly expenses that kicks in.

43
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.880
So then when we add all those up together we have the total expenses were the net cash flow out.

44
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.090
Now when we put them together now we have the actual cash position per month so that we see that there's

45
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.690
a break even month in twenty nine months.

46
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.460
So it's going to operate pretty much at a loss for the first two years plus and then it starts to turn

47
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.740
a profit and turn around.

48
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.910
All right.

49
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.570
So then from there we can look at the cumulative cash position and then figure out what is the maximum

50
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.430
cash need or deficit.

51
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.540
Remember what we did for the start of worksheet.

52
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.720
Once we have the max cash deficit we pull it in here we can add another contingency to it and then that

53
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.150
becomes our total funding need.

54
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.510
So whatever the start of costs are then the working capital to get to the point where it can become

55
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.640
profitable and self-sustaining.
