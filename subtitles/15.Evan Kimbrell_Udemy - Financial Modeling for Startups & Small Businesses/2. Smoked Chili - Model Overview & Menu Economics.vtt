00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.760
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.350
We're going to do a little quick brainstorm.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.550
First for the smoke chili case study.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.500
All right when we're thinking about a restaurant here the some of the things that you may want to think

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.690
about as you go through the modeling process for a restaurant you're going to have to think about food

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.570
costs.

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.890
All right so part of the food costs is going to come from your menu items you're going to have different

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.700
menus.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.450
You may have different assumptions around what people are actually going to be buying.

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.630
You know and there's a learning process for a restaurant that means when you first open a restaurant

11
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.370
you're not going to be able to operate at 100 percent efficiency.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.520
You're going to have more ways you're going to have higher learning curves you're going to be less efficient.

13
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.340
So that means a lot of your costs early on are going to be higher than your target or your benchmarks.

14
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.330
But eventually you're going to get there.

15
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.440
All right so when we're thinking about benchmarks especially in terms of revenue this is one of the

16
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.750
cases where you do want to use industry benchmarks.

17
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.990
In the case of tech startups a lot of times you're doing something new.

18
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.140
You don't really have anything really similar to go off of mean you're going to have to find something

19
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.090
that may be similar or you do more of a market sizing right.

20
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.040
And do some sort of growth assumptions that we've done but for something like a restaurant where you

21
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.710
know this is a very known business model.

22
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.930
I mean you're not inventing something completely new your menu might be a little bit different.

23
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.330
You know your concept might be a little bit different but a restaurant category depending on what price

24
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.960
ranges and what size of your restaurant there is pretty well known benchmarks that the industry can

25
00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.870
give you in terms of expected revenue targets or you know how much you should be spending on labor or

26
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.210
food costs and things like that.

27
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.720
So how are we going to model this out.

28
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:16.480
We're actually instead of trying to do things like foot traffic coming to the restaurant and then and

29
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.580
then what percentage of them buys or sits down and then you know what are they buying.

30
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.000
What we're gonna do is a better way to do this is you find a benchmark and then look at how long it's

31
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.210
going to take you to get to that benchmark and stabilize that that mark and assuming some inefficiencies

32
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.050
early on this makes the process a lot easier and actually turns out to be more accurate and more useful

33
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.610
than to go about the other way so other things that you know we're going to be thinking about could

34
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.420
be the average ticket just this will help you understand kind of how many people you need to get through

35
00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.720
the transactions you may have to do in a given period of time just to see if you're in the right ballpark.

36
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.090
We're going to have to think about things like labor and labor deployment because well you know you're

37
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.260
going to have probably a salary manager and then you're going to have different hourly people who may

38
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.810
have an assistant manager and have you know hourly people that are working at different parts of the

39
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.080
day right.

40
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.210
Maybe during peak hours you're going to have a lot more people working then during off peak hours.

41
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.040
And then of course you know there's always going to be overheard things like rent and utilities and

42
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.860
we are also going to look at the startup costs as well.

43
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:44.370
The parts of getting the building out the restaurant and getting it ready for training and for the grand

44
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.190
opening.

45
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.960
OK.

46
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:54.540
One other thing that people don't think about before opening a restaurant type of business is this thing

47
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.960
called ramping up and honeymoon period.

48
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.420
We've looked at a lot of different business models for startups and we know that you don't just go 0

49
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.710
to 100 on day one.

50
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.320
It takes time to grow and build up.

51
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.540
Right.

52
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.030
And the same thing is true for brick and mortar businesses.

53
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.760
For a restaurant like that opening a restaurant means it takes time for you to get the word out there

54
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.390
for people to find out about your restaurant for you to slowly ramp up.

55
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.690
Now the other thing is there's a phenomenon called the honeymoon effect in restaurants where early on

56
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.850
when it first opens certain beers certain restaurant concepts will have a very distinct honeymoon period.

57
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.560
OK.

58
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.870
And for the Chipotle Restaurant OK which is something very similar to the smoked chili case that we

59
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:54.210
were doing a Jabali restaurants the new restaurants they tend to grow more slowly but then they ramp

60
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.550
up to a higher stabilize rate.

61
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.500
Now most other restaurants.

62
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.430
What happens is they ramp up very quickly to a high honeymoon sales and then they kind of slowly come

63
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.600
back down to stabilize rate.

64
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.870
So that's what we're going to assume here for smoke chili because not every restaurant is going to have

65
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.030
that kind of brand recognition.

66
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:26.460
You know even with the deam that Chipotle has taken in this past year with the whole food poisoning

67
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.170
fiasco they're still doing quite well from what you'll see in just a little bit.

68
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.950
OK.

69
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.450
So here's just kind of a quick brainstorm of the different elements of a restaurant business starter.

70
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.040
OK.

71
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.720
So first thing we're going to do is we're going to take a look at the average ticket size OK.

72
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.730
And the way we're going to do that is we're going to look at the menu here.

73
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.020
OK so we're going to have a really simple menu.

74
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.730
There's only three items here.

75
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.450
There's burrito there's tacos and then there's a salad and there's a price for it.

76
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.350
OK.

77
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.350
And then here is the cost of goods sold.

78
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.340
OK.

79
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.410
Basically all the ingredients including the paper products.

80
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.810
How much does it go into a single delivering the single burrito or this taco.

81
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.580
OK.

82
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.810
Now I provided some industry benchmarks for you.

83
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.950
This is courtesy of restaurant owner dot com.

84
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.660
And if you look at different sources they're going to be pretty similar.

85
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:36.400
I've been in the restaurant industry for a few years so do have some familiarity with the figures and

86
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.960
this is pretty much in line with what I was expecting to find.

87
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.880
Now the food costs.

88
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.230
OK.

89
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.430
So for each of these We're going to do the menu we're going to have three main items and then we're

90
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.800
going to have some add on maybe there's you know like an added walk guacamole to it or they can add

91
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.150
some extra meat and and there's beverages.

92
00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.420
OK.

93
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:06.890
Now for the main items everyone is going to buy at least one of these meat items if they're going to

94
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.300
go there and buy something they're going to buy one of these men and that's where we're going to assume.

95
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.640
But then only some of the people will have add ons you know eight percent of the people that buys anything

96
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.350
up here what get Quoc with it.

97
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:26.510
And then 5 percent will get the extra meat and then here is the percentage of people that actually buy

98
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.550
the beverages.

99
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.700
OK.

100
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:36.600
So when we have this information like this and this you're going to have to make a best guess you know

101
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.480
based on the menu that you expect.

102
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.190
OK.

103
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:49.130
Now you can be more conservative and add a little bit more padding to it but especially as you start

104
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:56.180
to operate or do some you know light opening you're going to be able to get a pretty good feel for what

105
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.410
your product mix is going to be what people are actually going to be buying.

106
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.240
But the more important thing is to know what kind of pricing you're going to charge and how much it

107
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.630
costs you to actually produce that item.

108
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.380
OK.

109
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:16.580
So then what that can give us then is the average order size of the typical customer this restaurant

110
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:24.300
concept it's going to be about a 50 and you know given that some of them are going to buy these higher

111
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.370
margin add ons and beverages.

112
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.300
The food costs are going to come down a little bit compared to the food costs of just the main items.

113
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:32.580
OK.

114
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:39.300
So so we have this information but like what we did with the lemonade stand example.

115
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.550
Not every person who comes in is going to come in alone.

116
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.790
Right.

117
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.600
So the average party size is going to be maybe closer to two people.

118
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:54.360
So when we make that assumption now we can get a sense of what is the average ticket ok per ticket value

119
00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:02.940
of a transaction that's coming into the restaurant it's about 14 54 to 46 and that's where the food

120
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.170
costs are.

121
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:09.930
So you can see if we just have a simple menu we can actually make some pretty good educated guesses

122
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.310
around what the average ticket size would be.

123
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:21.180
Now some industry benchmarks just see you guys can get some familiarity with with this.

124
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.930
Is that typically for food costs in the restaurant industry.

125
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:33.420
You know you try to target somewhere between 20 to 32 percent of sales where paper products make up

126
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.830
1 to 4 percent of sales you know different concepts will use different amounts.

127
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:42.660
So if you're primarily a take out on do a lot of take out you're going to have a much higher use of

128
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:48.240
paper products versus if you only pretty much do sit down and where most people just sit down and don't

129
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.200
order out or don't have a lot to take away.

130
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.530
Some other benchmarks that are important.

131
00:09:53.530 --> 00:10:01.740
Think about is occupancy costs generally as a restaurant you want to target your rents to be 6 percent

132
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:11.970
or less of your sales and total occupancy costs would be including taxes and insurance that would go

133
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.500
into that.

134
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:20.130
So for that when you want to target less than 10 percent of sales now payroll or labor is typically

135
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.880
the other big costs.

136
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.180
Okay.

137
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:31.050
So between food costs and labor those will make what is call your prime costs.

138
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.610
Okay.

139
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:39.890
So for labor you know depending on the type of restaurant if you're a full service restaurant you know

140
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.480
being a full sit down you've got somebody taking you to the tables and waiting on you and taking orders

141
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.340
at the table and everything you're looking at 30 to 35 percent for labor.

142
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:55.190
But if it's more of a limited service if you're kind of a fast casual then you know something more like

143
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.160
smoke chili.

144
00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:01.760
You're trying to target less than 30 percent for your labor.

145
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:07.660
And here's a breakdown of the labor generally you want your salaried manager to be less than 10 percent

146
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.540
of sales your enrollees total enrollees to make up 15 to 20 percent.

147
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.420
OK.

148
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:23.120
And benefits usually is somewhere around 5 to 6 percent of sales or 20 to 25 percent of your total payroll.

149
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:31.360
Now when you add up your COGS and your labor if it's a full service you want it to be less than 65 percent

150
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.200
of your sales.

151
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:39.850
If it's more of a fast casual or fast food you want it to be even lower than that maybe more like 60

152
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:40.530
percent.

153
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.110
OK.

154
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.870
In terms of performance.

155
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:51.570
One of the metrics that's used in industry for restaurants to measure sales performance is sales per

156
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.600
square feet.

157
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.810
So for how much space it is what does the sales per square feet.

158
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.430
In that given year.

159
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.430
And here are some metrics that they provide that are kind of interesting and I think it's a little bit

160
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.270
on the lower end but let's just go real quick.

161
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:13.790
So there's saying for a full service restaurant it is doing less than $150 in sales per square feet.

162
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.920
They're losing money.

163
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:21.090
And then if it's somewhere in this range to break even if it's over $250 it's start to make a profit.

164
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.130
And then over 350 They make a really good profit.

165
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.790
Okay.

166
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.960
And for fast casual quick service generally because they have a much smaller footprint.

167
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.920
So that's why the per square foot figures have to be higher.

168
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.310
OK.

169
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:43.960
So they have they have to do more sales get more out of the square foot feet that they have to give

170
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:51.500
you an idea the average size of a chipotle store is just under 2600 square feet.

171
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:51.830
Right.

172
00:12:51.840 --> 00:13:01.860
So what that means is for a Chipotle the store if it makes does less than 500000 sales it's losing money.

173
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.940
And for sure it is doing less and that is losing money.

174
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.360
I don't know if actually it can break even at 645 thousand.

175
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.110
You know this is assuming two hundred fifty mark even.

176
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.520
It's not really quite there.

177
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.170
I think it can start to make a profit at this point for sure.

178
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.590
And then you know obviously you make a bigger profit at this range.

179
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:29.350
But give me an idea of just how good of a restaurant Chipotle is.

180
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:35.390
You know for the average store size you know their average store in 2015 to 2.4 million in sales.

181
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:41.850
Now even with the food poisoning incident in 2016 their average store sales were still 1.9 million in

182
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.810
2016.

183
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:50.880
That means that their average sales per square foot were $930 in 2015 and 736 dollars per square feet

184
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.290
in 2016 definitely is performing way higher than industry averages.

185
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.900
You know in the same category.

186
00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.100
Right.

187
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.060
So that's why they've been doing very well and they're still very profitable despite issues in recent

188
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.200
years.

189
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.620
All right let's move on to the start of a worksheet.

190
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:21.510
So here we're going to assume this space of the same size as it or partly store for smoked chili restaurant.

191
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:27.090
Now here are some of the categories of start up costs for a restaurant.

192
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.860
Usually you're renting out a space and you're going to have some sort of security deposit that's usually

193
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.420
around two months rent.

194
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:41.030
We're picking a pretty decent location so we're going to have a pretty sizable security deposit.

195
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:47.950
And just give me an idea I'm thinking in terms of Los Angeles in Los Angeles for available retail restaurant

196
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.480
spaces less than $20 a square feet.

197
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.900
The locations are pretty crappy.

198
00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:00.690
But you know around 30 bucks you're kind of in the middle tier and if you're looking at $50 plus faces

199
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.410
you're kind of looking at prime downtown locations.

200
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.430
So that's pretty pricey here.

201
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.420
We're assuming something around the 40s.

202
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:09.910
Okay.

203
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:18.520
Now build out and fixtures this is something that you're going to have to do your research on.

204
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:23.210
You know depending on the content and really depending on what you want to put in there it can vary

205
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:31.430
a lot and generally what you'll see is that a lot of new restaurant entrepreneurs tend to overspend

206
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.550
on out fixtures they want to make everything pretty they overspend on a whole lot of things that you

207
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:44.360
know are very aesthetic but kind of puts them in a bad position 400000 for build out for a store size

208
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.520
like this is actually not that much.

209
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:52.070
In fact I think chipotle might be spending anywhere from six to seven hundred for their bill that potentially

210
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.950
because the stores do so well they can spend more on their bill that they can spend more and still get

211
00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:58.800
away with it for it.

212
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:05.150
But for kind of a mom and pop restaurants start up you're going to have to make sure you save wherever

213
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.880
you can.

214
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:13.790
Equipment and appliances you know depending on your concept and what you're buying you know if you're

215
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:19.700
if you're using some heavy equipment some specialized equipment you're going to have to pay more if

216
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:25.990
you have a lot of freezers and you need a bigger refrigerator storage refrigerator.

217
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.280
And you have lot of stuff that needs cold storage.

218
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:34.470
It's going to be more expensive furniture for something of this size.

219
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.170
That's a good estimate as a starting point.

220
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:46.040
You know this is not just finding super great deals but you're also not spending way too much into other

221
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.830
things you're going to have to spend money on your POS system.

222
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.530
That's called point of sales.

223
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:51.770
Right.

224
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:59.300
So you know it's a simple one you know register to register that check out.

225
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:04.160
This might be cheaper but if you're going to have something where it's connected to I-pads that people

226
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.100
can order and your associates can walk out and you know maybe you have a drive through or something

227
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.000
then and it might cost a little bit more.

228
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.770
Part of the startup costs too is you want to buy some initial food supplies because you might be doing

229
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:25.090
some you know soft openings for training also you're going to need some of that.

230
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.710
So there's permanent licenses signage.

231
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:36.470
You're going to have to do menus and you're you need a budget to do your soft opening employee training.

232
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:42.050
You can't just hire people and expect them to be able to work when you have a grand opening.

233
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.750
You've got to bring them on you know a few weeks beforehand and kind of run through the process and

234
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.680
train them and do a little run through with friends and family who are going to be ordering and eating

235
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:59.840
and so you get people in the kitchen to practice and people you know doing the orders and all of that

236
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.060
everybody gets a little bit of practice right.

237
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.680
And of course when you first open you're going to do a grand opening you're going to do a little bit

238
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.870
more marketing and trying to get get some attention.

239
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:14.180
Drive awareness so you want to set aside some budget for that as well as you know setting a little bit

240
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.110
aside for miscellaneous other things that you might have missed.

241
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:25.280
So that comes down to about six hundred twenty five thousand in this startup here.

242
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:31.410
But we know that you're not going to make money on day one you're going to be losing money for a few

243
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.030
months as you ramp up sales.

244
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.960
So we're going to need some working capital.

245
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.550
So this is going to be calculated later when you look at the full picture.

246
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.450
So next lecture going to look at revenue.
