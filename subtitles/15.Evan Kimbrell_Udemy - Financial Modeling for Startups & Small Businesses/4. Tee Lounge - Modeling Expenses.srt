1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,920
It Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,250
All right.

3
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,750
We're going to look at the cost side of things now.

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,650
So one of the things that we've got to do on the cost side of things is because it happens before we

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,130
actually open the grand opening date.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,680
So we looked at sales.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,850
Everything starts on month 1 August 1st.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,350
Now for the expenses we're looking at the build out before that.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,870
So this one I kind of did it backwards where we have Month 1 when it actually launches but then we start

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,390
working backwards that way.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:29,830
Okay.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,530
Now in terms of revenues we know that this is pulling in from the revenue side.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,220
All those sales that are coming in.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,470
Right.

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,460
Doesn't start happening until it opens.

16
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:44,370
So then we can look at okay so that's the sales and then any other taxes and other things that we need

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,310
to pay.

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,460
So that's all on the cash flow kind of in the then we started looking at other expenses all the cash

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,460
that's going out.

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,630
We've got some basic operating expenses payroll and some rent and other things that start to kick in

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,170
right like supplies marketing and all these other things we know you're not doing marketing while you're

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,490
building it out really you're not doing too much you might be doing some of that you could do a little

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,140
bit earlier but you want to do a slow launch right.

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,370
The first part so probably not going to do too much and then he would let word of mouth do that here.

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,350
Now there's something in this line and when you look at the years this is a revenue shift.

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,060
And then here is expense shifter and expense multiplier.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,600
What that is is actually something coming from summary page.

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,260
It's one of the things that I just want to let you see is a summary page is a summary of what all the

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:47,670
projected revenues are operating expenses the net operating income for years 1 through 5 debt service

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,810
coverage ratio and all over the debt service on the sims.

31
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,000
When it's break even.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,270
All of this is really great here it gives us an idea and here's the breakdown of revenue coming from

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,830
CMS versus coming from food and drink rights.

34
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,150
It gives a summary but by building in something called a revenue or expense if you get something like

35
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,060
this what if we increase revenues by 5 percent what would it look like.

36
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,370
So this makes it very easy to adjust changes at the summary level.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,290
This is a global shift in the revenue and this is a global shift in the expenses.

38
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,970
So you can kind of make that adjustment if nothing changes the revenue.

39
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,470
But if expenses suddenly get 5 percent more expensive right thing you see the operating senses change

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,360
and the like goes lower.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,420
So that is something that is actually very useful and it's quite easy to do because you can do that

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,000
at the very end of all your calculations once you have are able to sum everything up and have these

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,690
aggregate calculations for certain things for revenue or expenses into this global Shiff increases or

44
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,750
decreases it.

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,990
And so you see how it changes your overall calculations based on that.

46
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,600
So all right going back to this.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,230
So when we have all the expenses here.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,070
These are expenses and then we're looking at really our cash flow we also got to look at our startup

49
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,880
costs right.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,470
When are we spending the startup.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,120
So here here are all the start of base expenses of when they're happening.

52
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,620
And then the startup costs that are happening right now for those of you that are looking at this I

53
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,740
have a preference to primarily work with numbers that are just smaller so don't take up as much room

54
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,160
and some of the models we use just the regular numbers.

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,830
So this one is what I do personally is if it's going to be in bigger numbers or on thousands or just

56
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,140
working single digit numbers like this and just I know that these are all in thousands.

57
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,890
It just takes up less space on the screen.

58
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,570
Now you also see that you know I don't really format too much of these calculations sheets because this

59
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,470
is just for me an entrepreneur.

60
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,460
It's not being shared so much for investors.

61
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,830
But you know these are going to be formatted easier for reading and digestion.

62
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,280
Right.

63
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,050
So your calculation sheets it's just got to be clear you gotta know what you're doing.

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,580
You don't have to make it super pretty.

65
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:06,490
All right so once we have that now this this other part here is just looking at hey if it's being if

66
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:12,300
they're taking the equity investment and keeping track of that for the investors and then we're pain

67
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,110
that investors back what does it look like.

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,480
Right.

69
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,390
This part here is about treating the cash where there is a business account and actual checking account

70
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,670
for the business because in reality when the business makes money it doesn't magically gets distributed

71
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,500
to everybody right.

72
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,760
It's got to be held somewhere.

73
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,100
And and it would be distributed at different times and actually designated times.

74
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:41,040
So the best way to calculate the return of equity to investors is to actually calculate when they get

75
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,640
the cash.

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,360
They don't get it instantaneously every month when business cash comes in.

77
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,280
It has to be determined when it actually happens.

78
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,930
So that's what this is for.

79
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,680
This is if there's debt there additional debt that's being borrowed like a business loan.

80
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,990
This is later debt that we talked about in the front end and it's once you put all that together we'll

81
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:11,350
have net cash flow right net cash flow and then when we take the cumulative cash position then we know

82
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,660
what our max cash need would be.

83
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,980
And then we can see what that funding would be needed.

84
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:25,000
And then based on those figures there we can look at what the each year's aggregate figures look like

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,290
for revenue and splitting it between Sym and food drink revenue.

86
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:38,200
Operating expenses you know on debt payments what they look like what the is then this one is the income

87
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:45,370
sheet just to see if we calculated it factored in taxes with the depreciation what it would look like

88
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,120
what the Buddha would look like.

89
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,100
All right so there you go.

90
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,420
That's the cost side of things.

91
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,310
And and the next one will let's look at how it is summarized.
