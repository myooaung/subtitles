00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,500
Hey welcome back to the course and this lecture talk about the paper use business model.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:13,410
This is where a customer will pay for a product or service every time they actually use it.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,410
So think back to your first experience with iTunes when you found a song that you like 99 cents and

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,170
you pay for it.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,920
If you didn't want to buy anything then you didn't pay for it.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,670
So there are a lot of business models that are like this where it's on a pay per use basis at least

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,310
starting out.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,280
And then they may evolve into something a little bit more complicated.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:41,910
So in this lecture we're going to look at a pay per use model for a business where there is two types

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,180
of paper use class.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:52,380
One has a lower initial startup fee or setup fee with higher pay per user fee and the other plan has

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,270
a much higher set of fee but a much lower pay per user fee and in terms of modeling the revenue.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:08,100
What if the users within each of these plans also had a distribution in terms of their light usage or

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:16,770
medium usage or heavy usage because how often or how much they use determines the revenue that the business

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,830
is going to make.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,480
So how do we model something like that.

17
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,290
Let's take a look.

18
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,780
All right let's look at a business that gets a bunch of their potential customers of first do trials.

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,210
It's a product that takes a little bit of a learning curve.

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,590
People need to use it to really get comfortable with that.

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,150
You know maybe they give a one month free trials and then out of the users that do the trials some of

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,690
them become paying customers in some of these users are going to choose Plan A.

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,860
Well some of us are going to choose Plan B.

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,190
Now the difference between the two is one plan has a low set fee but a high per use fee and the other

25
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,790
one has the exact opposite.

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,270
A high set up fee and a low per user fee.

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,500
So one thing we can look at when we have these two plans like this is we can sort of see what it would

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,210
look like in order for them to break even.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,480
Right.

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,640
What kind of usage or how many uses would it take for both of these to break even.

31
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,720
So the way we're going to do that is we're going to do a simple test here here or we're going to calculate

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,310
the cost of the plan for a given use.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,570
Right.

34
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:40,020
So when I say Berty Okay now if is 30 usage under Plan A the customer would pay 5:49 under Plan B they

35
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,070
would pay 6 49.

36
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,400
So there's a difference here of 100 and the way we can solve where there are exactly the same at what

37
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:54,830
usage they would be break even with each other is use something called Gool seek and what we do is we

38
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,940
go to data go to data and there is a what if scenario.

39
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,340
In excel under analysis and there's a thing called Gool seek when you hit go see you're going to see

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:12,150
a dialogue like this is going to be a set sell part the sell part is the sell the result that you want

41
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,230
to change.

42
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,820
So in our case we want to change just breakeven number here.

43
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,150
That right now has a difference of 100.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,800
I want to set it to zero.

45
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,860
So when it's at zero it means planning and plan B are equal to each other and the so we're going to

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,730
change is the uses.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,940
So what it does is it's going to go through several iterations and finds that out like but it does it

48
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,020
instantaneously.

49
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,020
And so we find that at a usage of 40 that's when they're the same.

50
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:46,830
And this is good to know if you're testing between you know two or three plans because you want to make

51
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,730
sure that you price it in such a way where the brake usage breaks makes sense.

52
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,030
Right.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,220
If almost nobody gets to the for the usage and it doesn't really matter where you set the plan B.

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,580
Right.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,800
So you've got to set it in a way where it actually makes sense with what you think the users are going

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,420
to be doing.

57
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,610
So let's take a look.

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,370
So let's assume that plan a customers has this kind of usage distribution you know the vast majority

59
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,660
just uses it about 10 times.

60
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,890
You know there's a few power user that end up using it more than 40 times.

61
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,800
But the vast majority will use less than 40 times.

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,750
Makes sense right.

63
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,860
Because if they're using more than 40 times they probably are going to move to the next plan.

64
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,840
Plan B usage is for power users they're going to be primarily most of them are going to be using it

65
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,590
over 40 uses.

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,250
And there's a few of them that go to Plan B thinking they're going to use a lot more but end up using

67
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,930
a little bit less than optimal so they end up paying a little bit more than they would have if they

68
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,550
stay with plan A.

69
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:51,150
So here these are all we need to do for each of these plans is a distribution that adds up to 100 percent.

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,730
How we want to distribute.

71
00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:00,240
And what is the average usage in each of these groups and you can create as many as you want here at

72
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:00,700
5.

73
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,590
I mean you could do too you can do three.

74
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,910
It really doesn't matter.

75
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:11,770
You can set as many as you want but I probably wouldn't do much more than 5 4 for dividing or segmenting

76
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:19,360
your users within a particular planner or product line unless you have data that can that are that granular

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,320
for you to use.

78
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,730
OK.

79
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:28,140
So when we have this 10 weeks we can calculate the revenue by plan within each of these groups.

80
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,500
Right.

81
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,690
And then if we suck them up then we have the revenue totals for each of the plants which we did here.

82
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,310
So this one is just all these plans and this one is for the Plan B.

83
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,320
Now the big thing here is we also added calculative set of fees fears.

84
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,290
First set of fees is just going to be the number of customers in that plan times a set of fee.

85
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,800
Okay.

86
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,000
Pretty straightforward right.

87
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,120
And then we add it all up.

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,940
So this one what it does when you do something like this in terms of sanity check is it helps you kind

89
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,790
of lay out your structure for your model when you do want to model things out.

90
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,510
Okay so let's see what that would look like if we start to model this out over time.

91
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,990
All right.

92
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:14,220
So now we have something that is mapped out for say 12 months.

93
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,900
Let's assume that these are the monthly trials that the business is getting in a given month.

94
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,620
Okay.

95
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,310
And we have a certain conversion rate.

96
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,990
So there's a certain number of customers that they're getting right.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,200
And you know what let's make sure these customers are around are rounded to the nearest whole number

98
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,430
because otherwise partial customers don't really make sense right.

99
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,450
I went around these all to something.

100
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,260
Now you may see something happening here that's changing right.

101
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,650
What I'm doing here is I want some numbers here that aren't just straight flat number.

102
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,620
Maybe I think that overall they're going to get on average around 2000 trials.

103
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,790
But I wanted to fluctuate randomly between eighteen hundred and twenty two hundred.

104
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,220
So that's what's happening here.

105
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:10,790
It's random numbers being generated and then we're taking 15 percent of those as converted customers.

106
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,910
OK so now this set up here is coming from the front right we got our two plans and we've got the breakdown

107
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:24,670
between the customers so we can start calculating how many users or customers are in each plan in the

108
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,820
plan A.

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:33,010
What we do is we take the percentage there and then we multiply by the total number of customers and

110
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:40,700
we're again going to round down just so we have whole customers going to make that much of a difference.

111
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,640
But you know it will allow you to feel better.

112
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,110
Okay.

113
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,320
So we have that and then can copy the formula across.

114
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,870
Now we have the total number of uses for each plan.

115
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:57,580
The next thing we need to know is we need to have the cumulative number of users right now in the first

116
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:57,940
month.

117
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,140
It's going to equal to that.

118
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:05,350
So for some of you if you don't like these numbers changing each time what you can do is once you use

119
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,270
it you can just copy this whole thing and then you place value.

120
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,110
So you just keep to that particular set of rendah values.

121
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,550
Now when you do calculation calculations it doesn't keep changing.

122
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,050
Now for the second one is same as what we did before where we take the previous month plus the new month

123
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,390
right.

124
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,980
And we did the same for here for Plan B and then we have these calculations now the cumulative number

125
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,280
of customers in any given month.

126
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:39,310
So let's start with calculating the activation fees for activation fees are only when new customers

127
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,920
are activated.

128
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,090
Right.

129
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,190
So make sure you don't use the cumulative numbers.

130
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:52,000
So we're going to take the new users times the activation fee for each of the plans right for Plan B

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,180
we have the new users here times a plan B activation fee and then what we can do is we can calculate

132
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,580
it for the rest of the cells here.

133
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,150
All right.

134
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:08,550
Now remember we had the usage groups by how often they use the app.

135
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,870
So let's first calculate the number of users within each of these user groups and then we calculate

136
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,420
the revenue and then we're going to repeat the same process for Plan B and then we can start looking

137
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,280
at all of the combined revenues.

138
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:28,090
Okay so the usage groups here is going to be the percentage to the Leffe times the number or the cumulative

139
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:32,140
number of users in Plan A.

140
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,160
So now we've got to make that reference there and after a while you're going to get pretty comfortable

141
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,510
with all this.

142
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,950
Now this here you can round down again if you feel more comfortable with that.

143
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:49,150
So now here in these groups the total usage is going to equal to usage times the number of users that

144
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,170
are using that that much times the per use fee.

145
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,180
We've got this here now we have the revenue for Plan A.

146
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,820
Depending on which group of usage they're in you know you could do the same for Plan B and B times the

147
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,090
cumulative time B users get nice like whoops the wrong reference here.

148
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:16,820
This one I set the row as a solid reference when in fact it should be the column right.

149
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,870
So after a while you can't you can spot check it.

150
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
I know they shouldn't be forced.

151
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,480
Right.

152
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,220
Should be different.

153
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,210
So that's why when I copied it and it looked different it didn't look right.

154
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,450
You know you can visually do your error checking as well.

155
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,280
That looks right.

156
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,700
OK.

157
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:41,550
So let's then do this one times the number of users times the per use fee for plan B.

158
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:48,230
And now we have the revenues for each of the plants.

159
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,300
And so we take the all of the plan a total revenue.

160
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,220
What would it be then it would be the total activation fees that month plus the sum of all of the per

161
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,790
user fees for that month for planning for plan B.

162
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,580
It would be the equivalent right.

163
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:14,890
The total activation fees plus the sum of all of the subscription fees under Plan B that should be of

164
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,470
be there.

165
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,580
OK so now that we have those two well we can have it then.

166
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,670
All right what are the total activation fees.

167
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,410
Sometimes it's good to separate your revenue out in different ways.

168
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,950
Just so you can visualize that.

169
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:37,530
So this one will just be these these two teams and the total usage revenue will be the sum of the both

170
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,630
of the usages right.

171
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,610
So it was some's.

172
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,330
You can do.

173
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,650
You can put a whole array in there and then add another array.

174
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,700
This is called an array or a group of numbers and you could just put both of them in the formula and

175
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,900
what we would do is so some all of the components.

176
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,290
Now it can kind of break it down.

177
00:11:53,310 --> 00:12:00,660
I can see plant a person versus plan B and I can see activation versus usage revenue.

178
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,620
Pretty helpful.

179
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,440
And what we should see is that if we sum them all up any of these two we should get the same as the

180
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,850
sum of these two.

181
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,310
Right.

182
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,060
So we can take that we can use either of those to add the total.

183
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,480
We'll just use the nearest ones.

184
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,410
And so it's easier.

185
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,720
And now we have the total revenue per month.

186
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,870
So there you go.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,780
We have a model here that has two plans where it has a pay per use and there is some activation fees.

188
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:36,090
Now you may not like the colors that I'm using here but what it does visually is I can know which ones

189
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,180
are related to plan B or Plan A just by looking at this right.

190
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:47,310
I know that the blue this is plan A plan A you know this is for a plan a total and the same for the

191
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:47,960
purple's.

192
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,380
So you can choose whatever you want.

193
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:56,610
I find that using colors can make it easier for you to see even if the colors aren't the prettiest.
