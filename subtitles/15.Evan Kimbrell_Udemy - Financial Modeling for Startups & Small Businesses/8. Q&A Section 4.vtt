WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.480
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.440
Hey So we're going to do another Q&amp;A session.

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.450
Just me and Simon we're going to talk about Section 4 and then we're going to branch off into more general

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.610
questions that we just thought were interesting and you guys might find interesting as well.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.380
So Evan you know as a VC you probably seen so many financial models and I'm sure you've seen plenty

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.100
of those clichÃ© hockey stick growth models so when are looking at that what makes it believable or not

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.860
believable.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.720
Well Simon is referring to when he says hockey stick is the stereotype of a startup is that like it

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.410
grows it grows it grows and then it figures something out and it goes a little fast and it goes straight

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.760
up.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.390
Right.

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.660
And a lot of companies have grown like hockey sticks.

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.870
But nowadays it's even rarer but people have kind of come to the stereotype of like they just assume

14
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.540
they have to show hockey stick growth.

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.870
Otherwise it's like why would I invest in this.

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.510
And then I had to deal with like the function of how venture capital works.

17
00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.470
Remember venture capital is based off of betting on home runs not on batting singles and doubles.

18
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.940
I don't care if you accept 50 million.

19
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.040
They only care if you get access in the billions.

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.970
So with regards to showing growth it's I think there's two points.

21
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.650
One is yet to be cognizant of your industry right like this is not 2006 and 2007 where anything a venture

22
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.880
capitalist investing in was consumer Web right.

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.720
Like we are only investing in like dot com and YouTube and things like that.

24
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.000
And if you're an online business that's purely online selling digital goods then I generally would expect

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.950
hockey stick growth because your expenses don't scale in the same way that your user growth does.

26
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330
You can have a user for zero.

27
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.610
So you know if you if it's on a system that automates that whole thing why wouldn't I see revenue just

28
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.160
go up and to the right as you get something that works more and more.

29
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.140
I mean you are offering a business on the Internet is like the most efficient way you can possibly do

30
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.120
something and that's why so many people are going to software that's why we see software companies go

31
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.700
from zero to a billion in a year a year and a half it's crazy.

32
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.820
So one be cognizant of your industry if you're in software.

33
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.150
Yeah I do expect hockey stick growth.

34
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.510
I expect some very fast rate of growth.

35
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.380
But now nowadays we invest in a lot of different things.

36
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.650
Right.

37
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.500
Like if you're a food delivery business or you're doing something with farms are you doing something

38
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.050
with energy.

39
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.330
These are all venture capital targets now.

40
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.660
And if that's the case.

41
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.660
No don't show hockey stick like that doesn't make any sense.

42
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.670
Like if you're building cars you're going to grow the hockey stick rate because every time you build

43
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.800
a new car you need a new employee and you can't scale that quickly.

44
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.200
You can't just wake up one day and be like Wow we grew by a factor of 10.

45
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.070
It just you can't structurally grow that fast so if you show me up into the right and you're hurtin

46
00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.610
food or some of the things that are sexy now like hardware or physical product businesses and you showing

47
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.510
that I'm just going to say like no B.S. and most people are going to say you don't understand your industry

48
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.680
well enough.

49
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.250
And the other point I was going to say is that like we say hockey stick and you go up the right.

50
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.800
Like huge growth you know technically that's just a function of the scale of the graph.

51
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.090
Right.

52
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.440
So like if I'm looking at a graph and let's say you have really lame growth like it's like really and

53
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.160
moving up to the right and that's you see that on a 10 year scale Well what happens when you zoom out

54
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.940
to 40 years or 50 years.

55
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.360
Well guess what it's going to look like a hockey stick.

56
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.880
It's always going to look like that.

57
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.590
So that's one thing to keep in mind like don't get stuck on this design in any situation if you zoom

58
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.250
out enough.

59
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.890
It's always going to look like that.

60
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.000
It's just some businesses you know will take eight years to get to a significant amount of growth and

61
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.500
some take two.

62
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.610
So just be aware of that don't get stuck on.

63
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.080
I have to show extreme growth very quickly because it's all just a matter of the timeframe you're looking

64
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.460
at.

65
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.920
So we covered user attrition rate and attrition is kind of a generic term for you lose customers.

66
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.030
In SAS we call it churn churn is like what 100 people subscribe.

67
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.470
And at the end of the month 20 people drop out cancel our subscription that's 20 percent churn churn

68
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.830
is like a number that if you're in SAS you live and die by it.

69
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.740
What do you see people do incorrectly the most or most commonly when they're trying to model up their

70
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.560
attrition.

71
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.610
One of the things that I see if you make a mistake with churn or attrition in the beginning especially

72
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:46.980
with the models is they assume that whatever they're using is going to be accurate for their projection

73
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.920
you know whether even if they had a period of time where they have some users maybe they have launched

74
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.850
it in like a private beta and got some got some some data to base it on.

75
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.920
A lot of times it can be very different.

76
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.360
Their actual attrition can be very different so it's something that you definitely want to track very

77
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.970
closely rather than use and assume that you know whatever you have is correct.

78
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.430
Yeah.

79
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.100
And as I say one thing I've seen is people are too optimistic with their attrition and what they'll

80
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.260
do is they'll say like you talked to the beta group right.

81
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.530
Like a lot of people use their beta statistics and that's not a great way of modeling out the long term.

82
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.340
But people do the opposite where they'll be like my beta attrition was 10 percent.

83
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.060
OK.

84
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.970
But then I know that we're going to release V-1 in June and the ones to be so much better that our attrition

85
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.030
is going to 4 percent.

86
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.420
And V-2 is going to be like the best thing ever made.

87
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.210
We're going to be competing with like slack and Skype and attrition going 1 percent.

88
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.800
And like it's just not true it's just told don't do that.

89
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.700
You don't know what your product is going to look like.

90
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.280
You don't know your launch date.

91
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.390
And just by saying that at least for a venture capital perspective just by saying that you know definitively

92
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.050
what your attrition is going to be that makes me think that you don't know what you're talking about

93
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.120
because no one can know that stuff.

94
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:12.470
So with attrition I generally prefer to see people being pessimistic because I see a model where you

95
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.320
have significant attrition and it doesn't just go away magically and your numbers still make sense and

96
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.350
you still grow then that's a very good indication.

97
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.680
All right.

98
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.420
And second another question for you.

99
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.250
What if someone is in between two different revenue models like completely different revenue models.

100
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.980
And you know they're not sure which one that they're going to go with how should they think about it

101
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.710
in terms of their financial model.

102
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.380
Yeah Ira that you might not agree with this but I mean I don't see the problem in modeling too.

103
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.010
So you know do you think are going to be subscription anything going to be one time upfront sale like

104
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.130
a license then model both of them.

105
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.000
I mean it takes an extra hour hour and a half you know.

106
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:59.450
And the reason also I say that is because if you do both oftentimes you'll answer the question for for

107
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.110
yourself.

108
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.390
You know you were like I don't know if I want subscription or or a one time purchase.

109
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.180
Well it's a hard decision just sitting here right now and the time it is now we can't see the future.

110
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.330
But if the model both of those out you might actually see that one is clearly better than the other

111
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.760
and it's way easier to understand and it makes sense with how your product is structured.

112
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.510
If you guys skip ahead to the case study really went over my startup called scholar Pro we were looking

113
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.790
at our model that we use to raise our second round of capital.

114
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.190
We switched our model over and over and over again because we just didn't know which one we thought

115
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.430
made the most sense.

116
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.550
And it wasn't really actually till after we made that model that we modeled out everything we looked

117
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:47.120
at like what if everyone pays us yearly What if everyone pays us monthly and then what if like the schools

118
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.570
visit makes us just watched the case study what are the schools pay for the users instead.

119
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.390
Well once we model that out we're like wow.

120
00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.110
Users are schools paying for the users is extremely slow growth.

121
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.900
It's extremely unrealistic to think they're going to go fast with that yearly doesn't make any sense.

122
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.770
That was another thing we found is just like we model it out we're like that just doesn't it doesn't

123
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.850
make sense with the product we're offering is and so we ended up with the monthly one which is by far

124
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.500
the best.

125
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.370
Now I completely agree and I think you know you should definitely model both of them out just don't

126
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.170
do it at the same time do one and then do the next read out right away so you can look at both.

127
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.410
All right.

128
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:30.890
So have you ever seen a situation bringing this up because it occurred to me recently where you saw

129
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:37.790
business make a business decision based purely off of how that decision will affect their model and

130
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:43.320
not their actual business revenue profit the general health of the business.

131
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.400
I'll give you example.

132
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.680
We're working on this thing called Evins perks.

133
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.960
Right.

134
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.150
And if you guys are watching this like a month from now you'll know what I'm talking about.

135
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.010
But what it is is I'm going to companies and saying hey I have 110000 students.

136
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.180
Why don't you give us an exclusive discount for my students and then I'll incentivize them to try out

137
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.810
your service.

138
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.440
Right because software is inexpensive right but if you give me three months free well then yeah I'll

139
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.670
try it out.

140
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.460
And what I found is some people will say no.

141
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.260
And again I should preface this.

142
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.910
The reason why this is kind of ridiculous is that like we're only talking about SAS companies.

143
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.990
So I'm going to a company like Kanva or a company like into it with their quick books like their online

144
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:34.720
subscription cookbooks or zero dot com or like spy fu or ACM rush all these companies kiss metrics though.

145
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:43.490
And for them to add another user cost them literally nothing like it's just 0 0 0 0 0 1 if anything.

146
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:49.140
So me saying Give us a discount and I'll give it to 100000 students.

147
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.680
It should be free money right.

148
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.070
Because for them it does.

149
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.870
It's going to cost them anything to offer this for free to let these students dip their toes in the

150
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.650
water.

151
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:03.410
What I found is people are saying no not because they don't they hate money but because what's going

152
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.680
to do is it's going to ruin their metrics for when they go and try to fundraise.

153
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.030
Right.

154
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.830
So if I'm trying to model the revenue growth reduce source modeling.

155
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.840
Right so you going to say well the revenue from this group of people that I got from Facebook ads is

156
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.550
probably to look like this right because Facebook adds 50 percent of people are going to sign up.

157
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.790
OK well if I sponsor events what's it going to look like.

158
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.530
Well it's you know 40 percent are going to sign up.

159
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.730
Well they're saying no because they say like well what if your source only 10 percent of people sign

160
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.300
up.

161
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480
And then one ends up having it.

162
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:43.130
What ends up happening is I have to merge those three together making my 45 percent Sign-Up look more

163
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:49.630
like 20 something and that's going to make my business look less aesthetic in general when I then joke

164
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.740
try to fundraise.

165
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.950
It's really bizarre.

166
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.810
Like they're literally saying no to free money because it's going to make their model look less perfect

167
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.920
when they try to raise money.

168
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.020
Yeah it just I don't know I can't believe it's blows my mind but have you ever seen anything like that.

169
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.130
No I'm not that I can think of.

170
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.530
That's a great example.

171
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.210
Yeah.

172
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.690
I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.

173
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.950
Yeah and there's really nothing from like a sales standpoint you can like argue with that like I don't

174
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.040
I don't know what our subscription rates are going to be so mad.

175
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.860
Good luck with your fund raise I guess.

176
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.710
Like it just seems to me that profit and revenue are at the end of the day are more important what should

177
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.800
I have had was.

178
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:32.690
What are any like techniques you see people use to effectively cook their books and their financial

179
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.380
models.

180
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.460
So when you make a financial model you're trying to be as honest as possible.

181
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:42.660
But if you're working with yourself or your team or is trying to raise money or are trying to get acquired.

182
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.080
Have you seen anybody use common techniques to make it look rosier than it really is.

183
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.430
Yeah.

184
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.470
You know I think one technique is for people to keep two different models one for their own use and

185
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.610
then one for presentation to the outside world.

186
00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.780
And you know when you're presenting a motto usually like if you're presenting it to investors you're

187
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:08.120
not going to walk them through the inner workings of your model and give them a peek under the hood

188
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.800
they're not going to be interested in that anyways.

189
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.990
They're going to be interested in your assumptions and then they want to see your results.

190
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:20.540
So what happens then is underneath the hood is a lot of opportunities to fudge things.

191
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:27.020
If somebody wanted to I guess I'd push back a little bit on the whole like having books for yourself

192
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.390
and then books for external viewing.

193
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:37.280
Just because we exist kind of in an environment where investors at least from venture capital standpoint

194
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.030
are just unrealistic like it's ridiculous some of the things that they expect to see.

195
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.140
And it's a function of how screwed up venture capital is like we only look for Facebook's and group

196
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:52.700
bonds but we'll totally pass over a business that totally makes sense but can only make $50 billion

197
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.620
or 100 million dollars.

198
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:59.720
So it kind of makes sense that like on an internal level as an operator there are certain assumptions

199
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.100
that I care about that an investor wouldn't care about.

200
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:08.690
But then also like it makes more sense for me to be pessimistic in my internal models because that's

201
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.040
easier to operate with just assuming my attrition is going to be higher assuming problems are going

202
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.230
to happen whereas if we're being truly honest it's not necessarily realistic.

203
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:22.180
And we're doing yourself a disservice by using that as our external model.

204
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.440
Obviously I think other people might disagree.

205
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.670
You kind of have to make decision when you get to it.

206
00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.710
But one thing I was going to say is and venture capital especially one thing I've seen people do to

207
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:40.460
to cook their models is they take all the things that are not explained on the sheet and they mess with

208
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.070
those.

209
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.360
Right.

210
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.420
So one of the things we care about is how big is your addressable market.

211
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.920
Right.

212
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.890
Your decimal market could be $100 million.

213
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.860
It could be a million dollars.

214
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.740
It could be a billion.

215
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.690
Well oftentimes what they'll do is in their models will say in the first five years we're in a good

216
00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.410
20 percent market penetration.

217
00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:02.590
20 percent market penetration of million dollar market is $20 million of a billion it's 200 million.

218
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.520
And of a million to 200000 there's a tolerably different number.

219
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.220
Well what they'll do is they'll just feed in that number as an assumption they'll be like oh yeah our

220
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.880
markets totally 2 billion.

221
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.460
And if I'm just looking at the model I'm not going to notice that like I'm not going to notice that

222
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:21.410
you just assume your total dressup market's huge because that's usually a calculation you do on the

223
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.100
side or you do and your paycheck.

224
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.220
So I've seen that a lot.

225
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.140
People will be like you our markets 10 times larger than it really is because in a model it's not really

226
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.370
obvious that that's what they've done.

227
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.110
That makes sense.

228
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:39.010
Evan often you see VBA used in financial models like is it overkill.

229
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:44.430
I think generally especially for startups and entrepreneurs is it's overkill.

230
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:50.710
You can do so many things without having to ever touch VBA unless you know maybe maybe you want to build

231
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.490
a flight simulator in Microsoft Excel.

232
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.530
You might want to look at that.

233
00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.960
VBA is visual basic.

234
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.760
What's the A.

235
00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.600
I don't even know.

236
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:08.320
So basically excel you know it's like cheats so excels but you can run calculations and do really basic

237
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.060
programming in the back end.

238
00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:17.200
So with VBA I've seen one thing I've seen that's really useful is that people will build in actual data

239
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.990
into their model so they're not manually updating all the time.

240
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:26.470
Right so like if I get 10 new customers and my software I can totally feed that number into a database

241
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.700
somewhere and into my Excel sheets don't keep updating it and it's pretty cool because you share with

242
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.100
someone and they see it moving in real real time.

243
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.200
That's pretty cool.

244
00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.800
But generally yeah VBA is pretty excessive.

245
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.050
I don't think it helps you answer questions that you otherwise wouldn't have.

246
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:48.160
It might make you more accurate but then the question is like does it make you two percent more accurate

247
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.460
to 2 percent matter.

248
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:54.430
Yeah I think it's generally overkill unless you have an interest in exploring it.

249
00:15:55.210 --> 00:16:00.480
There's a concept in lean startups called the one metric that matters.

250
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.240
And if you guys there might be course we talked about this.

251
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:10.450
There's a lot of companies around nowadays that have this paradigm of like when we grow our company

252
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.580
it doesn't make sense to track 16 different things and focus on gross margins.

253
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.980
Our total a day over day increase in revenue and all these other metrics you can collect.

254
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.710
They only care about one singular metric at a time.

255
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.940
So that's why it's called One metric that matters.

256
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:33.640
So if I'm at a software company that does subscriptions like a SAS company we might say look we look

257
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:40.570
at our revenue growth and say you know the only thing that matters is how many people sign on to the

258
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.760
Pro Plan to the enterprise plan.

259
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.620
We might say only it matters is our churn rate how many people fall out the bottom because of returns

260
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.540
low enough will always grow.

261
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.250
Is that something you've seen people build into their models and if you haven't.

262
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.210
Is it something you think is a good idea or is it or is it just kind of to I.

263
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:05.950
I think that that concept is more about trend like post-launch and tracking the progress that you're

264
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:06.760
making.

265
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:12.940
And you know that that makes sense to me in terms of like the modeling itself.

266
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:18.640
You could still look at that metric of where you know maybe set it as a target of where you want to

267
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:25.420
get to and then back everything else calculate everything and derive everything else from that where

268
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:32.170
you know if churn is the biggest thing you know even then you can look at OK well what is the maximum

269
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:39.010
churn that we can have during the growth period that we want to have and then based on that what would

270
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.090
then what with our revenues look like then what would our expenses look like where would our profits

271
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.860
look like you know everything else becomes secondary as it makes sense.

272
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:52.480
I guess what you choose to optimize really doesn't necessarily reflect itself on the financial model

273
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.100
but yeah you can build it the model around the thing that matters most.

274
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:03.730
Question for you how married to your model do you think you should be like Is this a rough guideline

275
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.970
like you just did as an exercise and you should never check it again.

276
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:11.550
On the other side of spectrum is it not only a financial model.

277
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:17.740
It's like a benchmarking tool for your organization because I know people who I sort of got they don't

278
00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.570
even talk to their customers they just stare at their model all day long and they're like well I've

279
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.880
projected 10 percent growth next month.

280
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.410
So once I hit 10 percent growth next month I'm done for the month.

281
00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:34.080
I've seen people who build it like it's like their bible they have to follow every single stage of it.

282
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.850
Now like people that follow the Bible do that anyway.

283
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:42.820
But is that a problem or are people just looking way too much into the model and using it kind of as

284
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.780
an excuse to get away from the more subjective aspects of their business.

285
00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:52.390
You know I think there's a agree with you I think there's definitely a risk there and I've seen a lot

286
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:58.420
of entrepreneurs do this sometimes once they get into creating a model they can just get a little too

287
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:04.520
crazy about it and they get absorbed with the model itself more than actually building their business.

288
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.470
And that's where there's can be a real danger there.

289
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:12.490
And I think you got it when you build your model you get to decide what that model's purpose is for.

290
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:17.090
So if you're building it to raise funding then you build it and if you're successful at raising funding

291
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.780
you may not have to look at that motto again.

292
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.570
You achieve your goal with that but if you're building it as a rough guide to benchmark yourself to

293
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.150
see aright.

294
00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:31.480
You know I'm going to look at whether we can hit that target in three months and in three months you

295
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.780
see how you're doing against what you thought it was then you could make.

296
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.820
You can adjust your benchmarks afterwards and you have a different purpose for your model there.

297
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.830
The other mix on one question I've been asked and this is just what I want to touch on really quickly

298
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:53.650
was at what point in time in your business does your CFO or your CEO or someone else other than you

299
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.470
the business owner founder take over your model.

300
00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.880
You know because the thing is I've seen situations where there's founders and they had 200 people in

301
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.250
their company and they're still the ones who go into Google sheets and update their model every time

302
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.120
something changes.

303
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.130
So the question is look when is a good time to hand that off generally.

304
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:17.230
You know I see financial modeling as a from a Founders perspective as important up until the point where

305
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:23.440
you literally have someone who's in charge of numbers and projections and things like that because unless

306
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.120
you are just a finance person and that makes you feel better about it you're really kind of doing organization

307
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.810
a disservice if you have someone who is in charge of money and projections and time and all that stuff

308
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:39.090
and you don't let them put that into their in their wheel house or into their sandbox or whatever.

309
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.190
Whatever it is that they work on.

310
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.530
So yeah I think you're doing a disservice at that point.

311
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.320
But in general I generally see it happen.

312
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:51.640
You know when you when you have someone who's in charge of finances which usually does not happen until

313
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:58.370
your second round of funding or maybe even your third and I also see people you know when they see companies

314
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:03.130
that after they're done fundraising they don't really keep a model anymore which is a little nuts because

315
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.560
later you going to make it anyway when you get bought or axid or whatever.

316
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.360
But yeah I mean generally that's when I think your baby leaves home and goes to college probably around

317
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.130
like the second and second and third fund raise during that.

318
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.010
No not really.

319
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.010
I think you hit on all the good points.

320
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.020
Last question.

321
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.390
It's the concept of inflection points.

322
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.130
Right so we're talking about growth revenue go through the growth.

323
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:32.740
What an inflection point is if you aren't familiar is when you say you have a chart or a process or

324
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:42.040
something and it goes in a fairly predictable pattern or line and at some certain point you pass a tipping

325
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.940
point where something changes and the fundamental dynamics of that process change right.

326
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.270
So that's what we call an inflection point.

327
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.190
You can inflect down or inflect up.

328
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.810
So for instance manufacturing.

329
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:53.270
Right.

330
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.090
What's an inflection point manufacturing.

331
00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.600
Well there are inflection points all throughout the process if I make $10 right it might cost me $10

332
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.510
per dollar until I make a hundred.

333
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.210
At which point they're going to cost five.

334
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.820
When I make a thousand they're going to cost me $2.

335
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.690
And when I make a million they're going to cost me 40 cents.

336
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.930
Right so every time I pass that threshold I have an inflection point.

337
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:21.340
All of a sudden my expenses change but also user demand and user growth and also profit changes.

338
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:27.130
My question is do you ever see people do that where in their user growth they literally like Mark out

339
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:32.650
sections and say this is this you know our user growth is going to totally change here because something

340
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:37.020
changes or is that too much or is that something that we're on the flip side.

341
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.200
Is that something you generally expect people to put in because it's shows that they understand their

342
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.870
business.

343
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:48.970
That one is tough because they're kind of seen in both ways where some entrepreneurs you know you just

344
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:55.360
it's too hard to predict so then they kind of just Mahto out the grove to the best of their ability

345
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.750
where they don't pick out specific inflection points.

346
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:06.040
But you know I I haven't seen that many people actually try to pick out the timing of the inflection

347
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.650
points because it seems like that's that would be a pretty tough call to make.

348
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.670
Yeah I mean in the case study we did with my startup we had inflection points built into it but that

349
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:22.300
was because we are assuming we had this base promotion model where we would sign on big groups of people

350
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:28.660
who would then promote it so we'd see spikes and now we assumed like at first we'll be able to get one

351
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.250
of these every four months.

352
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:36.940
And then as we grow in general we get more sales people are more business development and so that could

353
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.120
shorten down to 2 and Jordan down one.

354
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:44.110
And that's why we saw this kind of like move Spike move Spike move Spike kind of thing.

355
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.560
So yeah I kind of agree with that like I've seen it go both ways.

356
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:54.870
If you do it and you do it wrong you kind of screw up the model in terms of your clarity of understanding.

357
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.930
Right so a lot of times you're doing a model so you can better understand it you can better communicate

358
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.930
how your business operates and the functional help of it to someone else.

359
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:08.440
So if you do too much of that and you're not 100 percent sure why you're doing it or you're not a hundred

360
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.940
percent confident it's true or accurate you're actually kind of doing yourself a disservice.

361
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:20.500
However I would be remiss if I was investing in a physical product business that did not understand

362
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:28.540
that there are very common thresholds at which your unit costs go down which means that you could potentially

363
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.420
lower your costs and then on the flip side.

364
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:38.530
Yeah there are always inflection points in advertising and growth I mean for instance let's say we use

365
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.300
Facebook ads.

366
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:39.670
Right.

367
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.150
Well we can figure out how much it costs for a Facebook ad and we can figure out how many customers

368
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:43.920
we can get from that.

369
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:49.330
But once you start spending ten thousand dollars a month then you can start using things like our brain

370
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:55.120
like our brain is this advertising network that shows those fake articles basically at the bottom of

371
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:55.690
articles.

372
00:24:55.690 --> 00:25:00.070
That's going to be a totally different market and you couldn't have gotten to that yet until you got

373
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.660
to a certain amount of users or a certain amount of money.

374
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:07.690
And there's a lot of advertising examples you could find where these networks are not going to be open

375
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:12.820
to you until you get to a certain size or growth at which point it will definitely change your trajectory.

376
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:19.520
So yeah I definitely probably say it's it's both like I would expect you to get the obvious ones.

377
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:24.210
And you know if you're in manufacturing and you don't know that your costs change they're not the problem.

378
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:29.120
But at the same time just don't go crazy with it I mean you could you could do this to death and you

379
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.900
just have the most confusing model ever made.

380
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.180
Yeah and I totally agree.

381
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:40.360
I think what I'm saying was you don't you don't manually put in these inflection points right as you

382
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.760
kind of model your business model.

383
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.200
You know if you have a point where you're saying we're going to be doing this up to this point and then

384
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.790
at this point we're going to be using the funding to do a totally different marketing push that's going

385
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.230
to do this.

386
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:58.850
The influx I'm going to come out from modeling those decisions make sense.

387
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:04.470
OK guys if you have questions like usual posted in the slack or the Q&amp;A you know let us know what you

388
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:05.150
thought.

389
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.580
Let us know if there's something you want to elaborate on or you is any questions we missed.

390
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.840
Otherwise we'll see in the next section.
