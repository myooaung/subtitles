00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,670
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,560
If I didn't know this by now you know that VCs care a lot about growth.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,130
So how do entrepreneurs and startups model growth in their financial models.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,060
Well there's an easy and lazy way and then there's a better way.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,040
Now the easy and lazy way is to just have growth rate as an assumption in the model like growing 5 percent

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,800
a week.

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:33,570
And this assumption can be made to change over time such as accelerating or slowing down or reversing

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,310
as the company gets up in size.

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,050
Let's look at some examples where we model monthly versus weekly growth rates.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,020
And then we'll look at the better way.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:51,920
All right let's look at a scenario where the person is using a monthly growth rate as an assumption

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,250
right.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,930
So this is an actual input into their model.

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:04,470
And let's say they're starting with a user base of five thousand users and in a 24 month period they

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,330
want to reach some sort of a target.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:06,920
OK.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,080
So right here they want to target $5 million let's say users then they would need to get to about 35

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,300
percent monthly growth rate.

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,560
So this kind of modeling is very common.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,820
When you look at the user growth rates and you chart it out you see something like this.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,830
The infamous hockey stick that every VC has been barfing over for however long.

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,890
That's because the growth rate that is used is put in.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,300
You'll see that you know depending on what that growth rate is the result at the end of just even a

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,910
24 month period can be pretty drastic.

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,300
Right.

26
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:56,970
And if we go to a weekly grow for example the difference is even worse here.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,320
We're only doing 1 percent differences right here on the 10 percent range and the difference here is

28
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:09,680
between under a million users and 9 billion users with a 10 percent range.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:09,860
Right.

30
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:17,880
So this growth rate here is I guess it's pulling out of thin air or pulling it somewhere where it's

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,060
not very savory but it doesn't really work this way.

32
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,840
You don't just say I want to have this growth rate for my startup.

33
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,810
As you can see besides the fact that the numbers that you use will vary widely and can change the growth

34
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,820
rates like crazy.

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,630
Where are you ultimately pulling these growth rates from out of thin air or somewhere less savory that

36
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm not going to mention.

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,350
See the problem with that approach is that in real life you don't get to just name the growth rate you

38
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,540
want to have growth rate is the outcome.

39
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,760
It's a result.

40
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,870
So what's a better approach better approach is to make growth rate a result rather than input as an

41
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,770
assumption.

42
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,220
So first you decide what is your metric.

43
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,640
The one thing that measure success or failure for your startup.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:17,220
And then think about what would it take for you to achieve that milestone and win then work backwards

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,530
to derive the growth rate that you need in order to achieve those targets.

46
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,960
So let's see how that plays out and the model better way maybe to do something like this.

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:35,480
So in this example we say maybe you find out what your target is it can be a target revenue right.

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,160
Or to be target number of users whatever that may be.

49
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,210
Let's use this as an example right now.

50
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:48,590
Let's say the start of wants to get to a million dollars a month revenue and it will be charging what

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,900
it were some average revenue per customer per month.

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:00,120
So in order to reach this amount they're going to need a little over 100000 users are active paying

53
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,030
customers.

54
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:09,360
OK so if we're still looking at the 24 month period then the growth rate needed in order to achieve

55
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,100
this value say you're starting at with zero users is going to be going from zero to this value and then

56
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,620
taking 24 months to get there.

57
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,480
Okay.

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,970
For example if your goal is to have 10000 paying customers in 12 months you can work backwards through

59
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,700
your funnel to see how many leads you need to generate what conversion rates you need to have that you

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,280
need to achieve what kind of traffic you need and how much ad spend that you only see once you have

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,800
all that figured out.

62
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:46,140
So you've got to remember that just because someone becomes a customer doesn't mean that they'll stay

63
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,250
that way.

64
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,180
Businesses will lose customers and your business will too.

65
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,650
So in our next lecture we're going to look at how to factor in attrition or turn into our modeling.
