00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.910
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.680
All right on to business model number three.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.090
So so far what have we covered.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.750
You've covered free but with ad based revenue like say you know your online newspaper or blog and read

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.320
Harvard affiliate models which is basically when one person sells something that they don't own or produce

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.730
and then they get a commission off of the sale they create it in this lecture.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.710
We're going to talk about the model of freemium which is a portmanteaux.

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.960
Yes and is said portmanteaux of the forward free and premium.

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.570
Chances are if you've ever downloaded a mobile app in the last decade yes decade because iPhone came

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.290
out in 2006 it is crazy to think about.

11
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.810
Depressing too.

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.290
You've run into one of these business models before the way a freemium business model works is if you

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.890
offer your main product for free but then you offer access to premium or extra features the user than

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.180
has to pay.

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.910
There are millions of examples of this just from like looking at my phone.

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.840
I found Evernote right.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.420
The app you can take notes in that Spotify it's a music streaming service and YouTube you know YouTube

18
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.520
actually technically counts as freemium now.

19
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.880
No lets you store unlimited notes but then charges you if you want to add team features or if you want

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.700
to have a certain level of storage.

21
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.120
Spotify is free but if you want to get rid of those really annoying ads that always interrupt your song

22
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.850
right at the perfect moment in the song you have to pay.

23
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
And then YouTube now has YouTube Red which is a service you can pay $10 a month.

24
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.490
I think so.

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.110
So that you can exit out of YouTube videos and then have them continue playing in the background.

26
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.850
Yet.

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.880
$10 to have to let a video play in the background which everybody else lets you do for free anyway.

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.480
Now the basic idea behind this is that free products are the easiest to get users for.

29
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.940
That part is kind of obvious.

30
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.790
And naturally when you have a pool of free product users so I'm going to use it a lot and some are going

31
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.010
to use it a little.

32
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.830
Some might use the entire feature set in the product and others might not need it really at all.

33
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.890
This happens naturally in any user group but by adding premium features you can cater to power users

34
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.580
or users have a specific unmet need already within the free product and you can significantly lower

35
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.460
the barrier to getting them to purchase from you.

36
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.230
So at the end of the day you'll have a group of free users and a group of paid users.

37
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.920
Hopefully the number of paid users is enough to keep the lights on in your modern San Francisco loft

38
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.210
that you pay six thousand dollars a month for.

39
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.920
Keep in mind this is inherently different than offering a fully paid tool and then just giving them

40
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.380
a free trial.

41
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.290
Although those two models are successful often for the same reasons.

42
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.640
Typically the most successful products using either of these models are the ones that either become

43
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.120
ingrained in your life quickly or after repeated use become more and more of a hassle to switch away

44
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.640
from.

45
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.710
So in the former there's a company called zippier which is a good example.

46
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.770
Maybe zap here.

47
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.630
I don't know it's spelled like zippier rapier but whatever.

48
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.160
There are a productivity app that lets you take all of your favorite softwares and then allows them

49
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.630
to communicate with each other and send commands.

50
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.420
I can tweet something and then have Zappy your tell Twitter to send that tweet to my slack without me

51
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.380
having to do anything.

52
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.770
So the more you use the system the Morial start to rely on it it's actually really convenient automation.

53
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.870
Now the other camp we have apps like let's say one password or really any photo storage app you've ever

54
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.730
used.

55
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.080
The more you store with them the harder it is to leave and lose all of that data.

56
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.420
Switching to another one.

57
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.320
You can put a lot of work into it.

58
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.970
OK so that pretty much covers that we're going to take a look at how this plays out in a model.

59
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.740
We're going to do similar to what we did before and assume a revenue target per month and then work

60
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.150
backwards with downloads slash free user registrations.

61
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.360
Simon take it away.

62
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.420
All right let's again start with a sanity check.

63
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.450
Right so a freemium model.

64
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:12.370
Think about maybe an app that has downloads and of the people that it you may only have a certain percentage

65
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.690
actually activated that register or start using it.

66
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.730
Some of the downloads are dead never be downloaded.

67
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.130
Forget about it and it never happens right.

68
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.650
So then you have a certain amount that's activated and then maybe some of those that are activated that

69
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.320
are using it gets converted into some premium users.

70
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.540
Right.

71
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.950
So if we have say a million downloads.

72
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:43.080
Eighty five percent activated right a hundred fifty thousand is activated and a premium conversion rate

73
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.250
of 2 percent.

74
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.570
Then we have this breakdown between the users who activated that are going to be free versus premium

75
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.720
users right.

76
00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:02.930
And so if you have a premium fee of say $19 then you can expect to make that out in terms of the total

77
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.310
number total revenue from premiums.

78
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.920
Another big question though is you know or is this lifetime downloads or is it a weekly or monthly.

79
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.380
Right what time range you're looking at and what kind of fee is it.

80
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.630
Right.

81
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.680
So we're going to look at three different examples here where what if the fee was a lifetime fee just

82
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.120
the pay once and then they get to use it forever.

83
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.450
What if it's an annual fee and it would have its monthly subscription.

84
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.970
OK.

85
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.290
So let's start with the lifetime premium model for us.

86
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.420
Now assume that were given monthly downloads for the first 24 months.

87
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.770
Okay.

88
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.780
Maybe it starts off at 100000 and it's growing at some steady click until the end of the 24 months where

89
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.240
it expects to get about 900000 downloads.

90
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.820
All right.

91
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.960
And then we're assuming the same activation rate from the front.

92
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:07.600
So then our monthly activation numbers is just going to be the monthly downloads times the activation.

93
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.900
Right.

94
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.320
Right.

95
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.730
Copy and paste that there.

96
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.670
And then the premium conversion we're pulling from the front then we'll be 2 percent.

97
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.700
And then we can calculate the number of free users and premium users in any given month.

98
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.390
Okay.

99
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:32.840
So the free users are going to equal to that total monthly that it's activated times 1 minus the premium

100
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.940
percentage.

101
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.990
And so we can copy and paste that for the rest of them for the premium users then then it's going to

102
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.540
just be equal to total monthly activated Minus the number of free users.

103
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.210
So that will be the number of premium users.

104
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.570
Now if this is a lifetime fee of $9000 then its pretty easy to calculate the total premium revenue right.

105
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:08.900
Is just going to be the monthly premium users times that once in a life time the one time lifetime fee

106
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:18.710
of $19 and then if we copy and paste the rest of that we see the expected revenue or the premiums from

107
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.150
the premium users per month.

108
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.570
Now this is only coming from the users each month.

109
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.470
So that one is pretty straightforward.

110
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.110
Lets see what the annual one looks like.

111
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.040
Now we have the annual one now assuming all this up here is the same.

112
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.990
Right.

113
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:43.610
And then these are still the same but now we're looking at you know the new monthly for users right.

114
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:52.690
And in talking about these users as monthly users so we're going to be looking at it a little bit differently.

115
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.450
Okay.

116
00:07:53.660 --> 00:08:00.020
Because we need to kind of track how the members are which members are going to be paying and they're

117
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.630
going to be paying a year from now.

118
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.240
Right.

119
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:09.050
So the total number of numbers paying in the first year that's paid annual membership is just going

120
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.710
to be whoever's being added that month because they're only paying once a year.

121
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.550
Right.

122
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.510
The tricky part or the part that's different is when we get to after a year.

123
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.840
OK so when we get to month 13.

124
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.650
So the first part is going to be easy right.

125
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.560
We just have because that many years come that month they're paying the annual premium.

126
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:38.510
Now it's in the second year we're going to have the users that's coming from the 13th month paying the

127
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.390
premium but we're also going to have users from the first month paying the premium right.

128
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.940
So here this is where it looks a little bit different.

129
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.130
And we may want to highlight that with just a different color.

130
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:58.330
So if we're ever looking back at that we can see that this is a different formula.

131
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:05.210
So here then the members that are paying a premium will be those new members from that month plus the

132
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.850
members from a year ago.

133
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:12.850
And we do that for the rest of the 24 months then we have these new members that are paid.

134
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.380
So these are annual numbers.

135
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.630
Now we can calculate the new premium revenue which is going to be equal to the members who are paying

136
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:31.870
premium and in any given month times now the annual premium so in this case the first few months is

137
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.540
going to be exactly the same as the the lifetime fee right.

138
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:44.500
But what's going to be different is in months 13 you see here for the lifetime is 100 and 1000 in the

139
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.480
annual one month 13.

140
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.060
We're going to see a bump now.

141
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.350
Right.

142
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.080
We're going to see a little bit more here.

143
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.480
And we going to see more of a bump for ever after that.

144
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.860
So it's a slight change.

145
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.540
Not that difficult when you're thinking about it now.

146
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.000
Let's do the monthly one.

147
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.470
This one's a little bit different now.

148
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.740
So again same given information right.

149
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:15.310
Same monthly downloads same activations same premium conversion so we have the same free users and premium.

150
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:20.650
But the difference here now is we're going to have to keep track of the cumulative membership.

151
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.390
Right because every member is going to be paying every month.

152
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.940
So we're going to have to add them up over time.

153
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:32.530
So in the first month is quite easy is just however many premium members were at it then in the second

154
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:37.930
month it's going to be the members that are added but Plus our previous total.

155
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.380
So this is a way for you to do a cumulative running calculation.

156
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:51.100
Right we add the previous total to the new addition and if we take this formula and we take it to 24

157
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.090
months we see that it keeps adding the membership grows much quicker.

158
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.210
Now these are the paying members now.

159
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.090
Okay.

160
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.660
So then the total premiums.

161
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:08.350
The calculation is done in the same way but now it's the cumulative members paying the premium times

162
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.030
the monthly premium rate.

163
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:21.160
Okay so if we have that and we have this so now we can see the difference is quite a bit right and going

164
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.200
from lifetime to annual to monthly in the Monthly and the third month we break a hundred thousand.

165
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:31.010
But in the lifetime of an annual Optix closer a year.

166
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:38.470
So there you have it three different ways to model out simple revenue model for a freemium model.

167
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:45.280
But it really depends on how you're charging right whether you're charging a lifetime or monthly or

168
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.530
annual.

169
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.200
You know it can determine the revenue model differently.

170
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:56.380
Now there's something here that we didn't put in any of these revenue models because we touched on that

171
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:03.010
before but we're going to introduce it later in the case studies is obviously all of these here assume

172
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:09.460
zero attrition that you're keeping all your premium users right now for those of you who want to take

173
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.620
on the challenge.

174
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:17.830
I encourage you to layer on attrition into these models so that you have these new additions but then

175
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.720
you have attrition of the users.

176
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.980
So then you're calculating the correct premiums.

177
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.720
With that factored in.
