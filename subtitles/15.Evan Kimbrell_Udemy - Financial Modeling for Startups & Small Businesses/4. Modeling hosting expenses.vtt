00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.540
Hey guys will come back to this course and this lecture I'm going to demonstrate a few ways you can

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.710
model out expenses that grow with the number of users or customers that you have.

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.310
Maybe it's hosting related costs or the amount of stores that they use.

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.080
We'll be looking at three ways you can do this now.

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.310
The first one is going to be a simple and easy way it is.

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.560
Again it's always OK to start with the easy one first just to get a feel for what the numbers might

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.660
look like.

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.970
And as you continue to understand your situation as you know more about it you can always find ways

9
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.400
to adjust your model to more accurately reflect what's actually happening.

10
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.290
So let's start with the easy one right now.

11
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:54.340
Okay let's start with the simple case first let's assume that we have this kind of use your projection

12
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.730
and then the active users in any given month is given on line 11 row 11 here.

13
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.670
So by the time we get to the end of the four years we're at over five million active users but we're

14
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.000
starting off at under a thousand.

15
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.740
Okay.

16
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.850
So we have this active users then a really easy way to calculate your hosting needs is if you have a

17
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.400
hosting cost per user per month.

18
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.470
Okay.

19
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.070
Now that we have this we can make an assumption and then then the cost per month is just going to be

20
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.980
the number of users at that time times the cost per user per month.

21
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.620
And then we can calculate that when we copy and paste it across we can calculate that per month.

22
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.780
So then we start off at 20 you know $240 and then by the time we're at 5.4 million users.

23
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.750
It's getting a lot more expensive.

24
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.420
Now this is a really easy way to do this.

25
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.320
And if you don't have any word as a starting point you can start here to kind of just factor that in.

26
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.110
But we're going to do something better.

27
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.730
You know that these kinds of expenses are never just plain flat rate like that.

28
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.370
They're usually something that is tier pricing especially when it comes to hosting.

29
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.170
So we're going to look at two different ways to model tier pricing in terms of modeling your hosting

30
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.350
costs.

31
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.310
Okay.

32
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.640
So a better way to do it is because you know these kinds of costs tend to follow tears.

33
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.200
They're just not going to be one flat rate.

34
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.910
They depend on the number of users and you may increasingly get to higher tears as you have more users

35
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.690
where it may look something like this we're going to look at two examples.

36
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.870
First example is we have these pricing tiers here.

37
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.090
Once you reach a certain number of users then you go into the next pricing tier and then once you reach

38
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.080
an X users you reached the next pricing tier here.

39
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.110
So the pricing tiers are charged in such a way where there's a flat rate and then there's a there is

40
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.210
a per cost per user rate now fly rate gets higher and higher but then the per user rate gets lower and

41
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.770
lower.

42
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.580
So with the same active user projections Let's see how that would look.

43
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.650
So in this one we want to make sure we calculate the correct costs for each.

44
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.580
Tears will recur calculate the costs in the correct year depending on the number of users.

45
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.520
If you have fewer than 50000 users then we want to make sure we calculate in this first year.

46
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.060
Right.

47
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.010
So the way we do that is we first have to check to make sure that we're in the correct year and if we

48
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.530
are then calculate the cost there.

49
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.420
If not then show nothing which has put two quotes here and it will show an empty set.

50
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.440
So what's the check.

51
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.290
For the first one it's pretty straightforward.

52
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.670
Our check is here is the number of active users less than this count here.

53
00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.220
If it is then then the price is going to be the flat rate times the number of users times the cost per

54
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.930
users.

55
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.160
Now we copy this all the way across then we're going to get this calculation for all the months where

56
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.450
the number of users is fewer than 50000.

57
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.810
Right.

58
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.240
So once we get past 50000 we see that then it's going to have nothing after that.

59
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.160
So how does the formula work for the other tiers.

60
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.320
Well let's take a look at this one we just got to do the same thing except er check is different.

61
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.300
Or check is has to make sure that it's in this range now.

62
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.150
So how do we check.

63
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.520
Well we've got to use this number and this number to check.

64
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.970
Basically we would use this tears calculation if the number of users is greater than this in less than

65
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.990
this number.

66
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.760
So has to be greater than 50000 and less than 250000 in the archives.

67
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.320
So that's what we're checking we're seeing if an the and is shaking to conditions to make sure they're

68
00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:00.170
both true and the condition is hate the number of users is less than 250000 and the number of users

69
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:08.290
is greater than 50000 if both are true then calculate the costs based on this tier if not show zeros.

70
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.300
So we have that and we see the same thing.

71
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.850
It's going to keep doing that until we reach 250000 and make the jump right to 250000 the users now

72
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.180
over 250000 now we get to the next year.

73
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.780
So that's what we did for all of the comps here.

74
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.180
Each time we're checking in the correct conditions there right.

75
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.350
So we moved down we're checking these two and we moved down.

76
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.230
We're checking these two.

77
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.660
Now the only difference is we get the last tier We don't need to check this number because there's no

78
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.280
upper limit.

79
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.970
So the only condition is if we're greater than the amount of users then use this rate.

80
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.180
Okay so what we did is then when we have this we copy and paste all of the formulas across.

81
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.530
And what we end up having is it calculates the crack hosting costs in the right here and it kind of

82
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.070
staggers naturally.

83
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.580
And so then our total costs in any given month we just take the sum of all these because we know we're

84
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.730
only going to be adding the correct when all the other ones that aren't supposed to be there are just

85
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.120
going to be blanks.

86
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.840
So then we would pull the correct one and then that roll right there is our housing costs right.

87
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.190
So we see that now.

88
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:20.630
The other scenario is when we have a tear where it's not a straight Hey once you get past the certain

89
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.380
number of users then you're in the next tier completely.

90
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.920
It's where hey your first 50000 users is going to cost you this much.

91
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.340
Then your next 200000 users is going to cost you this much.

92
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.640
Then the next 750000 users are going to cost you this much.

93
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:42.320
So regardless you're always going to be paying these lower tears and then you just as you add more users

94
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.200
you reach a higher and higher tier.

95
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.790
OK.

96
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.950
In terms of the cost.

97
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:55.630
So you know maybe we'll adjust that to make it fit the same ones we were doing just to be a consistent

98
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.360
point of 5 and then we'll do 0.02.

99
00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.990
Okay.

100
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.950
So now we have the same costs but it's going to work a little bit differently now.

101
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.450
Right.

102
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.130
So instead of calculating costs here what we're going to do is we're going to try to calculate the number

103
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.840
of users that should fall into each tier.

104
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:19.790
So what we have here is this top row if there's fewer than 50000 users then all the users are going

105
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.200
to fall into this category.

106
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:27.710
But once we have more than 50000 users this should top out or maxed out at 50000 and then spill over

107
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.250
into the next year.

108
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.020
So let's take a look at everything below 50000 is going to go there.

109
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:39.700
But once we have more than 50000 DC that we have it starts to max out at that number.

110
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.840
So we try to do that for all of the correct tears.

111
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.310
Now how do we calculate that right.

112
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:52.460
So in this one let's take a look at this this one we're taking the minimum member when we want to max

113
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.040
out something we use the mean function.

114
00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:02.360
So what is the maximum value here the maximum value is going to be this range that's given right that

115
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.540
top minus the bottom range.

116
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.330
So the max is going to be in this one.

117
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.590
Two hundred thousand.

118
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.740
But if there's a spill over that's less than that then the way we calculate the spillover is the number

119
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.190
of users minus how many that's been used in the previous year.

120
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.060
In this case it's 50 pounds.

121
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.790
So then whatever's left over will fall into this category.

122
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.130
So we have the 7000 something now.

123
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.460
The other tiers is going to be the same the only difference is we're going to have to take the some

124
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.500
of what's already been used.

125
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:39.430
So let's take a look at a tier The lower in the selection here.

126
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.950
So here the max range is going to be from this minus that.

127
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.310
Right because everything's already captured in the previous years.

128
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.560
So the max range is 5 million minus 2.5 million.

129
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.910
In this case because that's what we use but it's less than that than the spill over spillage is the

130
00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:02.500
number of active users minus all the users that's already falling into the other tears.

131
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.290
Okay.

132
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.860
So then whatever's left over then spills over here then once you get past 5 million tops out as well

133
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.610
and then we have this extra spillage that goes into the final tier.

134
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.140
So then how do we calculate the hosting costs in this way then what the hosting costs is going to just

135
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:28.010
equal to the number of users in each tier times the corresponding price in which case we're going to

136
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.370
use some product.

137
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:35.060
We're going to take the product basically the number of users times the cost per user for each tier

138
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.730
and then we're going to sum up all the products.

139
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.390
So that's exactly what we're doing here.

140
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.150
Okay.

141
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:46.730
We're going to do that for each month and then we have these calculations the hosting costs for each

142
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.810
month here.

143
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.250
The last thing we're going to look at is the another example.

144
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.830
Maybe you want to calculate the cost of something based on usage.

145
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:02.260
Now remember we did the segmentation based on usage we can do the same thing.

146
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.430
We can categorize our users based on some usage right.

147
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:12.860
So let's say we for example have again the same sort of user projection but now what we have is this

148
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.160
kind of usage distribution.

149
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.420
Maybe it's how much storage they use.

150
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.920
Right.

151
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:24.830
So if it's how much storage they use then we can then take that number of users we can use this distribution

152
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:32.450
that we have and then calculate the usage by each group and then once we have that number of users that

153
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.010
fall into each group then we can look at the costs right.

154
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.650
So maybe that here is the cost per gig and then that's their average usage by that group.

155
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:42.250
Okay.

156
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:49.780
So then when we have that then what we can do is we have then the number of users right times their

157
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:56.390
average use times the average costs for the use right per gig and then we can do that calculation.

158
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:06.980
And then what we have then is we have the usage the cost of say the gigs that's used by each crew for

159
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.660
each of the months and then when we sum it all up then we have the total cost.

160
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.860
So there are several ways to do this.

161
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:20.450
And we get the Easyway that's kind of flat and easy it's easy but a lazy way to do it.

162
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:26.090
You may want to look at doing it by tiers and here are two different ways that models two different

163
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:32.570
kinds of tier one that is once you pass a certain number of users then your entire cost follows in that

164
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:37.920
tier versus the other one where it's a spillage you know the first X users is like this.

165
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.250
And the next group of users that then the next group like that.

166
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:49.870
And our last example we like that by usage so you can see you can adjust your model to fit whatever

167
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:55.470
pricing structure that you expect to see for the cost that you're going to be incurring.

168
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:02.110
So it's really really important to know exactly how the pricing model works for the services that you're

169
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.150
going to be paying for because how you actually execute them in terms of your modeling might look very

170
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.000
different.

171
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.770
All right.

172
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.520
One last way that we can model this is to look at usage.

173
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:21.210
Remember how we segmented users by usage while we can use this same structure to model up the cost.

174
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:27.820
If you want to base some cost based on your users usage say you need to track how many gigs of bandwidth

175
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.980
they use in any given month we might be able to model something like this.
