00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.620
He will come back in this lecture we're going to do the expense modeling overview for the smoke Chile

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.230
case study.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.630
So here's the expenses worksheet now for this case study here.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.020
Think about a restaurant right.

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.320
Just think of all the things that you're going to have to spend money on.

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.050
So the biggest items list go over those first biggest items is going to be Coggs right your cost of

7
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.020
goods sold as most of your food costs and paper products.

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.640
You know things associated with selling your item.

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.630
Now the reason I did it this way where we had a starting point and then a stabilized rate stabilized

10
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.110
rate should be something that you do research on in your industry that you target towards.

11
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.700
OK.

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:55.300
For a fast casual Mexican restaurant that's similar to like a portly food costs are going to be kind

13
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.760
of around this range.

14
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.680
OK.

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:08.490
But as a new restaurant what ends up happening is you sometimes tend to order more than you need.

16
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.160
You still are trying to figure out where to get it from.

17
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.820
How much you need in stock how to prep it so that you minimize waste.

18
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.260
So initially you're going to be a lot less efficient.

19
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.390
So initially it's going to take you more food items to get through in order to make the same amount

20
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.170
of sales.

21
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.110
So early on you're going to be less efficient.

22
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.580
That's something that we've seen with different restaurant concepts as you know.

23
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.170
It can be 20 to 30 percent less efficient in the beginning and it and can take a while to really become

24
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.450
more efficient usually at least nine months to a year.

25
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.240
Okay maybe sometimes longer but we'll see it a year and then the other big item is going to be the salary.

26
00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.530
The end for salary to look at this two ways we're going to have a manager that has a base salary and

27
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.520
they're going to get a once a year bonus.

28
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.410
Okay.

29
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.150
And then we're going to have to maybe two assistant manager who we can change the headcount but you

30
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.580
probably don't need more than two assistant managers that are going to get paid at a higher hourly wage

31
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.170
than everyone else you know in the other hourly

32
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:30.650
who are going to get maybe 11 50 an hour ok for the other hour leaves and then these assistant managers

33
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.560
are going to get 16 50 an hour.

34
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.490
OK let's say the assistant managers are going to be full time.

35
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.610
They're going to be part time say 30 25 30 hours a week which is put 30 right now and you could think

36
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:52.370
of it this way a full time manager can be there for the hour of prep all the way to the 12 hours of

37
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.570
operations all the way through the end of you know to closing and shutting down the store.

38
00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.700
Right.

39
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.710
They can come in at different points.

40
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.330
But if you have to assist the managers the assistant managers generally can open close the stores or

41
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.100
can alternate with the main manager.

42
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.340
Right.

43
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.510
And that gives the manager a little bit more leeway and they can come in during the most peak times

44
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.250
and then be gone during the slower times were a system manager can handle that.

45
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:29.390
Now the other Aurelia's you know we can have will take about three parts of the day if there's 12 hours

46
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.820
operation maybe we have three peak lunch hour and then we have three peak dinner hours.

47
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.700
Then the other six hours are just we'll just call them the other hours off peak hours and maybe maybe

48
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.760
during the off peak hours we don't need that many people we only need two people in the back and you

49
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.840
know two in the front but during the peak lunch and dinner hours many more maybe seven or even double

50
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.110
let's say eight people during those times so you have to do your scheduling accordingly.

51
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.470
OK and then now we're going to assume that better events takes five percent of is five percent of sales.

52
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.280
OK so that's two of the biggest cost items with that makes up the assumptions for the prime cost array

53
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.460
and here the other stuff well you know we've got rent and we have some of these other spends right that

54
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.720
we're just going to assume some sort of monthly rate for the space.

55
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.340
You know utilities might be higher repair maintenance might be lower but then these are going to grow

56
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.920
at some rate over time.

57
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.150
Okay.

58
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.950
Now another thing that we got to factor in is the transaction fees right.

59
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.270
Some people are going to pay with credit card and have to pay or 3 percent transaction fee to the credit

60
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.190
card company but not everyone's paying credit card.

61
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.230
So you make some assumption about how you know what percentage of transactions are credit card base

62
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.420
and which ones are not.

63
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.370
Then we can make some assumption around that.

64
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:06.180
And then the final assumptions here is here is the assumption for the growth rate of the wages.

65
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.700
If you move it to the other side I actually count them together.

66
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.300
OK.

67
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.030
Graaff wait for the wages and then here is a growth rate for the other expenses.

68
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:28.750
You know let me just reorganize this just to group them in a way that is more logical.

69
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.260
So we have these expenses in this way.

70
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.320
Now the average days open per day per month.

71
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.210
This is something that we need to calculate the actual labor costs for the Arlene's because we're looking

72
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.520
at hours in a day.

73
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.510
So we need to calculate how many hours in a month.

74
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.280
Right.

75
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.660
That's where it's coming in.

76
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:59.640
So once we have those assumptions and started looking at the actual expenses Well the first thing we

77
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.630
do is not really the expenses but the startup costs.

78
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.180
So we have the startup period we have the costs and which ones corresponding to the different parts

79
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.900
of the startup period.

80
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.270
And then that together gives us the total start up costs right.

81
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.920
All the start of expenses.

82
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.260
And after we officially open but some of it's going on in the grand opening period.

83
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.820
Okay.

84
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:32.710
And then we usually want to put the growth rate related stuff near the top as well.

85
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.920
So some of the information are based as a percentage of sales so we want to push the sales line from

86
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:49.640
the revenue part into here and then we can start calculating things so payment ones is you know 55 percent

87
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.120
of the sales is credit card base and then we're charging 3 percent of that.

88
00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:04.610
So basically the net sales times the 55 percent times the 3 percent we get the transaction fee and then

89
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.090
that gets calculated and the food costs because it has a moving percentage we got to first calculate

90
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.380
the percentage rate.

91
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.290
So we get to say hey it starts out on Grand Opening starts at this high rate cogs rate and then over

92
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:24.450
time it becomes more efficient until you kind of average this food cost rate.

93
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.170
So then we have that schedule.

94
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:32.610
Then we multiply that percentage times sales to get big cogs for that month.

95
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.870
Now for the other big items the salary stuff what we're going to treat them separately right.

96
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.190
We have the manager part where we have the salary and then we have the bonus.

97
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.410
So the salary.

98
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.110
It's a recurring thing we're paying them.

99
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.510
You know as soon as they're joining.

100
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.810
Right.

101
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.970
So for this one we're hiring them while training because you got to train them you need them to help

102
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.840
you train the associates so you're paying them that month.

103
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.820
And then they're getting paid.

104
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.320
You know then starting from the training through the grand opening and then through the opening but

105
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.090
then we'll do the annual bonuses starting from the grand opening.

106
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:14.070
So so every every 12 months after that they get that little bonus here.

107
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:14.700
OK.

108
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:23.230
And then for the assistant managers can be calculated similarly as the Israelis were looking at the

109
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.120
head count.

110
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.580
You know this is hours per week.

111
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.830
So we're just going to multiply that by four to get a month.

112
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.110
Right.

113
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.600
And then multiply it by the hourly rate so we get the assistant manager rates here.

114
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.540
And again we're going to hire them during training for the enrollees.

115
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.360
You know we should probably hire the Arab League during training too.

116
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:50.010
Right now I have them only coming in during the grand opening.

117
00:08:50.010 --> 00:09:03.330
So what we'll do is to either a grand opening and it's included in the active or during training

118
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.110
because it's kind of either or I can just add them together and it will take one of the other ones so

119
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:19.280
case I'm going to copy these two cells here and then I want to piece it over and then right now it starts

120
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:26.140
with the training but you know for training we really don't need that much right.

121
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.470
And kind of maybe just need a little bit.

122
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:35.900
So what I might do is make it so that I go if

123
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:51.340
if the training is equal to one then it's whatever the value is but we're just going to use We're just

124
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.770
going to multiply it by maybe a quarter let's say we're only going to need a week's worth of pay for

125
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.400
the training.

126
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.800
OK.

127
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.860
They don't need to be operating every day all day.

128
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.590
Right.

129
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.090
Otherwise it's the whole thing.

130
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.920
OK.

131
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:12.210
So so we do that I can make it so that during training it's only a quarter you know wherever the training

132
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:12.560
is.

133
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:21.560
Now the reason it's in the formula and not just you know here the cell times 25 is because well what

134
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.390
if training you know what if this moves around if we change our assumptions.

135
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:31.980
Now this part right here for what I put in for training is going to move if the timing of the training

136
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.440
moves.

137
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.010
OK.

138
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.900
So that looks more reasonable.

139
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:42.160
We're not going to have for you know all these rallies on during the training month.

140
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.520
OK.

141
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.560
So then that gives us total wages when we sum those up and then we can calculate the benefits they take

142
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.790
taken just this percentage of the sales.

143
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:58.480
And then when we add benefits in total wages we have the total labor right here.

144
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.120
And these are the other overhead.

145
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.490
So like you know utilities repairmen and supplies a lot of those things we're not going to be doing

146
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.860
that while we're building out.

147
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.920
But you know during the bill that you're still going to be paying rent.

148
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:12.730
So.

149
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.870
So how to pay rent.

150
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.280
Right.

151
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.860
While you're setting up you're still paying rent.

152
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.360
So that's where that's coming in.

153
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.610
It's only some.

154
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.800
All of these up here all of these elements are going to have the actual cash flow on a monthly basis

155
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.660
for all of these periods and again down here.

156
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:35.420
We can then sum all of these together tally them together for the the year to see what it looks like

157
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.990
for a full year.

158
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.620
Now the next lecture we're going to look at the revenue and expenses together and then see how much

159
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.960
capital we actually need for starting this restaurant.
