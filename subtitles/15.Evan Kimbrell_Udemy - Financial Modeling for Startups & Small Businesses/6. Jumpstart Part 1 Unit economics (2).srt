1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,940
And we are back.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,270
All right.

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,300
Let's wrap up the unit economics analysis of our warm up business and get you onto the more complicated

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,230
stuff recap so far we're making a lemonade stand.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,130
We took the time to sit down and think through the ingredients and the product.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,640
The auxiliary items needed to service the product and then we dwelled on the fixed costs associated

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,840
with setting up the stand and getting a sign that silently screams at the passer bys.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,180
Last year we focused on unit economics i.e. here is some lemonade.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,300
How much did that just cost me to give you.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,430
Why do we need to know that.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,060
Well because it's a metric you constantly need to monitor in any business.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,370
Most businesses will strive to have their unit costs under control and are generally going to shoot

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,870
at a minimum for having their unit cost lower than the average sales price.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,420
Of course as we'll get into this later this varies heavily by industry.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,730
So we only use this metric in the broader context of our business.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,790
Food and beverage businesses generally have to rely on high unit margins just to make the whole thing

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,410
balance out because they have really high overheads and fixed costs.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,930
Anyway we're looking at this lovely excel sheet over here and we can see that we've just calculated

19
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,760
with a little research the per ounce cost of each ingredient and then the per cup cost of each ingredient.

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,190
And then finally the total cost to make some lemonade.

21
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,710
Now a lot of people might be tempted to just flip the table and call it quits right here.

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,490
After all we know what bar we have to jump over.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,340
But if anyone Oh I don't know someone that smoke cigars and wears a pinstripe suit looks at this they'll

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,380
think you're not serious.

25
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,130
Right.

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,850
Well why is that.

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,680
Because we're not accounting for two very common things.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,010
Number one is waste.

29
00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:00,300
Number two is contingency waste means any of the product that you lose without recouping any payment

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,200
for it.

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,380
If you hadn't thought about that well welcome to food and beverage land.

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,310
You can't exactly restock that cup eliminated for a month that the lemon slice can all like Squishy.

33
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:18,410
So we need to accommodate that and we need to in general add in some element of cushion or contingency.

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,550
There's a broader lesson that needs to be learned here that we will explore more in depth in the course

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,310
when you're making a model.

36
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:31,220
It's virtually impossible to predict every single thing that's going to happen to your business.

37
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,680
The wind could blow away some of your cups.

38
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,260
CBS could go on sale in a desperate bid to lower its stock of sugar.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,630
Your younger brother could accidentally run his bike into your stand because well that's exactly what

40
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,080
he would do because it's in his little brother DNA.

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,240
The point with modeling is that you are trying your best to predict what's going to happen but you're

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,210
aware of the fact that it's just not entirely possible.

43
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,620
People will judge your models based on how realistic they are and how they demonstrate the level to

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,710
which you understand your industry.

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,240
Being realistic includes understanding you can't know everything.

46
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,710
Don't worry we'll get more into this later.

47
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,380
Now back to lemonade.

48
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,030
In this case since we're already acknowledging waste we can actually just roll that up into contingency

49
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,020
and let's say we're pretty aggressive with this and we assume that waste and our o fund is going to

50
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,350
represent 10 percent of the total cost of eliminate.

51
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,410
And I mean aggressive as in you really think you're going to run on a tight ship.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
You're not giving yourself a whole lot of room to screw up.

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,950
So after all that's said and done we're going to add another eight cents to our total cost to make a

54
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,570
cup of lemonade bringing us up to 89 cents.

55
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,290
So still barely anything in the grand scheme of things.

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,480
Now how exactly does this knowledge that it's 89 cents per cop inform us going forward.

57
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,730
Well now that we know what it costs to sell one cup we know what the bare minimum we need to charge

58
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,190
for one cup is.

59
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,960
That's assuming obviously that we want to maintain profitability from the get go which we do in this

60
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,620
case.

61
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,130
OK great.

62
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,290
So that's it.

63
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,690
Right.

64
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,650
We just charge anything over 89 cents and we'll be loads of money in no time.

65
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,160
Right.

66
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,320
Well no.

67
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,490
In order to further refine our model and get even closer to a truer estimate of the cost of a couple

68
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,230
eliminate.

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,240
We have to take a page out of the playbook of the oh so many failed on demand startups and not to forget

70
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Labor prepping eliminate takes time and selling it takes time.

71
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,930
It's not reasonable to assume that you and only yourself will forever man the booth and squeeze the

72
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,350
lemons.

73
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,190
I know that sounds weird as a pure zero dollar an hour volunteer.

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,440
You have effectively in this scenario made yourself a terrible job.

75
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,310
And on that disheartening note I will see your next lecture.
