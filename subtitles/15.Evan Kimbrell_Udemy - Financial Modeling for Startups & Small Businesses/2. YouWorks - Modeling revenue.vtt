1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:00.810
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.590
Now that we've done the sanity check we have an idea of the ballpark of where revenues should be.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.050
So let's see how we can build out the first 24 months in terms of the revenue.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.360
Okay.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.730
All right.

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.390
So let's take a look at our other worksheet right now and we're going to start with what we're given

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.610
right.

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.310
What we've done before which was to have 50000 square feet.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.370
We got the breakdown between the different kinds of space.

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.070
The total number of units are spots that we have.

11
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.800
OK.

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.220
Let's call column spots to be consistent.

13
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.810
Now then we talked about over subscription right.

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.020
So these were not over scribing we're just going to put a 100 percent because we're not allowed to.

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.350
But we're going to model it this way in case let's say changes.

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.040
Then we can actually change it in the model itself.

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.480
But right now we're in a set at 100 percent.

18
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.440
Then for the shared desk we're going to oversubscribed it.

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:11.100
But instead of 300 percent which probably aggressive you might then have too many people there and then

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.840
you know people are going to get pissed off.

21
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.150
You can't find a desk and it's too crowded.

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.720
So we're just going to oversubscribed by 100 percent which should give the utilization in the 60 or

23
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.860
70 percent range.

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.220
OK.

25
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.410
So it's going to be nice and cozy but it won't be completely packed all the time always.

26
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.650
All right.

27
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.200
Actual units available now.

28
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.750
Right.

29
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.510
Actual spots available is going to be the subscription percentage times the original number of spots.

30
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.020
OK.

31
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.330
So that's how many spots we're going to try to sell now.

32
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.560
Right.

33
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.630
So these are still the same.

34
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.750
It didn't change unless we change it here.

35
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.150
But right now we're going to keep that assumption the same.

36
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.550
And then for the rent options we're going to keep on with what we have we're going to have two fifty

37
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.650
three fifty five fifty and sixteen hundred.

38
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.160
OK.

39
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.150
Now the amount of time to lease up all these spots it's going to take some time.

40
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.720
OK.

41
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.500
So I mean to say to lease up those spots or to sell the spots but we'll call it least because they are

42
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.690
paying monthly they're not really buying it and owning it for life.

43
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.060
So then we may say hey this might take nine months.

44
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.350
OK.

45
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.070
So for best practices whenever you have something and you just have a number if it's not blatantly obvious

46
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.530
then add the units there so that you can refer to it in the future.

47
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.830
OK.

48
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.210
So we got nine months maybe it took six months to lease up the other ones or maybe it's just four months

49
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.520
to do these other offices.

50
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.290
Now this one we're because we're going to be oversubscribed.

51
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.570
We're not going to have any vacancy or wishing and expect to have any vacancy.

52
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.850
Right.

53
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.600
But for the other ones we're probably gonna have some vacancy just because there's usually some turnover

54
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.290
for this one might be really low since it's really popular.

55
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.490
And then for the small offices maybe it's a little bit higher it takes a little little bit longer to

56
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.570
find a tenant when there's turnover.

57
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.650
So we're going to make that assumption there.

58
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.570
OK.

59
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.960
In all right now when we start modeling things out we always want to look at the month.

60
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:26.730
So let's just put in the months OK and we're going to copy let's go all the way for you how many months

61
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.240
we have here.

62
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.510
All right.

63
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.840
So when I look at it for two years.

64
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.480
All right.

65
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.500
And you could do this longer if you want but we're just going to take a look for two years in this example

66
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.030
right now.

67
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.370
So then now let's think about occupancy let's say here.

68
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.130
It takes as you know these and this amount of time to get to this full subscription which you can think

69
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.020
of as occupancy as well.

70
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.850
How long does it take us to actually get there.

71
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.120
Right.

72
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.000
So and then assume that we kind of ramp up evenly during however long we specify here.

73
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.630
So in the first month the first month the actual occupancy we're just going to say is equal to the maximum

74
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.940
divided by how many months it takes to get to the maximum.

75
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.470
OK.

76
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.750
So that's kind of like the first month right.

77
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.870
First month to get there and then for the other months we're going to have to incrementally add.

78
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.310
Right.

79
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.090
And we will what are we going to add we're going to add that same difference depending on how many months

80
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.300
here it is to get to this.

81
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.540
OK.

82
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.710
So as a first part we're going to say we're going to add the previous plus the amount here.

83
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.960
We want to stick with this percentage here.

84
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.130
But with each row we wanted to go down so I'm going to fix the column but I'm going to let the row go

85
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.810
down in terms of the reference.

86
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.560
OK.

87
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.260
And then that divided by the number of months.

88
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.060
So that's how much we're incrementing.

89
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.240
Right.

90
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.860
And again we're gonna fix the column so it stays within that column when we copy the formulas across

91
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.780
the rows or across the columns here.

92
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.030
But when it moves down a row we want it to be referring to the correct numbers.

93
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.200
So what does that look like.

94
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.660
All right.

95
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.200
So then if we have this it should be doubling that.

96
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.440
Right.

97
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.230
And if we move it out it's it's going to double or triple and keep going.

98
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.460
Now here's something to notice this looks kind of higher than what we're supposed to have here.

99
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.070
Looks like everything's higher now.

100
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.540
OK well if we just keep adding indefinitely it will go past what you intend.

101
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.900
Right.

102
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.030
So one of the things that we can do is we want to keep adding this but we want to limited to this maximum.

103
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.790
So he's either gonna be something less than that or at most that much in the way we do that is use the

104
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.930
min function.

105
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.360
OK.

106
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.710
So it's kind of weird when you want at most something then we're gonna be using the min function when

107
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.420
you want at least something then we're going to be using the max function.

108
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.730
Okay.

109
00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:00.890
So to look at check the set minimum of this for the addition of what it is.

110
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.510
So if it's still in the ramp up months then it's going to look just like the way it's going to look.

111
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.430
But once it reaches the full ramp up month it's going to max out at whatever that limit is.

112
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.090
You see that now they are all maxed out.

113
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:25.280
So as expected these other ones reach 100 percent you know in the fourth month whereas these other ones

114
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.300
here it's going to be you know in the six month and the ninth month as we expected.

115
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.690
Okay.

116
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.250
You're going to copy this all the way out.

117
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.330
And now we have the occupancies for the all of these units.

118
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.310
Okay.

119
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.820
Once we have occupancy we can start thinking about the rents.

120
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.060
Right.

121
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.460
So rents here.

122
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.720
We're going to look at then is the number of desks right.

123
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.160
Times the full occupancy.

124
00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:04.100
So we're going to say the total number times the actual percentage that it's sold times the rental rate

125
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.840
per month.

126
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.030
So then what we then have is we have that formula here.

127
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.130
And what we can do is then we can copy the formula paste that there and then we have the other rents.

128
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:24.170
And when we do that and do it all the way across we see the rents going up it's going up as the occupancy

129
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.960
goes up.

130
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.580
Okay.

131
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.200
And then what we should see is it should stabilize at some point right where when everything's stabilized

132
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.710
and that's the max rate and everything else should stay the same.

133
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.280
So visually you can see when you're doing this correct or not.

134
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:45.490
Then just for a summary we can we can say the total here it's just the sum of all of those who are using

135
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.900
the sum function of this whole array here.

136
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.980
This set of numbers.

137
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.450
And that's where that is.

138
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:58.990
We can copy it and paste the rest to get it for each column and you'll see that the formula is adding

139
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.420
from the correct columns.

140
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.710
Okay.

141
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:06.130
Now as a quick summary since we're running it for two years it might be interesting to see what it looked

142
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.450
like for the whole entire year.

143
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.650
Right.

144
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.590
So how would we do that.

145
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.080
Well it should be pretty simple right.

146
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:17.260
We just want to add it up for the full year then we're just going to add some for the first 12 months.

147
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:26.470
So we just go like that and then for the next one we just goes from 13 to 24.

148
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.980
OK so now we have girls rents for year one in year two we see that year two is a lot more because well

149
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.710
it doesn't have that ramp up phase.

150
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.100
OK.

151
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.460
OK.

152
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.710
Then that's maximum possible.

153
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.130
Right.

154
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:45.480
But we know there seem to be some turnover based on what we put here for vacancies so we need to factor

155
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.420
that in in the way we calculate the vacancy is we take the gross rents and we multiply by the appropriate

156
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:58.290
vacancy number again we get to restrict the movement of the columns so that we're referring to the correct

157
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.500
sells and then a copy just the formulas.

158
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.430
The reason I'm doing that instead of just the other way is I wanted to keep this formatting here.

159
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.930
So then what we can do is we do the same across.

160
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.260
OK.

161
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.910
Now vacancy is a loss right.

162
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:17.130
So the better way to do this is actually to make this a negative number.

163
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:25.470
And then we're gonna re copy this formula and you can select this whole box and just paste the formula

164
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.670
again.

165
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:33.150
So now all the numbers are going to be negative but we want to show it in a way that makes it easier

166
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:34.560
visually.

167
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:41.070
So we're gonna go format cells and this is currency and we want to show a negative number with the negative

168
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.960
sign and red case and now.

169
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.760
Now it's very visible.

170
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.450
Right.

171
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.590
Then we look at the year one in year two again.

172
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:53.370
Now remember these formulas what we can do because it's all relative formulas we can actually just copy

173
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.170
this and it would actually give us the correct numbers.

174
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.310
Oh it does.

175
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.900
If you had add them first which we need to do we didn't add them in the total line yet.

176
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:12.870
So we're going to add that some of the vacancies here Okay great.

177
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.450
And for consistency make the numbers read so.

178
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:17.780
Okay.

179
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.870
Now we have the sums and then this sums up the vacancy totals.

180
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.950
So now and visually we can see that as well.

181
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.890
Okay so then net rents is going to be there.

182
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.610
GROSS rents offset by the vacancy rate.

183
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.110
So now we've got the gross rents plus the negative vacancy

184
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.500
so we're gonna pace the formulas only in the right here is just a pace it's on the home screen for depending

185
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.080
on what version of Excel you have.

186
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.320
You can usually go up pace and then you select the formula how you want to pace.

187
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:53.970
All right.

188
00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:00.940
So again we have that and we're going to some are going to some R numbers again.

189
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.010
We have that total and we're going copy and paste the formula across.

190
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:05.470
All right.

191
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:11.130
So now we have that in again we can copy our total for the year one in year two.

192
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:16.030
And now just from that we have year one year two net rents.

193
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.500
OK.

194
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.480
And actually a little bit higher than what we did in the sanity check.

195
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.160
Right.

196
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.210
This was a 2 9.

197
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.950
And with these assumptions here it's a lot more the reason for that is we're Hoover's scribing by 100

198
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.100
percent here.

199
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.820
If it's a little bit less maybe we're going to be even more conservative than it changes.

200
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.140
But it's still going to be more right than than what we were projecting before.

201
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.200
Just because it's had a lot of spots.

202
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.460
So now this allows us to test some of our assumptions you know maybe we can't charge as much for those

203
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.790
large offices maybe as only fourteen hundred.

204
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.040
Right.

205
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.550
Then then it changes the assumptions here and you'll see how it adjusts accordingly.

206
00:11:54.550 --> 00:12:02.380
So there you have it a you works shared co coworking space model the revenue model of it.

207
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:09.430
Now later in the case that he will we're going to revisit this we're going to put the expenses in the

208
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.850
cost side of this together so we can look at the full model.

209
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.070
This is a simple representation of this business model.

210
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.730
Obviously we've only looked at the top line revenue figures.

211
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.820
We didn't look at overhead or other expenses we didn't build out of cash flow statement.

212
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:30.520
We didn't look at startup costs that is needed in order to buy and build out this thing.

213
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:36.130
But we'll be revisiting this case later in the course and we're going to add all of those things together.

214
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:43.180
However there are still many revenue models out there and different ways to model growth and segmenting

215
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:49.810
users so we can cover a few more things first before we start building entire models.
