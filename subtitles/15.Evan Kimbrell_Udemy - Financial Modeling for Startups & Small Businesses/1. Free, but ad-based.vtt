00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.500
Hey guys and we are back in this section.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.140
Simon and I are going to break down in each lecture a different business model what they look like what

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.670
metrics they run off of and how we reflect that in our Excel models.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.690
Even if your business only fits into one of these categories I do suggest you still follow along because

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.950
it's really useful information and it does help you think critically about what goes into each business.

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.700
It kind of goes without saying that you should study business models in general to get better at them

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.010
versus just studying your business model a lot anyway in this lecture we're going to talk about the

8
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.160
free to the user but with display and model can you think of any off the top of your head what I'm talking

9
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.720
about.

10
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520
How about Facebook How about Twitter.

11
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.610
Pretty much anything that's free you've ever saw an ad on any newspaper ever.

12
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.880
Here's a fun fact.

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.630
Think about all the sites you use today.

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.170
How many of those did you actually pay for.

15
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.770
I'm going to guess that there are quite a few that let you spell long call overhead without ever asking

16
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.320
for your credit card number.

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.830
Well chances are these are the Web sites that we're talking about in this lecture.

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.470
I say chances are because if these sites like you know social networks forums blogs free mobile apps

19
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.870
whatever they don't charge you anything then chances are they make their money through ads or the other

20
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.150
option that no one wants to talk about selling your data.

21
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.230
Yes this is true and if you've ever applied to a company called fast web ads for scholarships the United

22
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.790
States will talk about this later.

23
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.670
In the end the case studies section that Web site is a search engine for college scholarships.

24
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.930
Ask a lot of information about you so they can match you.

25
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.660
But actually they just sell your information to loan companies all because they want to help kids and

26
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.270
that's why you keep getting mysterious mail from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

27
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.270
Anyway I digress.

28
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.630
We're back to ads.

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.420
Yes ads.

30
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.340
You've seen them.

31
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.990
They pay for things like Facebook Twitter Pinterest your favorite blog pretty much any digital media

32
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.110
like The New York Times Washington Post or CNN.

33
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.050
Go out on a limb here and kind of assuming that CNN gives at least 80 percent of that ad revenue to

34
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.000
whoever makes those ridiculous and over-the-top holograms that are on the screen all the time.

35
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.770
But anyway they're a great example.

36
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.210
Every time you go to their site there's a chance you might see an ad even if you didn't see one.

37
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.800
You might have shown one that you just didn't notice.

38
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.200
That's actually something we usually call native advertising which is a topic for a totally different

39
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.820
lecture.

40
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.280
So how does an ad based website or mobile application make itself run underneath the hood.

41
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.560
Well it's actually pretty simple.

42
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.650
You have a web or mobile property and your currency is going to be foot traffic.

43
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.300
Now you can pick and choose where and what types of ads to display but how you get paid will really

44
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.820
all come down to three different terms.

45
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.440
We have a cost per click.

46
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.430
It's also abbreviated a CPC cost per action which is abreviated a CPA and I'm going to reverse this

47
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.340
one on the last one the last one is abbreviated C.P am.

48
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.700
Can you guess what the M stands for.

49
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.280
Seriously there are marketers who've been running ads for 10 years and I don't even know if the and

50
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.780
CPM stands for.

51
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.990
It's not millions.

52
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.440
It's not man it is me me it.

53
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.180
I don't know Imai l l e.

54
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.550
Yes it's the French word for thousand minutes.

55
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.090
Yeah.

56
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.450
You know.

57
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.770
Moving on when someone loads your page on your app and they see an ad they just see it.

58
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.130
That is what we call an impression every time they see that.

59
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.430
And that is called an impression regardless of whether or not they've seen that particular before a

60
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.200
CPM therefore is the amount of money an advertiser pays for every.

61
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.870
Thousand impressions.

62
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.390
If a CPM of say is one dollar and you refresh a page a thousand times Congratulations you owe them a

63
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.930
dollar.

64
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.130
Now if the user decides to click on that ad that's called.

65
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.920
Can you guess it.

66
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.280
It's called a click.

67
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.200
Pretty simple.

68
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.690
The advertiser then pays you for the click.

69
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.410
The last one though is a little tricky and not used all the time where it's really actually not that

70
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.940
common but it's worth knowing.

71
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.600
Cost per action.

72
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.060
Let's say I clicked that out and then I went to their page and I either bought something or signed up

73
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.180
for their email list.

74
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.730
That's called into action.

75
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.860
And usually the advertiser defines what constitutes an action.

76
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.390
So every time someone clicks and and and then goes and does whatever it is that they wanted them to

77
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.960
do.

78
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.550
This is of course tracked on the advertisers site of course you the publisher would get paid.

79
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.970
Now this is totally extracurricular But why do we have three and why do we use all three.

80
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.420
And you know the answer to this.

81
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.720
Well the reason why we have all three is because of this Goldilocks kind of dynamic.

82
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:07.070
But clean them if an advertiser pays money for a thousand impressions how do they know those impressions

83
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.920
will translate into what they want.

84
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.980
Just like sales or clicks.

85
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.930
Now on the other side of the spectrum as a site owner why would I pay per action if I have no idea after

86
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.240
the click how attractive that site is.

87
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.720
And that leaves us with the one that's kind of in the middle.

88
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.650
The most popular by far is the cost per click what kind of solves both of these problems.

89
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.530
I as an advertiser I'm only on the hook for how effective you are getting people to click it and you

90
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.850
are only on the hook for getting people to click it.

91
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.530
Not how effective I am at getting them to buy something or sign up.

92
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.270
You can't just show ads to show them and you can't just pay someone every time you make a sale from

93
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.350
their traffic.

94
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.120
You've got to share the risk load.

95
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.230
Of course if you know the advertisers really well that's usually when you see people go with a CPA.

96
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.870
And if you think your ad is absolutely hilarious and you'll get tons of click anywhere then you might

97
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.330
actually go with the CPM because you can negotiate a better a better rate.

98
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.510
Anyway generally advertisers are going to pay you one or the other and any given site though you might

99
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.680
have ads running on say two different ad systems.

100
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.280
Ninety five percent of the cases you'll have see PCs and C-p EMS.

101
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.190
OK now there are two ingredients left and we're over the hump on this business model from a conceptual

102
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.290
standpoint.

103
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.260
Now the first of this last kind of straggler group is another lovely acronym we call C-T are which is

104
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:34.570
odd because it looks like it's three words but it's really I think two but it means click through rate

105
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.980
maybe click through.

106
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.740
Two words I've always seen it as one word.

107
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.070
I don't.

108
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.940
The squiggly line when I put it as one word so I don't know what that stands for is the percentage of

109
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.730
people that see an ad and then click on it.

110
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:52.970
That percentage can fluctuate violently and it entirely just depends on the group of people that see

111
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.990
it and how effective the ad is as well as the placement of the ad.

112
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.520
Now what is the last major ingredient in an ad based business model.

113
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.180
Well it is the number of people that you bring to your site.

114
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.860
The number that brings us all home.

115
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.490
Total visitors.

116
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.210
All right you got it.

117
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:18.200
Those are the five things we generally care about CPM cost per media CPC cost per click CPA cost per

118
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.420
action C-T are click through rate and then the last one the one that matters more than all the other

119
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.060
ones is just total visitors.

120
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.340
Your model will be built around these five concepts so make sure you understand them.

121
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:35.300
Okay lets look at what this looks like in actual practice and see how it gets reflected in our model.

122
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.460
All right see you later.

123
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.130
Hey now before we actually go and build the revenue model.

124
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.630
Its a good idea to do some sanity checks right.

125
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.850
So for something like this you may do a sanity check around some sort of a target revenue.

126
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.650
How much can you reasonably expect for a certain amount of traffic to say or say you have a site thats

127
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:08.210
in a certain vertical and you want to see based on you know industry known and she CPM and CBC's what

128
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.860
the expected revenue could be for your site given a certain amount of visitors.

129
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:21.890
So here we can start from the top down in the yellow cells again are going to be inputs into your simple

130
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.660
model here.

131
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.350
And then the grey cells here are going to be the formulas.

132
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.840
Okay.

133
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:36.150
So lets say you think you can get to 2 and a half million visitors unique visitors per per month.

134
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.810
Okay.

135
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:43.160
And you know that in your Vergel you got your hands on some industry data for that particular vertical

136
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.210
and you know that the click rates range from a quarter percent to close just under 2 percent.

137
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.240
You know to be conservative you may do half a percent.

138
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.700
So based on that traffic the number of visitors your total impressions are CPM which is measured in

139
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:10.700
the thousands is going to equal to the visitors divided by 1000 right now and then the number of click

140
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.350
through is going to be the visitors times the click through rate right here.

141
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.400
Okay.

142
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:25.520
So you have these numbers now and again maybe industry data you're going to know that the range for

143
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.510
the CPM is between 1 and $2 or so to be conservative.

144
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.290
Maybe you put it on the lower in dollar 2.5.

145
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:38.630
And then for the CPC maybe put it at $2.

146
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:47.210
So then the revenue that you can expect from both of these is going to be the rate times the corresponding

147
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:48.570
figures right.

148
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.940
So for impressions is going to be the impressions times the CPA.

149
00:09:52.370 --> 00:10:00.380
And then for the click through is going to be the number of click through those times the cost that

150
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.690
you're able to charge.

151
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:09.350
So then your revenue your total revenue is going to be the sum of those two.

152
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:17.240
So if you had you know this kind of expectation in terms of traffic but you're you're you were expecting

153
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.290
quarter million in monthly revenue than from just a quick exercise like this.

154
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.910
You would see that you're kind of out of the ballpark right.

155
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.040
You know you could play with these assumptions to see how that would affect you right.

156
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:35.460
So if you're you're on the low end of click through rates then you're looking at something like that.

157
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.920
But if you're on the higher end then you might get to six figures according to this formula.

158
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.390
Right.

159
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.760
So this is a pretty quick way to do a sanity check.

160
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.150
Right now once you have something like this.

161
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:58.790
Another useful method to kind of visualize two variables and say like the results is to do something

162
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.110
called a table.

163
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:01.540
OK.

164
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:11.510
So let's take a look right now here what I have structured is jus the different click through rates

165
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.940
from the range of points you 5 percent all the way to one point ninety five percent.

166
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.750
Okay.

167
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:24.830
And here is some assumptions about monthly visitors that we can put whatever values we want.

168
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:31.940
I just want to provide a pretty wide range here for us to see then what you can do is in this corner

169
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:39.320
here where these values are you want it to equal to the value that you want to look at.

170
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.410
That's of interest.

171
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.750
Right so in our case it's going to be the monthly revenue.

172
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.310
Okay.

173
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:49.760
Now the reason nothing shows up here is I make the font white instead of having something there it just

174
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.090
looks better.

175
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.740
You'll understand what I mean when I show you this.

176
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.420
So I'm going to just make the font white or doesn't show up there.

177
00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:04.540
So then what happens is I have two variables that are related to generating this monthly revenue figure.

178
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:10.660
Right now I want to see how the monthly revenue figure changes depending on all of these combinations

179
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.940
of quick rate percentages versus monthly visitors.

180
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:20.910
So in each box it gives me the monthly revenue for that given set of click rates and monthly visitors.

181
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:25.510
So we do that is you select this whole box including the corner here.

182
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:34.130
And then what you do is you go to data you go to a what if now different versions of Excel might have

183
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.280
slightly different ways of looking at it.

184
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.730
So you're going to have to find out where that data table is located for your version of Excel.

185
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:47.050
I'm using 2011 right now which is quite popular but if you have a newer version this will be even easier.

186
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.350
So you click on data table and what's going to happen is is going to give you this little dialogue.

187
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.380
And it says row input cell and column input so.

188
00:12:54.410 --> 00:13:00.820
So for us the row input cell right here these rows are the monthly visitors right.

189
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:07.820
So we're going to set it equals to the visitors here and then the column in Purcell's the click through

190
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.170
rates are we going to set it to the click through rate.

191
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:10.550
OK.

192
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:18.190
So you see that now that we have those if I click OK is going to generate this table for us.

193
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:26.540
Now it's colored because I had set a conditional formatting here to just to for us to see it visually

194
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.460
better otherwise it would just be a table with plain white.

195
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.880
OK.

196
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:36.290
But what you can see then is instead of having to plug all these values in separately here all these

197
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.770
different values to see what the monthly revenue would be.

198
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.800
You could quickly visualize what that would look like for all of these combinations.

199
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:52.610
Right so if you had a 2 percent click through it and you get 50 million visitors then with these assumptions

200
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:59.420
for that for the average you know CPM and the CPC that you're charging this is the monthly revenue that

201
00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.830
you can expect or ad revenue you can expect.

202
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.110
Right.

203
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.270
So here are all the combinations given these assumptions.

204
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.820
It's good to put it here.

205
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:12.050
The assumptions that you're also assuming so you know what you're looking at you're looking at these

206
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.610
combinations under these assumptions here we can do the same thing with different variables.

207
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:16.910
Right.

208
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.600
So we had another variable.

209
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:25.070
What if we what if we change what we're trying to do but we're we want to keep the visitors in the click

210
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:25.820
through rate the same.

211
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.690
But we want to see what would happen with different combinations of CPC and CPM.

212
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.580
So you could do the same right.

213
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:36.730
So this here the cell in the corner is equal to the revenue.

214
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:43.330
And then what I do now I made a bigger bigger box here and again you can select this whole thing and

215
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:49.730
I'm going to go back to data what if scenario data table now has this dialogue again.

216
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.990
Right.

217
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.620
So then we get to go back to the formula.

218
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.440
So our top one is CPM right.

219
00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:02.440
So then sort of roll input is going to be the CPM one a column on a CPC.

220
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.310
And then we go back to the table and push OK.

221
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.700
It's going to generate another table for us.

222
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.470
OK.

223
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:15.520
So here then we can see hey with this traffic assumption you know two and a half million visitors at

224
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.480
a point five percent click through rate these combinations.

225
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:26.110
Any of these combinations of CPC or CPM that you're going to charge that's the monthly expected revenue

226
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.600
that you can expect.

227
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:34.570
So you can see with you know simple model and using the data table you can quickly kind of get yourself

228
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:40.780
a range to see where you are in the ballpark and quickly test what you're looking at.

229
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.080
All right.

230
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.840
Next let's actually build the model here.

231
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.960
OK so what we're looking at here is a set up with we're just looking at 12 months.

232
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:52.420
Okay.

233
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.160
12 months of time.

234
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.190
And then here are the visitors.

235
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.480
Let's say we're assuming that it's going to take us 12 months to get to our target.

236
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.670
What you put in the front.

237
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.170
Okay.

238
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.540
Which was two and a half million users.

239
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:12.190
So then every month before that we're kind of building up the the visitors to this site that you have

240
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.270
toward building up and then we're assuming some click through rate.

241
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:21.150
So if we want to assume the same quick through rate then we could just eat boules to what we have here

242
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.910
assumed that point five percent.

243
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:30.040
Okay then for us to calculate the total impressions for each of the months what we have is we take the

244
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:36.700
visitors for that month and we're assuming that they're only visiting once right now okay these unique

245
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.680
visitors we're not assuming they're visiting multiple times now or assuming they're only visiting once

246
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:42.990
okay per visitor.

247
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.000
So we have that divided by 1000.

248
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.000
Right so each of them is only visiting one time so.

249
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.040
So we have these CMs.

250
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:58.900
So one way to make it easier is if you're only using this many columns is to get rid of all the other

251
00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.380
columns.

252
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.700
You select them you right click and then you hide them.

253
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.750
And that way you can kind of skip around from the front to the back by using either command arrow if

254
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.830
you're on a Mac or control Errol's to move back and forth.

255
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:20.140
So here we have this formula we can copy and paste this for the rest of the months and we will have

256
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:26.890
the calculations so we see that each one is the visitors divided by 1000 right for the CPM and click

257
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.770
through rate is going to be the number of visitors.

258
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:37.780
And we're also assuming that they're only visiting each site the site once a month so each visitors

259
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.840
want impression as well.

260
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.770
Then we have the visitors times the click through rate.

261
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.650
So you've got to look at what you're doing if it makes sense or not.

262
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:49.930
Any time you're doing it don't just keep doing it without thinking about whether it looks correct or

263
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:50.250
not.

264
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.880
OK so we have this formula.

265
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.950
We have the click through rate times the visitors right.

266
00:17:55.150 --> 00:18:00.500
If I just copy this formula and move it across we're going to have an error here.

267
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.010
OK I can show you just in the second month.

268
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.560
See that it's going to have a 0.

269
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.370
Now what's going on here.

270
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:13.480
So here you see it's referring to this empty cell is because when we copy the formula the formula is

271
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.880
moving with it.

272
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:21.200
So one way in Excel to make sure that when we're copying the formula.

273
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.950
If we want this reference to this cell to be fixed it's called an absolute reference and it doesn't

274
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.810
move.

275
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:35.670
Then we want to put something like the dollar signs in front of the column and the row.

276
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.780
Not a hash tag but the dollar signs like that.

277
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:47.320
OK so we have the dollar signs in front of the column D and row 7 we're going to fix it and then push

278
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:47.590
enter.

279
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:53.590
Now when I copy this formula to here you can hover the lower right corner when it changes the crosshairs

280
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.980
and pull it over copy.

281
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.890
So we look at this formula and now we see that it's referencing it correctly.

282
00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.850
OK.

283
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:07.550
Now we can pretty much just copy and paste the formula to the rest of the cells.

284
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.210
OK.

285
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:14.740
So then we are also going to need our assumptions for your average CPI CPM and your CPC that you're

286
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.410
charging right.

287
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:23.550
So we take the same assumptions from the front which is make it equal to those and the other one we

288
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.150
can make it equal to the CPC one right here.

289
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:27.720
OK.

290
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.670
So we have these two assumptions that now we can calculate the revenue.

291
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.870
So the CPM revenue is going to equal to the impressions or the thousand impressions that you have times

292
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:44.340
your average CPM price right but we want to make it again in absolute reference so we're going to add

293
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.370
those dollar signs right there.

294
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.210
Okay.

295
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.530
And now we're going to do the same with the CPC except we're going to have to click through those times

296
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.570
the CPC.

297
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:54.800
Okay.

298
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.330
And then again you're going to add the dollar signs for that reference.

299
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.310
So once you have that well we can do is we can copy these two cells and we select the rest that's in

300
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.140
that category.

301
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.530
And then we're going to paste it.

302
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:09.480
And so we have these calculations and it should be growing right with the visitors growing over time

303
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.640
we'll see that hey we're going to be growing the revenue for both.

304
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.840
And then so then the monthly revenue which is going to be the sum of these two.

305
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.210
Right.

306
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:26.720
Can you just add them up like this or you can use a function in Excel some and just select the both

307
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.800
of those cells that you want some in.

308
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.460
I recommend using the suffix.

309
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.950
A lot of times you're going to have more than two things you're trying to some would if you have a lot

310
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.590
you don't want to be selecting each of those cells individually.

311
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.030
Right so if you get some you get just select the whole selection that range and then it would do it

312
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.420
for you.

313
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:48.390
And we can copy in pace now some of you might have noticed there was a little message in this corner

314
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.250
that's no longer there.

315
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.820
The reason I put something there is I want to check to see if I did it right in the 12th month with

316
00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:01.980
this these visitors and if these assumptions are exactly the same as the front monthly revenue should

317
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.600
equal to what's in the front.

318
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.130
Right.

319
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.590
So here it says twenty thousand one hundred twenty five.

320
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.080
And here it says the same.

321
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:14.640
It's right now I don't want to be able to I don't want to have to look back and forth between those

322
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:23.400
things so what I can do is I can create a little check for myself the way I do that is do an if statement

323
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:29.440
and if statement is something that Excel provides that allows you to check a condition if it's true

324
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.650
then do this.

325
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.330
And if not do something else.

326
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:40.500
So what I'm going to check for the first part of the logical test is if this is equal to that thing

327
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.670
in the front then I can put a.

328
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.720
OK.

329
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.940
And if not I can put error.

330
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:56.160
Ok so now that I close it it's going to have this a ok if I change something from here and it's not

331
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.630
using the assumptions from the back.

332
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.990
What we're going to see is it's going to show an error here right.

333
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.440
So let's let's just change this for now and we're going to make it $3.

334
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.920
You see that now it shows an error here.

335
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.470
So that's a good way to do error checking when you build models.

336
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.010
Easy way to do that.

337
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.560
So I'm going to push this back.

338
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.090
And so there you go.

339
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:24.060
In just a few short minutes you're able to build a simple revenue model to represent what it might look

340
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.160
like for an ad driven destination.
