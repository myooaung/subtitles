00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey guys welcome to the first actual doing something lecture of the course.

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.770
We're going to throw you into your first shot at modeling something if you're not sure where your skills

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.770
lie with regards to modeling or you're just rusty consider the next lectures a warm up that you can

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
just follow along with through the next five lectures.

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.260
We'll take this first model and we'll slowly expand it in complexity modeling really is a learn by doing

6
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.500
skill and that's how we intend to teach this course.

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.770
So with that let's try a classic but deceptively simple example the lemonade stand.

8
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.710
For those of you that didn't grow up in heartland America lemonade stands are the quintessential business

9
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.180
you as a child might have attempted to conquer one hot weekend afternoon.

10
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.840
And why not.

11
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.260
It's relatively simple laminate is something that only needs a handful of ingredients it takes no specialized

12
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.130
skills to make.

13
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.790
It's fairly straightforward.

14
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.910
And as a bonus it doesn't have the same stigma as its toxic brother in law could.

15
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.490
Oh no.

16
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.380
So the first thing in any modeling job that we suggest you do is is it pulled out a fresh Excel sheet.

17
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.710
Is it signed up for a pro subscription of error table.

18
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.280
No not just add it's actually just to sit down and try to think of and list out all of the things that

19
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.860
you know might be involved in the business.

20
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.580
Once you have everything written out you can cross off the things you don't find relevant.

21
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.830
You can add in the elements you find necessary later on and then you can hone in on each individual

22
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.860
item to then start the process of building out the model.

23
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.420
So what's involved in a lemonade stand.

24
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.480
Remember you're just selling easy mix.

25
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.250
Eliminate juice at a table primarily to people that are walking by.

26
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.680
Let's start off with the simple stuff the product.

27
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.890
What goes into the product what goes into each actual cup of liquid profit.

28
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.520
Well we have no one water that thing your doctor says you need to drink more of.

29
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.720
Number two we have sugar because how else are you going to make an all natural drink unhealthy.

30
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.740
The number three we have lemons.

31
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.520
Yes you could opt instead for the more cost conscious lemon drink in which case we would just swap out

32
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.580
the lemons for a cancer packet of lemon flavoring.

33
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.020
But we're just going to keep it simple for now.

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.000
The way Mother Nature intended minus the gallon of extra sugar.

35
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.130
So those are the three main ingredients.

36
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.590
What else goes into a lemonade.

37
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.790
Anything we can think of.

38
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.990
Well most likely you'll want to include ice if you ever tried lemonade warm.

39
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.530
You know it's really not the same thing.

40
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.820
OK.

41
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.540
So we got lemons sugar water and ice.

42
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.610
I mean we are ready to rumble.

43
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.450
No we need to now think about how we're going to make the product.

44
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.230
What do you think we would need to make and serve the actual drink.

45
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.320
Most likely we need to have a lemon juicer.

46
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.730
Yes you could outsource the live in squeezing to your younger brother but we're obviously trying to

47
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.430
build this into a multibillion dollar unicorn.

48
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.770
So that's just not scalable.

49
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.210
How many brothers do you have.

50
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.800
What else can we think of anything else.

51
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.830
Well we'll probably need a pitcher and some cups.

52
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.230
OK.

53
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.960
Now we have a way of delivering the product.

54
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.860
But remember this is a store front enterprise.

55
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.070
So we probably have some fixed costs associated with getting up and running.

56
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.640
We probably need a table maybe a chair an umbrella so you can keep the product moderately cool.

57
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.390
And if you decide to hire later on you can meet the mandatory labor conditions standards so that's a

58
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.470
plus.

59
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.670
That reminds me you'll probably do well with a cooler as well so you can store the supplies in any of

60
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.790
the other premade drinks.

61
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.480
Anything else you can think of.

62
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.810
How about a sign to get attention and inform people that you're not just sitting there loitering staring

63
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.950
at traffic for no reason.

64
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.080
Last thing I can think of is probably a cashbox to store your sales.

65
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.340
OK.

66
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.260
Now our list of things we just need got larger.

67
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.510
We can make the product.

68
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.980
We can how is the product.

69
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.820
We can establish a store front.

70
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.530
And we have a way of pulling off some rudimentary advertising.

71
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.340
The next thing that's worth pondering and mapping out is the business model itself.

72
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.220
Business model as a refresher is just how you make money in a given business.

73
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.720
Well in this case we're not selling online subscriptions the lemonade.

74
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.350
We're selling the actual thing to people that walk by.

75
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.350
Since my customers are the passer by.

76
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.460
Is it safe to assume that all of them are going to buy from me.

77
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.360
Well no it's reasonable to think that a hearty portion will probably not.

78
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.670
In fact some will just walk right past you and some will at least go to your table before snubbing you.

79
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.950
So we're probably going to need to keep track of things like how many customers walk by how many stopped

80
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.350
by your table and then how many people at the end of this all this whole thing do they actually buys.

81
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.680
All right.

82
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.190
So we've effectively mapped out the basic form of eliminate stand.

83
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.110
Nothing groundbreaking yet.

84
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.620
Sure you probably knew most of that over the next set of lectures.

85
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.800
We'll address what happens when we expand our product line and what happens when we try to expand in

86
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.080
general next lecture.

87
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.570
We'll tackle a crucial concept worth understanding unit economics.

88
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.820
All right.

89
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.340
See you then.
