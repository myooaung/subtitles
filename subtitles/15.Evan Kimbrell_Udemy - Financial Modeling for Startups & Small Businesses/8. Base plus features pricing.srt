00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,710
Hey welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,750
In this lecture we're going to talk about the base plus features revenue model.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,310
So think about a car dealership or a car manufacturer.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:17,430
They have a base model that you've got to pay a base price for and there's a number sometimes dozens

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,960
of independent features that you can purchase as a customer you can select to add this or that and any

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,440
combination of things.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,920
So if you have a business model where you have something like that where customers want to buy some

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,020
sort of a base model of something and they have all these features that they can independently add what

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,310
would that model look like.

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,560
So in this lecture I'm going to show you how to build that out how to factor in the different combinations

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,390
and how to factor that in so that you can build out the revenue model for something like this.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,970
Let's take a look.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,900
All right let's take a look at a quick sanity check for a business model that has some sort of a base

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,260
product or based service and then where people can add features right.

15
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:10,020
And let's look at an example where maybe we have a base product that costs $10000.

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:18,420
And there are some features a B and C that are all independent and have their own prices so the potential

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,710
customers could buy any combination of these features from none to or three to any other combination

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,580
in between.

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,020
And when we look at a business model like this we might start with something where you know there's

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,700
going to be some sales pitch right.

21
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:42,540
These are higher price higher ticket type of products so it's going to be a more involved selling process

22
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,440
usually might involve some sort of one on one sales call or something like that.

23
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,170
So we can assume something that's higher touch.

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:58,080
Okay and maybe out of ten thousand pitches they sell 8 percent you know able to convert 8 percent of

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:05,160
them into purchases of the base product and then out of those some percentage of those are going to

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,930
make some purchase of a combination of the features.

27
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,520
So here I'm just structuring this in such a way where we can sort of visualize what that might look

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:22,500
like and if there's 10000 sales pitches and 100 based purchases here then we can see what the revenues

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,120
look like.

30
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,680
Now of course when we start modeling out we've got to see you know what that is in terms of the timeline

31
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:35,220
but gives you an idea you know if if you're making a 100 sales in a given year then your revenues are

32
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,070
going to look something like this where there's that much in base based revenue and then the rest coming

33
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,780
from premium cells.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,230
So if we're going to model this out say over the first 12 months we might structure something like this.

35
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:57,000
All right let's assume we're able to get a certain number of sales pitches every month and you're able

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,560
to consistently convert some percentage of them into base purchases.

37
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,340
Right.

38
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,860
And we have this data here that's the same as what we're assuming in the front.

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,390
Some base purchase price the premium feature prices and then what combination what percentage of those

40
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,150
that are customers would end up buying any of these combination of premium features.

41
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,590
So here I'm assuming 75 percent are going to buy some at least one premium feature.

42
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,900
But you know a quarter of them are just going to stick with the base model.

43
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:37,350
So then when we have that what we can then see is let's look at how many customers fall into any of

44
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,650
these given combinations.

45
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,120
We can take a look here and start doing this.

46
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,200
We are going to take the numbers who are making based purchases and then we're going to multiply by

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,410
the percentages that fall into each of the combinations right here.

48
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:02,480
So base in a will be that 1 5 percent only right because it's only 8.

49
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,310
And then we can kind of go down the line and have it matched this way now.

50
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,840
We do need to fix that again to have the reference correctly.

51
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,660
And so now we have these breakdowns we can see the customers that are going to fall into each of these.

52
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,160
Okay.

53
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,140
So every month we're getting these kinds of purchases.

54
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,990
Now once we have that the next thing we get to do is calculate the revenues.

55
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,630
So because we have these three different features and we're going to be looking at the premium revenue

56
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,240
for all of these combinations.

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,240
One technique that makes a little bit easier is to create what are called dummy variables here.

58
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,700
They're kind of like on off you can think of it as on off for these features.

59
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,130
OK.

60
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,260
Now you'll see why this kind of makes more sense when we start to actually do this.

61
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,500
So for example for basename only they want to look at the features.

62
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,640
Then I only turned 8 on and then it turned off other features by putting a zero so a 1 means it's a

63
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,610
feature that's included in a zero means the feature is not included.

64
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,720
Right so we can look at all the combinations here.

65
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,070
We get all zeros or ones and all the combinations of you know having two of them on or only one of them

66
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,440
on.

67
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:23,650
Then what we're going to do is then the actual revenue for the premium revenue is going to equal to

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,120
the number of customers that are in that combination for that month.

69
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,580
Right.

70
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,250
Times the.

71
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,150
And we're going to use something called a some product or some product function basically allows us

72
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,210
to do this multiplication of these two arrays or two sets.

73
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,780
I'm going to take this first array here.

74
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,370
Now I mean a set is so that all the references always stay with this box.

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,670
Right.

76
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,560
So I'm fixing the column references but will move down when I move formulas down.

77
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:01,730
And the other box that I want to reference to that's going to multiply against is the prices.

78
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,880
Now I'm going to fix that completely because everything needs to refer to this one and none of it none

79
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,930
of the references to this box should change right.

80
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,910
So that's why I have the dollar signs in front of the rows and columns.

81
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,980
So when we multiply these two or have a sum product what it's saying is we're going to take the first

82
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,810
elements multiply them together and then take the second elements multiply them together and then the

83
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,210
third element multiply them together and then add it.

84
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:32,140
So you take the sum of all the products and what the ones and zeroes does is it allows me to easily

85
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:39,400
then just take the correct price for the combination here by just putting ones and zeros right.

86
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,690
So if I have just the one for feature then I know the sum product is equal to 1 times to ninety nine

87
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,900
and then the rest are going to be zeros so only that two ninety nine is going to come in.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,620
And then this is the correct price times the number of customers we're buying.

89
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,300
That option only.

90
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,180
So then we have that calculation.

91
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,880
And so three times 299 equals to 97.

92
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,190
Now if we take this to the other ones we should have the right kind of combinations here.

93
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,640
Right.

94
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,320
So we see this one it's zero none zero.

95
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,330
There's nothing that we put that there just so we have we're able to look at it.

96
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,520
But the calculation could just easily be zero.

97
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,350
So we copy this out.

98
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:25,450
Now we have the premium revenues for each of the combinations right.

99
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:35,710
So then our total base revenue is equal to the total number of customers or 8 times the base purchase

100
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,280
price.

101
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,190
And then our total premium revenue is equal to the sum of the premium revenues here.

102
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,890
And then the total revenue will just be the sum of these two.

103
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,870
So then if we take the wrasse now we have this revenue projections for a business model that has 3 has

104
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,310
a base product and three premium features that are independent.

105
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,200
And if you have the combination of you know how many customers are falling into each.

106
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,540
It's relatively easy to calculate the rest.

107
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,540
The new thing you're learning here is the utilization of what are called these dummy variables.

108
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,020
So this really doesn't mean anything other than the fact that it's useful for our calculation.

109
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,790
Now we've looked at many different revenue models.

110
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,480
And this is by no means an exhaustive list.

111
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,810
It's just to give you an example of the different options that are out there and sometimes just changing

112
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,950
things as simply as the labeling and a few little things can help your model represent an entirely different

113
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,960
business model.

114
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,900
Now there is going to be some of you that are coming up with business models that are even created yet.

115
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,170
But when you look at the examples here and especially when you look at the case that is later you're

116
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,890
going to find bits and pieces that are going to pull from to create your own.

117
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,110
So we hope this gives you an idea of where to start.

118
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:04,240
Now next up we're going to take a look at the other side of the equation all the costs and the expenses

119
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,770
side.

120
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,370
All right.

121
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,370
SIEV-X.
