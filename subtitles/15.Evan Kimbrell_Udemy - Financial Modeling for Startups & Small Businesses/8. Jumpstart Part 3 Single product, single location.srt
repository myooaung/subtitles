00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,110
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:10,170
In the last lecture Evan walk you through how we arrive at the detailed cost economics of a single cup

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,350
of lemonade.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,790
And he showed you how to calculate how many cups you'd need to sell in order to achieve a certain profit

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,620
per hour of time that you put into this bad boy.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,010
We know our cost economics.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,110
Eighty nine cents per cup and the price point we want to sell it at 250.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,220
But how much you sell will depend on the location that you choose.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,110
Some locations might have more potential customers some other locations might have customers who are

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,720
more ready to buy.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,360
So you scoped out three potential locations.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,460
You tracked and measured the foot traffic.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,260
The number of people who stopped that food and drink stands and the portion of those who actually made

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,340
purchases.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,910
You also made a note that some customers bought more than one while others but just one thing.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,030
Now the data is different for all these locations but there is a difference.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,530
And you think that could make a difference for your business.

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,210
So let's see how we would do that model it out to choose the right location.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,150
So we are looking at the per cup cost economics.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,880
So in the previous lecture we talked about the individual items that make up the lemonade cup right

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,260
the ice the water and the sugar the juice still them and garnish the cup that holds the napkins and

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,760
the straws we have the bulk purchase costs.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,840
We have the cost per unit or the cost per ounce and then the costs in it.

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,950
In the cup or in the single cup of lemonade.

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:54,520
So we arrived that about eighty one cent per costs per cup but we wanted to add some padding because

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,040
there might be some spillage of water or waste of sugar and make some lemons might not juice as well

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
whatever that may be we're gonna put a 10 percent padding to that.

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,030
So now our final cost per cup is eighty nine cents.

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,180
Next let's do a sanity check given what we know now.

30
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,390
Right.

31
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:24,090
So if we know we want to charge a per cup price of 250 and our cost is eighty nine cents from what we

32
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,840
found and let's say we want to have a certain desire profit per day Okay we're gonna put two thousand

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,940
in there right now and we know on average we're going to operate for five hours a day.

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,210
Okay.

35
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,580
So then what would be our desired profit per hour.

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,990
Well that's going to equal to our profit per day that we desire the two thousand divided by the hours

37
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,230
we're going to operate per day.

38
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,430
Right.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,840
So it's 400 dollars in profit per hour.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,880
Now given that how many cups do we have to sell per hour in order to make 400 dollars a profit.

41
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:13,470
So we're gonna take the desired profits per hour then we're gonna divide it by the profit per cup which

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,650
is going to equal to the price minus the cost per cup.

43
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:28,710
So when we have this now he calculates the number of cups we need to sell in an hour in order to make

44
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,020
the desired profit.

45
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:39,540
So that's number they're two hundred and forty eight cups per hour which amounts to when we divide by

46
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,220
60 four cups per minute.

47
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,790
Do you think you can sell a cup every 15 seconds.

48
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,040
Probably not.

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,870
This desire profits is likely to be very aggressive not realistic.

50
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,070
Right.

51
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,700
What if we wanted to make two hundred fifty dollars in profit per hour now how many cups do we need

52
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,900
to sell per minute.

53
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,770
About half a cup maybe we sell about a cup every two minutes.

54
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,440
That sounds a lot more reasonable right.

55
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:20,190
So you can see from some simple calculations like this you can know right away if your assumptions are

56
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,800
in the ballpark of being real or not.

57
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,470
All right.

58
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,340
Now that you have the sanity checking your cost economics let's look at how we might choose among three

59
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,160
locations.

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,360
Right.

61
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,520
So for each location we have these data points.

62
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,330
We know what the foot traffic is per hour because we measure did we know the stop percentage because

63
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:51,830
we measured it and observed it with the Food and Beverage stands in those locations.

64
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,240
We also notice of the people who made stops.

65
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,650
How many of them actually made purchases.

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:57,870
Right.

67
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:05,790
So some locations had lower foot traffic but had higher stop percentage and purchase percentages as

68
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:13,890
in location A whereas Location C for instance has higher foot traffic but slower stop percentage same

69
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,950
purchase percentage just lower stopped percentage.

70
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,500
Now if we assume that the cost per cup is going to be the same for all three locations they're going

71
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,070
to have the same lemonade recipe and let's assume that they are going to sell for the same price as

72
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,330
well in all three locations.

73
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,380
Right.

74
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:41,180
And if they have the same hours of operation and also have the same average cups sold per purchase.

75
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,580
Now some people were going to come and buy more than a cup.

76
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,630
Not all of them just as some of them they won't want to get it for a friend.

77
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,590
Right.

78
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,620
So you're gonna make that assumption here as well.

79
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,860
Then with all of this these assumptions let's see what the economics look like for each location so

80
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,900
we might be able to pick a better location.

81
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,720
So let's start with the top line assumption which is the foot traffic per hour.

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,380
This one you already observed that so we'll just take it from the measurements from that roll and put

83
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,840
pull it down here.

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,140
That way we can kind of see it closer as we do more calculations.

85
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,210
Now the percentage of stops.

86
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,790
Again we observe that as well.

87
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:29,800
So we're even just equal make it equal to Road 3 for each of the columns here and the average stops

88
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,850
per hour is going to equal to the average traffic per hour times the stop percentage.

89
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:45,390
So when we have that we're gonna get the average stops per hour.

90
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:52,080
Now we're going to copy this formula when you highlight a cell in Excel at the bottom right corner you

91
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,230
see it turn to like a black crosshair from white that's when you've selected it and you're able to drag

92
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,060
it across and it will copy the formula there.

93
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,340
So it calculates for the other columns as well and you'll see that it's making the correct references

94
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,240
to each column.

95
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:23,120
Now if you're not familiar with Excel pause this real quick and Google relative versus absolute references.

96
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,150
Okay.

97
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,070
And you know what I mean.

98
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,680
Percentage that makes a purchase.

99
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,380
Well this one we also observe it up here.

100
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,620
Right.

101
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:41,240
So we're gonna have it equal to the row for just so we can see it clearly here.

102
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:50,480
And then the first the average number of purchases is going to equal to the stops per hour times the

103
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,420
percentage of the stops that actually purchase.

104
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,240
So now we have these purchase calculations.

105
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,430
Now again we're gonna copy that formula across the other cells because the economics work exactly the

106
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,050
same way.

107
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,280
Right.

108
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,880
Okay.

109
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,100
So we have the average purchases per hour and we got the average number of cups per purchase.

110
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:18,830
Now we can get an idea of the average cups per sold per hour which is the number of purchases per hour

111
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:27,400
times the average number of cups per purchase.

112
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,120
So that's how many cups we're gonna sell per hour in each of these locations.

113
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:42,230
Now given those assumptions then over the course of a five hours of selling it's that times the number

114
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,060
of hours.

115
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,700
Right.

116
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,630
And we pull that across.

117
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,030
Okay.

118
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,420
So now we can start looking at revenue and profits.

119
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,380
So let's look at the gross revenue per our gross revenue power is going to equal to the number of cups

120
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:08,180
sold for our times the price for cup and then the average gross profit per hour is going to equal to

121
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:17,120
the number of cups sold for our times the profit per cup which is going to equal to the price per cup

122
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,940
minus the cost per cup

123
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:38,700
now if we copy this formula across we'll see that the location a right now has the highest expected

124
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,680
profit per hour.

125
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,650
OK so if we look at it for the whole day since all the other assumptions are going to be the same we

126
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,280
should see similar results.

127
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,540
Right.

128
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:56,860
But instead of cost per hour is going to be cups sold for the whole five hour day.

129
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,530
OK.

130
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:09,860
So that times the price and then is the cup sold in a whole day times the profit per cup

131
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,050
so that's the profit for the day.

132
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,450
Okay

133
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,080
and if we copy that across highlight both of those cells and go to the bottom right corner and drag

134
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,680
it across it will calculate for the other columns as well.

135
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,950
So now we have this calculation here.

136
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,320
What if we change some of our assumptions.

137
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,600
Right.

138
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,230
What if location C we were wrong about the stop percentage.

139
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,030
It was just that day there was something going on.

140
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,430
But on average people walk a lot slower and they stop just as frequently as location a.

141
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,660
So if we make that change here you'll see the calculations at the bottom change immediately.

142
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,570
Now there's a big difference right.

143
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,290
Because if the stop percentage is the same as location and the purchase percentage is same but it has

144
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,590
almost twice the traffic we expect that the profit is almost twice.

145
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,650
Location A.

146
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:18,360
So you can see when you structure a simple analysis like this it can allow you to pick the right location.

147
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:26,790
What if we change this back to 15 percent but location C is able to operate more hours.

148
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:34,750
So now we see that the hourly profit it's kind of in the middle but it's day full day operation profit

149
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,270
is gonna be more just because it operates three more hours than the other locations.

150
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:40,570
Right.

151
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,520
So this gives you an idea of what you can expect from each of the locations

152
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,500
we're going gonna put that back in.

153
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,770
We're going to move forward to building the actual model.

154
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,370
All right.

155
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:55,700
Great.

156
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,310
Now that you picked a location and you can start to model out what the business actually looks like

157
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:08,180
I'm going to show you how we can build a financial model for a single location single product lemonade

158
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,050
stand.

159
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,910
It's just gonna be lemonade and nothing else.

160
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,120
And let's say that you aren't ready to go full time on this yet so you're only going to be doing this

161
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,880
on weekends since more people are going to be out on the streets on a Saturday anyway.

162
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,670
So what would two years of revenues look like.

163
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,830
Let's see how that would work out.

164
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:35,030
Okay we're gonna build a single location lemonade stand financial model right now and a few things as

165
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,630
we go through this.

166
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:44,060
I'm going to be going through this kind of quickly but you'll be able to reference a solution in this

167
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,770
lecture you can download to files the file that's empty like this when you open it and then the file

168
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:56,000
that has it all filled in and one of the things that can really help you learn is to then try this out

169
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,960
and then look at the solution look at the formulas that I use to actually do this.

170
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,760
Okay.

171
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,070
So let's get started right away.

172
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:11,110
We're going to do a two year projection of the revenues for this.

173
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,710
So we're going to look at 24 months.

174
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,890
Right.

175
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:20,680
So in the first row row one we got month and it goes from 1 to 3 all the way to row 24.

176
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,540
Okay.

177
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:30,050
Now a few assumptions that we're gonna keep here top of mind is our assumption about the price we're

178
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,800
gonna charge our cost per cup.

179
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,630
And the hours of operations per day that we operate.

180
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,810
Okay.

181
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,710
Sell it for two fifty.

182
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,890
We have a cost of eighty nine cents per cup and we're going to operate five hours a day.

183
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,180
All right.

184
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:50,830
Now we maybe are only going to sell this on Saturdays every month.

185
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:57,440
So maybe we assume that for every month we have four days we're actually selling and we don't expect

186
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,280
that to change.

187
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,290
So we want all the other months to equal to our assumption in the first month.

188
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,740
So we're just gonna say equal to the month next to it.

189
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,540
Okay.

190
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:16,430
Now if we copy this sell and then if we select the other cells command shift arrow for a mac users and

191
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:25,940
control shift arrow for PCI users then you select it and then you paste it and we see that there's the

192
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,480
formula for all of them there.

193
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,200
That's equal to the previous month.

194
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,440
If you select that each cell it's going to say equal to the previous.

195
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,670
Now let's assume we pick the location that has on average an hourly foot traffic of two hundred fifty

196
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,060
that walk by.

197
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,230
Okay.

198
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,470
And we stick with that same location.

199
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:44,720
Right.

200
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,890
So again we're doing the same thing here as we did for the day selling we equal to the previous month.

201
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:58,400
And then we can triple copy paste it to the other cells we have the formula.

202
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,290
What this does is if we change any of the assumptions for the first month it'll change it for all the

203
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,440
other months as well.

204
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:05,680
Right.

205
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,910
So if I change that or if I change this you'll see that it changes.

206
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,440
Okay we're going to put it back to four we'll put it back to 250.

207
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,690
So how do we calculate the average foot traffic per day then.

208
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,080
Right.

209
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:28,910
Well that's going to equal to are the number of hours that we operate in a day okay.

210
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,050
Which here actually it's going to be b 3.

211
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,100
Right.

212
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,770
So be three times the average foot traffic per hour.

213
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,970
So then that gives us the total foot traffic.

214
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,220
Right.

215
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,950
So total foot traffic of twelve fifty.

216
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,700
And because everything else the same we expect the other months to look exactly the same.

217
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,840
Now when I copy the formula over though.

218
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,230
There's nothing wrong here.

219
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,180
It's equal to zero.

220
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,810
Let's see what's going on.

221
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,790
If we put here it says it's two fifty times zero.

222
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,340
So the formula is not staying fix to this cell right.

223
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,290
This is what's called absolute reference that we need to make to this cell right here.

224
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,710
Okay.

225
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,570
So we're gonna change that formula.

226
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:23,410
We're gonna make it be three but a better way to do that is to fix it in the original formula we go

227
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,660
to the B three and what we do is instead of having it just look like that we're gonna put some dollar

228
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,360
signs in front of the row and column.

229
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:41,820
Labels so B and 3 there's now dollar signs for them which means don't change that reference.

230
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,530
It will always reference that cell no matter where it's copy too.

231
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,690
Okay so if we copy that now we see that the calculations are correct.

232
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:48,870
Right.

233
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:56,540
So we're going to just put it over to all of the cells so then how do we calculate the total foot traffic

234
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,410
per month then.

235
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,790
Well that's going to equal to the average foot traffic per day times the number of days we're operating

236
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,290
in that month which is five thousand.

237
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:14,750
So we expect all of the other ones to equal the same thing as well.

238
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,860
Let's look at our stop percentage.

239
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,470
Let's assume that the stop percentage for this location is gonna be 25 percent.

240
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,680
And we're gonna assume it's the same for each month on average.

241
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:27,940
All right.

242
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,520
So.

243
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,720
So again we're gonna do the similar thing there.

244
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,000
So then what's our total monthly stops at the stand.

245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,970
Well that's going to equal to the total foot traffic rank for the month times the stop percentage so

246
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,490
that's about twelve fifty now.

247
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,850
Notice the before we do the next one.

248
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,820
Notice that the logic here.

249
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,380
Right.

250
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,250
We're starting with foot traffic.

251
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,540
Then we're going to the stops.

252
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,510
And then of the stops then where you're going to think about purchases.

253
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,750
Right.

254
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,860
And then once we have purchases we're going to look at the cups per purchase or total cups sold because

255
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,470
well some people buy more than one.

256
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:23,600
So when we have cups sold then we can start looking at the revenue and the cost of the goods sold and

257
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,770
then we can look at profits.

258
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,900
So there's a top down kind of downward flow to the logic.

259
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,610
Okay.

260
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,380
So let's say 60 percent of the folks will buy once they stop.

261
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:37,460
All right.

262
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:43,670
So we're gonna make that same assumption that every month is the same.

263
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,120
So what's the purchase percentage.

264
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:54,350
Well then the purchase is going to be the total number of stops for the month times the actual purchase

265
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,160
percentage.

266
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,340
Right.

267
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,100
So now we have that many purchases in a given month.

268
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,710
And let's say it's one point two cups sold per purchase.

269
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,020
So we're gonna copy that and we're gonna paste that again.

270
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,460
All right.

271
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,560
Now how many cups sold are we going to have.

272
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,410
Well we have that many purchases per month times from one point two cups per purchase.

273
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,840
So that's how many cups we expect to sell.

274
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,530
So now we control copy that and paste the rest in the other cells.

275
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,050
So then what is monthly gross revenue.

276
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:40,890
Well monthly gross revenue is going to equal to the number of cups sold for the month times.

277
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,310
Well actually at times be 1.

278
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,330
Right.

279
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,320
The price per cup.

280
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,480
Now again we want the all the other references to reference this specific cell only.

281
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,850
And we don't want the formula to change for this be one reference because the price not going to change.

282
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,090
Right.

283
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,070
So we're gonna make this a absolute reference.

284
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,290
I don't like that but like best so that's the monthly gross revenue.

285
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,890
And now we can copy that formula and pace it to the other ones and you can do a sanity check here.

286
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,830
It should be the same.

287
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:20,320
So if it looks different than the formula is not copying correctly.

288
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,710
OK now how do we calculate the cost of goods sold.

289
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:32,860
Well it's going to be the number of cups sold during the month times the costs per cup which is be two

290
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,730
right there.

291
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:33,960
Right.

292
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,780
But again we want that to be an absolute reference here.

293
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:49,100
So we're gonna make it an absolute reference and then we're gonna copy this and we're gonna paste it

294
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,160
to the rest.

295
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,390
All right.

296
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,980
Now we can look at the profits.

297
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,200
The profit is going to be gross revenue minus the cost of goods.

298
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,420
So now we have the gross profits per month

299
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,230
so there you go in a few short minutes.

300
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,750
We have a financial model for this lemonade stand in a single location and we're able to look at the

301
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,700
profits the gross profits for a two month period.

302
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,310
So we want to look at something like what it's year.

303
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:29,860
Year 1 profits are what it's year to profits are all we've got to do is just add up the profits for

304
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,620
the first year and the second year.

305
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:31,840
Right.

306
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,000
So let's look at what that would be then.

307
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,070
The first year which there's a function called sum which is sums all the things that you put into it

308
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:45,120
we're going to say some and we're gonna select cells for the first month through the 12th month.

309
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,410
Okay.

310
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:53,830
So there's see that there's 12 columns selected and then we close the parentheses and we say equal.

311
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,930
That's the profit that is expected in the first year.

312
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,280
Right.

313
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:12,310
And if we do the same for the second year it's going to be from month 13 to month 24.

314
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,830
Now this is a simple one.

315
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,220
We're gonna be doing something more complicated later.

316
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:25,970
And I hope that gives you an idea of how to quickly build a simple model to evaluate your simple case

317
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,190
first.

318
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,880
Now take some time if you're new to excel if you've never done modeling this might seem a little weird

319
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,050
or a little difficult.

320
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:38,900
So what I suggest is start with a blank sheet and try to follow along with this video pause when you

321
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,600
need to and then look at the solution and really look at the formulas right.

322
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,660
Go in there and look at what it's referring to what is each cell actually referring to.

323
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,600
And make sure you understand logically how it's constructed.
