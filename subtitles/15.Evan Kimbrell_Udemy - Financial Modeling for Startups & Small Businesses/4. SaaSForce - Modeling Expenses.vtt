00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.580
Hey welcome back guys.

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.480
In the last lecture we went through the revenue modeling.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.720
So in this lecture we're going to look at the expenses now for the headcount that is not part of the

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.560
sales team.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.760
We can pretty much do what we've done before.

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.060
Right.

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.540
So we have a headcount and the conversation the per person overhead as well as these monthly overheads.

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.030
If that's the same everything should look very familiar to you.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.270
Right.

10
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.250
For those parts now the part that's different.

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.190
The part that I'm going to go over in this lecture for this case study is going to be the parts that

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.610
we did for when we did the single salesperson right.

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.160
The salaries the base salaries the performance salaries you know the additional sales overheads basically

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.560
everything related to the sales part of it.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.150
First thing though appear for the startup cost.

16
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.670
We are doing exactly the same way this is kind of all of the Before you launch before getting your first

17
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.170
clients and hiring your first sales team.

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.140
These were the spends here.

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.280
Now all of these assumptions here are actually just pulled from the first person.

20
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.560
The single sales person page here.

21
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.330
So whatever the assumptions you have for a single sales person it's going to apply to the expenses worksheet

22
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.420
and I put them here.

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.630
Even though it's over there just because it's easier to see and easier to reference here Pullan the

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.700
expense growth and salary growth assumptions This is pulled from the single sales person and I pull

25
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.190
that up to hear the sales growth and the expense growth.

26
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.440
Now the only difference here compared to the single sales person worksheet is that we can't started

27
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.200
in month one because we didn't hire the sales people until the 11th month right.

28
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.980
So we want to start the raises and then expenses for the overhead for the sales team.

29
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.620
When you start hiring because that's when we start counting we're raising it every year after that.

30
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.720
So the formula here basically factors that in it's kicks in when it actually starts right now set at

31
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.920
11 months.

32
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.960
But that's that's actually just really part of the sales team growth here.

33
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.310
You see the sell D 10 is starting in month 11 if we change that that formula over there on the expenses

34
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.110
side for this change.

35
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.060
Okay so that is there now the next part of it is we're going to structure the sales team expenses the

36
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.700
same way we did for the single sales person.

37
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.120
Right.

38
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.230
So here we did the revenues for first and then for the sale for the expenses we did.

39
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.250
Base salary and we did performance salary and then we did sales overhead and then we had the cost of

40
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.710
leads and then from there it was the total expenses.

41
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.720
So here we're going to do the same thing except now we kind of have to treat it like we did in the revenues

42
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.450
we have to look at the cohorts.

43
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.430
So first pull in the sales people count by cohort right.

44
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.360
That way we know how many sales people is within each cohort.

45
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.400
So then once we have the cohort we can start looking at the base value.

46
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.770
Now for the base salaries we don't need to do it by cohort because everybody is getting paid the same

47
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.280
base at that time right.

48
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.130
So theyre getting hired later theyre going to be hired at that base rate at that time.

49
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.990
So for the base salary is just going to be the total headcount times the base salary rate but for the

50
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.250
sales performance salaries that one's a little bit harder.

51
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.670
Now remember the form of salaries when we looked at a single sales person we had a performance draw

52
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.760
schedule right.

53
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.740
That was when they were ramping up and they also had a productivity curve.

54
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.280
Right.

55
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.900
So this is going to apply to each cohort from the month that they joined the team.

56
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.080
So when we do perform salary's then had to first have come up with the basic We remember the productivity

57
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.820
schedule.

58
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.170
So for each show we got to know where each of the months are right when the first month versus second

59
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.060
month is for each cohort once we have that then we put the schedule in there because we need to know

60
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.100
which month is the first month or the second month for each cohort.

61
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.760
But this was already calculated in the revenues sheet so we can just pull it from the revenue side right.

62
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.350
You see the formula I'm just pulling it from the revenue side.

63
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.700
Now once we have a schedule we have the performance salary draw.

64
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.480
Now remember for the salary drop in the first few months it's going to pull from that if the performance

65
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.550
is not passed right because the Zafir performance portion of their salary.

66
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.420
But the first few months they guarantee that amount after that it's completely based on performance.

67
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.870
So for each of the cohorts when they start we're going to choose the higher of the either the draw or

68
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.340
their performance their sales performance.

69
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.320
And then we use that to determine how much of their performance salary they're going to get.

70
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.760
Okay.

71
00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.130
So we choose between those two to select for each cohort case as the actual draw.

72
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.680
And then we sum that up and we have the total performance based salary portion of the salary for the

73
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.230
whole team.

74
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.300
So that goes them.

75
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.110
That's why this took longer to do.

76
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.920
Conceptually it's not really that difficult but it's a little bit you know kind of unwieldy with 60

77
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.410
cohorts to do but that's really the hard part.

78
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.430
Once we have that the additional sales overhead and other overhead is the same for each salesperson

79
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.790
right.

80
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.780
So there's no overhead schedule.

81
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:39.080
So we can do it the same way we treated the base salaries just the overhead rate per month times the

82
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.390
number of sales headcount.

83
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.780
The time is right here.

84
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.850
Now the cost of leads is going to be the net billing.

85
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.320
Okay the actual net billing for that month.

86
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.590
But the annual contract value for that month.

87
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.270
Right.

88
00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:02.280
We need to look at the annual contract value for that month divided by the average contract value.

89
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.210
Okay so if in that month there were you know say 100000 in annual contract value there and then we divide

90
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.500
it by the average contract value 50000.

91
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.420
That means there were two contracts that were converted so busy to customers and then we multiply by

92
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.940
the number of leads needed for each customer and then times the cost per lead.

93
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.250
That's how we get this total cost there.

94
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.600
Okay.

95
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.800
So then we have the cost of leads that kick in once we start having sales.

96
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.670
And finally we have the cost of sales because we have the margin assumption earlier right.

97
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.170
Gross margins of 80 percent.

98
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:48.530
So we take the gross costs out of the initial sales and then that would net it from the actual Billings

99
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.500
and the other stuff is the same as what we've done before.

100
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.410
So they're not that different.

101
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.120
I'm going to go over them again.

102
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.770
So there you have it.

103
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.790
That's the expense side of it.

104
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.140
The biggest part here is looking at this first portion.

105
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.720
Okay how did I do this portion.

106
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:11.330
The rest you've seen it before but this part handling it in a way that accounts for each of the cohorts.

107
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.060
Next up we're going to put them together and see what it looks like.
