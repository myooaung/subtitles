1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,090
You guys will come back to the course.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,840
OK so we're moving on in this mega model and we're going to start talking about the second and third

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,740
tabs.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,400
And my guess we get into the fourth So it's year one use of funds monthly income statement right here.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,050
And then just the regular income statement.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,750
So most of these numbers that are set up in this are coming from our assumptions and data sheet here.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,080
This is where most of these variables are.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,150
And if you click into these you can usually see it's usually you can see that it's still referenced

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,020
backwards.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,660
You'll see that it's looking at a specific sheet.

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,810
So this is taking it from right here like this is referring back to the CEO salary.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,780
I believe that was back in the original one and then of like here for instance you can see school acquisition

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,010
per sales that's pulling it from over here.

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,640
Yeah that's point from right here.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,960
Yes.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,050
So as we mess with this you would obviously see these things changing quite a bit.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:04,530
Okay.

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,170
So we did Year One use of funds.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,690
So the idea here was we were raising money right.

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,010
And we need to show what we're going to spend their money on.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,210
I mean that's a pretty standard one.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,600
You know if you aren't raising money generally you will want to make an expense sheet.

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,500
And I generally suggest making expenses each separate than your revenue.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,900
It's a lot easier to just say here's all the things that cost money.

25
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,750
Next she hears all the things that make money and then later kind of merge them together.

26
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:40,710
When you get into more of these standard things like an income statement why did we do an income statement.

27
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,000
Well in general corporations have three different types of essentially financial sheets to show you

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,360
have income statements balance sheets and then profit and loss.

29
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,710
Right.

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:00,030
So PNL income statements and then balance sheet balance sheets really focus more on the assets you own

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,450
monthly income is kind of just a way of looking at are you making money this month or losing it and

32
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,450
then profit and loss is more of a macro view.

33
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,330
How is going to look this year versus next year.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Really it's like a summary a profit and loss is probably the most kind of 10000 you can get with a company's

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,470
financial model.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,500
So we put an income statement.

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,700
And the reason why was because we were a startup and we dealing largely a start up investors are investors

38
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,970
just don't have time for those other ones.

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,880
I mean nice that you put a balance sheet or profit and loss but they just don't care.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,350
A lot of that stuff is just bureaucratic and it's helpful for a Fortune 500 company because they already

41
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,830
have six thousand employees for a startup you're just kind of wasting time.

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,130
So generally I just suggest go is an income statement.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,750
I mean it's easiest way of doing it.

44
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,400
The rest of it just doesn't particularly matter or it's not high priority.

45
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,910
So let's look at the year one use of funds.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,400
So we did year one because we assumed we would spend all of the money we made essentially in one year

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,030
generally speaking.

48
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,290
And this is an interesting old tidbit takeaway.

49
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,680
Nowadays the standard is when you are raising money.

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,240
Investors want to make sure that you're raising enough for at least 18 months.

51
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,650
18 months is a year and a half.

52
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,780
You can raise a little bit more at 24 but they're going to put you somewhere they want you to be in

53
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,670
that range.

54
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,280
A year is too short.

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,130
They just don't think that's realistic.

56
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,860
One thing to keep in mind is that fundraising takes a lot of time.

57
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,480
So you have to do that once a year.

58
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,710
That's crazy.

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,080
But then also if this money is in the last two three years then you should probably just raise less

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,550
money.

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:37,860
Right.

62
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,100
So why are we risking their extra capital if we can go 18 months with a quarter or giving year half

63
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,290
of what we're giving you.

64
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,410
So that's the general thinking behind it.

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,620
That's why we focus on year 1.

66
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,540
And you kind of see if you do look at this well we spend about two thirds of it.

67
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,750
So this is the most immediate way or most immediate use of the investor cash.

68
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,420
So what we did is we just split it up into sections that had payroll we had technology consulting marketing

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,220
and other SDN a as TNA is selling general and administrative.

70
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,500
It's just an accounting term.

71
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,770
A lot of this jargon you guys see you might think in going to business school how can I possibly figure

72
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,890
out all this jargon.

73
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,190
It doesn't really matter as long as you know accounting costs money legal costs money rent costs money.

74
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,240
You only have a couple things when your profit is you really should be fine.

75
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,180
Also if someone just looks it over for you they can often find these mistakes or you know you're going

76
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,610
to just Google accounting terms.

77
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,700
And I swear in 30 minutes you can figure out a lot of these terms.

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,820
You only have to learn at once what's gross profit gross profit is how much money you make on selling

79
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,120
something compared to how much it cost to make that that individual thing not including things like

80
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,760
overhead which are fixed expenses of nothing.

81
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,320
Are there regardless of how many things you make or sell you know those things you can learn very very

82
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,770
quickly.

83
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,280
So as DNA is kind of just like the miscellaneous been you know I guess you put it down here but regardless

84
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,840
there Miscellanies right here.

85
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,510
And really it's more buffer.

86
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,210
So this is like a contingency or things we just didn't know where to put you know like we said before

87
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,090
contingencies are always very important and that's why we put buffer.

88
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,450
We also know that we kind of baked in our contingency into the assumptions over here and a lot of places

89
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,510
we put these numbers higher or lower.

90
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,210
Just to give us extra padding.

91
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,290
All right so back to this.

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,250
So you can see over here is underneath payroll.

93
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:43,090
We actually then took those positions over here and we can collapse them into an easier way to look

94
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,330
at it.

95
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,940
So we said executive was these three you know technology and sales and so we just kind of collapsed

96
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,110
them down here.

97
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,420
So you can get a really quick look at what does the organization look like at the very beginning and

98
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,380
over time.

99
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,940
And then what we did over here is we put the percentage of the total.

100
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,270
Right.

101
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,070
So really this is just a calculation you add up all your payroll and then divide it by how much that

102
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,010
cost.

103
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,610
And the reason why we did this was because people do have opinions on how much you should be spending

104
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,410
for executives or how much you should be spending on sales or development.

105
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,270
Some investors want to see massive amount of spending on development because they think that's an asset

106
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,950
and a competitive advantage regardless of what you do.

107
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,250
And the other ones you know might be more sales oriented or think that you're spending too much on sales.

108
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,540
People have opinions about that.

109
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,550
So it's very easy to say look at this and go oh 20 years on an executive that is too much or too little.

110
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,170
Whatever.

111
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,970
So if I look at that and go exactly as you high I'll go back here and edit this out maybe and delete

112
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,230
them on fire myself.

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,010
Then you can see down here re-adjusted did the payroll total and taxes and benefits taxes and benefits.

114
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,210
As you can see right here percentage of the total up here it's about 3 percent.

115
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,230
But we got that taxes and benefits remember from the assumption sheet because we did we guessed it was

116
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,960
like 30 percent for a big 20 percent for benefits.

117
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,090
Change that and you'll change the numbers.

118
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,740
And then over here you can kind of see this is pretty static as it moves across.

119
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,420
But you see that we Franzen's are hiring data entry as we go.

120
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,900
And you'll notice actually I guess all look pretty static except for data entry and then we just add

121
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,560
Q1 Q2 Q3 to Q4 which I'll admit is a little bit corporate But again it's helpful to look at this.

122
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I go OK you spent you're going to spend $120000 in payroll your first three months basically you just

123
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,110
give them reference points to dispute it or just answer questions more quickly.

124
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,400
Sometimes they don't want to look into the details so it's a lot easier to look at these technology

125
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:49,750
and web hosting and software I don't know why are spending 20 grand on web hosting software and subscriptions

126
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,400
are just expensive especially when you start getting into these enterprise softwares where you know

127
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,400
you have to do a demo.

128
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,130
You sign a contract to use them.

129
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,830
I'm kind of surprised we put that as low as it was.

130
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,410
I figured we'd probably use more.

131
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,810
But while retrospection in total technologies you can see and then it just becomes well 2 percent of

132
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,080
everything added up together.

133
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,840
We could have done it.

134
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,530
So it's like what's the percentage of the technology group and these are the percentages of the payroll

135
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:16,980
group.

136
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,170
But I mean that's a little excessive.

137
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,450
I see them consulting.

138
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:26,290
OK well we kind of figured we would need consultants just because what we are trying to put together

139
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:32,220
had a lot of expertise in it and it's hard to find one CTO can cover all of that.

140
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,000
And we also wanted to work with contract developers at the very beginning to get it up and off the ground

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,180
so that's where we put this informational architecture.

142
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:46,480
Specifically it's called I say what it refers to is people who specialize in what text you should say

143
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,940
on your Web site in what area in what order.

144
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,720
So they're focused kind of on the structure of your web site for the maximum absorption for the student.

145
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,680
The problem was that with this application it's not immediately obvious how it works why it's a benefit

146
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,540
and how realistic a student should be with regards to how much money they're going to make in a scholarship.

147
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,700
So we were concerned that people would use it get confused and leave and that's why we thought it be

148
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,190
worthwhile to consult with someone to help kind of do user studies and put it together.

149
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,050
If I had to do it again I would obviously just do this myself.

150
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:26,290
But you know when you're raising 1.5 million it's not hard to slip in three grand for a consultant for

151
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:33,040
a month then pass that figure database security Well you're storing people's information for scholarships

152
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,500
you might get some of their personal information and that would be a nightmare if you lost some of that

153
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:38,820
data.

154
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:45,250
So it made sense to spend some on getting set up in something that's a little bit more secure than whatever

155
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,580
keeps getting hacked like Sony and Yahoo.

156
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,720
And basically everyone then marketing informational material 60 K for international Mercurials.

157
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,300
Well we kind of figured that we were going to do a direct mail campaign and that's just because the

158
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,410
people that we were working with universities and scholarships are basically in the technological stone

159
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,390
age you'll talk to them on the phone and they'll be like Oh okay great can you fax over your requirements

160
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,620
and I'll be honest I have only used a fax machine one time in my entire life.

161
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,870
I don't even know where I would get a fax machine so that was kind of our thinking there was wow maybe

162
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,210
direct mails the only way to do this is the way we can get our big a big blast of leads coming in to

163
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,480
get this kind of rolling.

164
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,140
And then you know as DNA then we just did accounting right we figured like 300 bucks a month is pretty

165
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,090
good for a part time accountant legal at the very beginning we assumed that there was the inflection

166
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:44,100
point where it has to be a lot of money mainly because this would probably be around incorporation giving

167
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,910
stock to employees setting up the investor structure and what we call a cap table is a lot at the very

168
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,750
beginning and then ongoing.

169
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,440
We assume that it only be about 3000 a month but there's still a lot and in reality probably what would

170
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,360
have happened is you probably spend 50 in a month and then nothing in the next six months or something

171
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,110
like that.

172
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,340
But it's OK to spread it out like no one's going to call you out on that because you can't see the future.

173
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,380
But you can guess you know 3000 a month on average is pretty good.

174
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,360
How do you get this number.

175
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,790
Well it's relatively easy.

176
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,790
We just had a lawyer we worked with and we also just kind of looked on some Web sites.

177
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:25,080
You know if you get to like law trades dot.com or Although Avey Oh you can see people's rates and just

178
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,310
look at their activities and figure just guess how many hours they rotate generally lawyers are very

179
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,420
fast they get a lot done in 10 hours so that's kind of we did that recruiting.

180
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,760
We originally I think we got this number from like we write it was from Job posts.

181
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,060
We had post job posts and before we knew how many people responded to a job post we know how much it

182
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,130
costs to put it up.

183
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,780
And then we also knew how much it would cost to like hire someone to go look for someone to hire.

184
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,100
And that's kind of how we bake that together and then travel remember came from the assumptions and

185
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,530
data where we said $500 per month per salesperson.

186
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,290
Well there's three salespeople and I think it was an extra 3000 or something you know office related

187
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,490
expenses of a year 10000.

188
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,530
Yeah it's a lot of staplers I know.

189
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,040
But you'd be surprised if you spend money on.

190
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,850
And let's see past that.

191
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,620
Then we had a big blast of money that we'd have to spend on getting the scholarships up and running.

192
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,290
OK let's look at the income statement.

193
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,600
OK so we know our costs for the first year or how we're getting set up.

194
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:26,760
So over here this is just our best guess at how our cash is going to look like how much are we going

195
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,310
to spend.

196
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,630
How much do you mean the bank where essentially are we going to be in a year and a half.

197
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,880
Or are we going to need to raise money again.

198
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,560
These are all things that investors want to know.

199
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,240
So kind of just set it up in a way that you could kind of follow along.

200
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,410
So here we assumed get eight schools added per month.

201
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:50,010
Now this is a little it's not entirely accurate because the sales cycle to get to school is probably

202
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,160
like four months.

203
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,530
And so our assumption was over the course of four months you could get on average a.

204
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,410
In reality we'd only get them over here and you'll see that this is this is actually why it changes

205
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,470
down here.

206
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
So anyway on average you're guessing or eating it eight schools per month.

207
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,850
And we got that by memor figuring out how many a salesperson could get and then multiplying it by how

208
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,680
many salespeople we had.

209
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,490
And then down here we were just using some quick numbers just for math.

210
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,870
That's not something you necessarily have to do and you can usually hide these kind of behind the scenes

211
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,460
numbers just to make it look a little bit better.

212
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,120
Get it down here even at market size.

213
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,920
Now market size we put because while we have eight schools on average based on the previous thing or

214
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,840
we said we had a mixed we're heavy on big or heavy on small schools.

215
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,700
Well how many students does that mean.

216
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,600
All right so how many are we actually talking about.

217
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,460
The reason why we did this is because if we left this out people would assume well hey you said your

218
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,610
market was 7 million students.

219
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,100
Why are your numbers so low at the very beginning.

220
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,320
Well because we've only actually message this many students early working with schools for this many

221
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,680
students.

222
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,750
That's why you put that there.

223
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,470
Then down here you have actual subscribers renewal subscriptions doesn't really come into play until

224
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,820
we get farther out.

225
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,160
Remember because it's a yearly subscription if we wanted to change yearly to monthly It would take a

226
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,040
pretty significant reworking of the model but it could be done down here revenue.

227
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,970
Obviously we have no revenue costs.

228
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,860
We're just pulling this from the assumption sheet college acquisition fee.

229
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,000
Remember we said it was like $5000 and we just multiply that by eight.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,660
Remember that's kind of a nebulous number.

231
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,370
We would've figured this out pretty quickly whether or not it's $5000 or there's any real cost associated

232
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,130
at all outside of the person's salary.

233
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,110
So I don't know.

234
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,170
Yeah we kind of did this separately than the salary.

235
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,820
Now down here we put contribution profit.

236
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,980
Now I don't know if you guys had this in school but I did not have contribution profit ever taught to

237
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,570
me.

238
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,720
I use gross profit or cost of goods sold contribution profit.

239
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:57,030
It's like a British thing or something but basically means all of the expenses associated with delivering

240
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,860
your product.

241
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,640
And then how much you can sell it.

242
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:08,190
So if we had eight schools and added message anyone or we sent $41000 on getting them then that's where

243
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,670
the whole 41000.

244
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,360
But over here we actually start getting into the area where they start messaging their students.

245
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,970
And then these are the penetration rate numbers.

246
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,550
Remember like 10 percent ish.

247
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:25,950
And then if they start paying then we're comparing it again to that 41000 that we just spent plus the

248
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,510
maintenance fees of our calculating before him and it was like two bucks per month per person and that's

249
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,430
how we get contribution profit.

250
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,760
The basic idea behind contribution profit is you just want to make sure that on an individual basis

251
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,850
like an individual product basis.

252
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,820
Are you profitable are you not conscious of a negative contribution profit that you seriously have something

253
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,300
wrong.

254
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,700
It's nice to very quickly see this and go ah you have a great amount of contribution profit this will

255
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,200
give you plenty of room to deal with contingency down area people.

256
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:59,310
This is all just pulled from before and you'll see over here that the salaries come in at the months

257
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,470
that we designated them being added.

258
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,220
That's why you see data entry kind of ramps up later marketing and media.

259
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,840
We pulled this again before and where it's direct mail campaign and printing of marketing materials

260
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,150
is quite expensive and the rest of it you can see here we just did red and black to get that point across

261
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:21,060
for you know we are not making money when we are making money then what we had was interest on income

262
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,540
interest on debt and tax.

263
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:22,820
OK.

264
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,260
Those are three things that are worth putting although not necessarily necessary you will impress them

265
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,560
on if you put them because it's like wow you actually thought about that.

266
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,820
Basically what this says is if you gave us one half million dollars we can't spend that all in the first

267
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,210
month.

268
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,500
So over the next six months it will set in a checking or a CD account or something.

269
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,720
So it's going to get some money generated from it.

270
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,490
The negligible especially if you spend the money slowly over time but that's not huge.

271
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,480
So that's what that is.

272
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,850
And then also with debt you pay interest on debt.

273
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,730
So if we end up spending more than we raise then we might end up paying interest on debt or if we just

274
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,430
took a loan on this and this wasn't for equity then we might be paying interest on debt like you took

275
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,870
a bank loan.

276
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,610
I don't know you may be going to say 7 percent a year rates you divide that out and it's like half a

277
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,280
percent per month or something and then you can see net income.

278
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,350
And then this is a great way of just showing where is our cash situation.

279
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,870
And as you can see it goes we just spend spend spend and then while they start messing their students

280
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,830
and then it gets a little bit better and then it starts going.

281
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,430
And then you know we hit another inflection point.

282
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,860
Next school comes on and it just kind of goes down and then up again.

283
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,870
Now the reason why it does that is you look at actual subscribers so this is just kind of a function

284
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,000
of email marketing.

285
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,680
If the school starts promoting your system and they send out an e-mail in the first month that's where

286
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,780
we see that penetration rate 36000.

287
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,190
But then the next one yeah you'll see people trickle in.

288
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,130
The market is not saturated yet.

289
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,400
So generally we just saw it like this like it kind of just habes all the way down until it's done and

290
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,010
that's how we kind of build up to I think the penetration rate that we were expecting.

291
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,970
Although this ends up I think making it a little bit higher.

292
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,620
But yeah that's something you should definitely take into consideration.

293
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,600
You don't make all of your sales right when you send an e-mail.

294
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,550
You do get those over time.

295
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,010
How do we get these numbers.

296
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,690
I think we just pulled these from some benchmark somewhere about email marketing and how many people

297
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,690
have signed up.

298
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,510
I think we also might have pulled it from the Miami-Dade test because we they e-mailed it out but then

299
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,010
we had people sign up at the very beginning but then over the next two months we still had people signing

300
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,580
up.

301
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,300
So we kind of use that as an as an indication.

302
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:41,150
But you can also tell by the symmetry of this you know slowly going down is largely guesswork.

303
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:48,090
And so that kind of explains why revenue spikes and then continues to go up.

304
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,340
And then here it kind of evens out with expenses goes down and then spikes again over here and you'll

305
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,380
see that when we get to the graphs and then the next step was the income statement.

306
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:04,200
Now this one was across three years which is pretty standard usually three to five is what you want

307
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,760
to do.

308
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:11,190
Certainly for fund raising anything past three or five years you're just projecting too much.

309
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,990
Even Fortune 500 companies have a really hard time projecting what's going to happen in five years.

310
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,110
So that's why I don't it's kind of a waste of time to go past that.

311
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,680
Last thing is just the income statement and really all this is is the monthly one condensed down into

312
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,370
something you can see very quickly.

313
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,380
Well you can see here is the first year you are going to make like $5 million off of this amount of

314
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,730
subscriptions.

315
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,770
This is our gross profit and or that's because it doesn't really cost us that much to put them on the

316
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,610
system.

317
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,210
So digital good essentially our gross profit is pretty much the same thing.

318
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,960
This is a cumulative schools member because we're adding them over time.

319
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,830
They don't disappear and we didn't have school churn which is probably something we could have put into

320
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,760
consideration.

321
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,440
But then you have down here the contribution profit how much we're spending on staffing on point two

322
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,390
of the five the thing on marketing now it's nothing right.

323
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,880
And then everything else I mean didn't we actually have tax sweet sweet tax 600 K spent on basically

324
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,280
nothing.

325
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,320
And then this is your net income now this is and you might have heard of sogers in the Q&amp;A.

326
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,740
Should you show off profit immediately in your financial model to try to fundraise.

327
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,440
I usually say yes but you don't need to show it in the first two three years.

328
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,900
People expect that you know you might be in the red for a while.

329
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,810
The only thing with this was we were pretty close to just making sales.

330
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,440
And it's a SAS System so we weren't trying to raise another round or trying to ramp up marketing in

331
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,240
the middle of this process or anything like that.

332
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:45,470
So we kind of figured that well we'd actually make some profit pretty quickly and then it would start

333
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,450
to kind of build what you can see here though is it goes up quite a bit and this is because as you bring

334
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,860
on account managers and sales people at first they're not you know it turns into account managers are

335
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,750
only going to be managing a certain amount of people and then they start filling up at a certain point

336
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,920
and then you start hiring more.

337
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,820
And is kind of a threshold problem.

338
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,330
And then let's see the net income you can tell over here you can see here that we predicted on ramping

339
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,830
up quite a bit in sales.

340
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:16,460
Also keep in mind that these numbers reflect that only 70 percent of the people who sign up and pay

341
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,650
here make it to this group rate.

342
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:27,460
So if we have a new set of 183 schools Wow this is created by a combination of leftovers here.

343
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:33,860
But then also average amount of students times the average penetration rate and that's kind of how we

344
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,210
get to this.

345
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,360
OK guys so in the next lecture we'll try to finish it out.

346
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,970
We'll look at the graphs and charts simple revenue and the two scenarios that should do it over.

347
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,240
You guys are enjoying this.

348
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,920
I apologize if this is less structured than what you're used to but I figured to be kind of interesting

349
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,640
for you guys to peer into a real model that was used to raise real money.

350
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,010
OK guys see the next lecture.
