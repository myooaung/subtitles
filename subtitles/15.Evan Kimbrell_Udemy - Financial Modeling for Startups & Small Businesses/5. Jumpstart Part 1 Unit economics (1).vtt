1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.160
And we are back.

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:02.670
OK.

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.260
So in this lecture let's dip our toes into the actual modeling part of a lemonade stand.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.320
Let's start at what you could consider the nucleus of the whole operation the product the actual cup

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.670
of limo nada.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.210
So now you can unsheathed your Excel sword.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.940
Say that 10 times fast.

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.720
Open up a brand new fresh sheet.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.960
All right.

10
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.840
So we're going to break this in by focusing on one singular goal.

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.870
We want to get the average cost of each ingredient in our cup and by doing that we can then get the

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.420
average cost of every cup we serve.

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.950
This really is the core metric of unit economics.

14
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.970
I sell something.

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.560
Well how much exactly did it cost me to make that said something typically healthy businesses can keep

16
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.630
this metric well below what they're able to sell the product for.

17
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.720
This isn't in contrast to say if you were a startup or Amazon where it's completely OK to sell something

18
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.860
for half of what it costs to make true story.

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.390
Amazon openly admits that's a sizable portion of their online inventory.

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.290
It's like 20 percent or something is actually sold at a complete loss.

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.390
And you thought you could buy dog food with free shipping for nine dollars if you're bored go to Amazon

22
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.340
even go find some of those.

23
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.620
I'll give you a hand.

24
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.970
It's pretty hard to offer free shipping on fridges and wait plates and still keep your prices at parity

25
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.920
with Wal-Mart or Target or something that's local.

26
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.190
But I digress.

27
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.990
So what you want to do is list off at the top of a column size.

28
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.870
This is where world will list out the reference amount or size of each ingredient.

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.790
Make another column for cost.

30
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.610
How much the unit amount from the first column cost doesn't matter what amount you are referencing as

31
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.510
long as the cost matches it.

32
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.390
In the next column will want to list out the cost per unit.

33
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.990
So what's the cost per pound or per sack or per sheet of the ingredient.

34
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.870
Or we can standardize it down to say something like cost per ounce.

35
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.380
Lastly one more column for that final metric that we're really interested in the cost per cup.

36
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.390
Now in the rows below these columns will list out each individual ingredient and its associated metrics.

37
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.630
Okay.

38
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.280
Great.

39
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.550
At this point what would you do.

40
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.820
Well you would do some basic research to figure out some core questions of your business things like

41
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.580
how many lemons does it take to make a cup of lemonade.

42
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.050
How much ice would you put in every single cup.

43
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.560
What's the ratio I need for water sugar and lemons to get this sweet and not tart flavor.

44
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.470
Well in the real world you would either know this already or if you were just building out projections

45
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.770
you would just do some basic research in this simulated universe wall instead just tell you for this

46
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.780
model we're going to assume you need a ratio of 1 to 1 to 1 for sugar water and lemon juice respectively.

47
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.830
If this were Georgia we would go 5 to 1 to 1.

48
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.420
But in the effort of simplicity we'll keep it where it is.

49
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.300
Feel free to write this off to the side as an assumption.

50
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.710
If you're following along at home let's declare next that we want to sell each cup of lemonade at the

51
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.340
Big Gulp size of 16 ounces and for every 16 ounce we want four ounces of ice.

52
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.490
So after a trip to your local CBS or again you're in Georgia Piggly Wiggly which actually is her retail

53
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.450
store by the way.

54
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.430
You then discover the following costs 1 a 10 pound bag of ice cost you four dollars sugar cost you about

55
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.430
250 for a five pound bag that some are two and three the best price you could find for lemons is about

56
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.500
15 cents a lemon water.

57
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.170
We're not going to buy at the store we'll just use tap water which of course isn't free.

58
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.410
But if you do the math your utility bill could probably deduce that five gallons or so of cost to something

59
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.870
like 25 cents.

60
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.970
It's almost negligible.

61
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.650
We'll just leave it out.

62
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.570
Now we can plug these into our columns and we are halfway there to get the next column.

63
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.580
We just do some simple division.

64
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.330
If a 10 pound bag of ice cost four dollars and there are 16 ounces in a pound then to get the cost per

65
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.440
unit we just divide four dollars by one hundred and sixty ounces which ends up being about 2.5 cents

66
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.280
for water.

67
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.770
Guess what I changed my mind we're actually going incorporated in.

68
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.260
But we know it's going to be cheap.

69
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.530
So there's one hundred twenty eight ounces in a gallon.

70
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.330
Why we don't use the metric system I don't know don't ask.

71
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.030
But with that five gallons that means we have six hundred and forty ounces of H2.

72
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.760
Oh now to get the cost per ounce we then just take that 25 cents and divide that by 640.

73
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:06.680
So for every ounce we get a cost of about zero point 0 0 0 4 cents.

74
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.490
Basically nothing with sugar.

75
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.020
We run the same math.

76
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.390
A pound is 16 ounces so five pounds is eighty ounces total.

77
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.080
The total cost for that 80 ounces was two dollars and fifty cents.

78
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.840
And then you get the cost per ounce.

79
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.830
We just divide two dollars and fifty cents by eighty ounces.

80
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.750
Magic number ends up about something like three cents.

81
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.220
Finally let's do the lemons.

82
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.220
If a lemon costs 15 cents and we know we need about four ounces of lemon juice for each drink.

83
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.130
Remember the ratio of a 12 ounce drink has to be 1 to 1 to 1.

84
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.930
So we know it's four ounces for each individual ingredient.

85
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.620
The question remains how much juice can you get out of a lemon.

86
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.150
It's not I go to this Google Interview Questions where you have to answer an impossible riddle just

87
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.460
so they can see you think i.e. watch you struggle with this.

88
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.080
There is actually an answer.

89
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.600
Let's say you know off the top of your head because you're a precocious 6 year old that you can get

90
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.740
a 1 point to 5 ounces per limit or better yet because you have that lemon squeezy contraption you can

91
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.680
get even more.

92
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.640
So let's say one point seventy five ounces per Lemon.

93
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.450
That means you can get a cup of lemonade.

94
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.450
Remember which requires four ounces with about two point three one lemons.

95
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.260
That's impressive.

96
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.180
So you make sure to write down two whole lemons and all caps on your sign.

97
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.760
Now if each lemon is 15 cents that means each ounce of juice cost you about eight cents.

98
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.860
Any other cost we can throw in there.

99
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.340
Well let's say we're not exactly phoning it in and we're in this for the long haul.

100
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.250
We really want to make our product top shape.

101
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.360
Something people might call artisanal or bespoke.

102
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.940
You decide to put in a little lemon circles to garnish each drink.

103
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.980
Let's say you can make eight garnishes per Lemon.

104
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.060
So that adds another one point eight eight cents to each cup you sell which means you can fill in the

105
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.780
last column and then work backwards by then dividing by twelve to get the per ounce costs since one

106
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.430
garnish per cup of 12 ounces.

107
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.760
By the way when we say garnish I mean literally taking a lemon and cutting it into six pieces not doing

108
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.850
a bitters which is just the wrapper of the shell of the women last thing.

109
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.630
Don't forget to add things like cups straws and napkins.

110
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:31.440
Let's say you can get bulk five hundred cups for seventy nine dollars at Costco let's say napkins are

111
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:39.060
25 blocks for 500 let's say straws or seven dollars for a pack of five hundred run the same division

112
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.520
and you'll get these costs respectively.

113
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.790
All right.

114
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.560
So all of that prep work to lead up to this very moment.

115
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.950
Take each number and the per ounce column and multiply them by four.

116
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.740
Display that number and the per cup column and Wardlaw.

117
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.450
We now know that each ingredient costs this much.

118
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:02.910
No surprise lemon juice is the most expensive thing in your cup with the dark horse number two expense

119
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.260
cups.

120
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:11.070
Now lastly if we want to add all of these up we get the final boss value of eighty one cents per cup

121
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.180
of lemonade.

122
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.690
This business is a money printing machine next lecture.

123
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:21.960
We're going to go a little farther and talk about the unit cost that you forgot about waste contingency

124
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.850
and good old fashioned labor.

125
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.330
See you then.
