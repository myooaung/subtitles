1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,800
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,420
This lecture we're going to do the revenue modeling for the smoke chili case study.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,290
Now for this one the big part of modeling the revenue for this is understanding this part what it's

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:22,470
saying is when we actually open the restaurant we're going to start at some sales rate and then we're

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,850
going to ramp up to some sort of a honeymoon sales rate.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,550
This is when everybody is super excited but eventually it's going to stabilize at some other rate.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,000
OK so we're going to start off and this is going to take this amount of time to ramp up to the really

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,360
high sales figure and then take some other amount of time and then it cools down or ramps back down

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,770
to a stabilized figure.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,630
Then after that sales are going to grow at this percentage rate per year.

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,460
So why why do it like that right.

12
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,540
Well that's kind of how a lot of restaurants actually operate.

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:06,140
You know if it's a restaurant that is expected to eventually do 1.7 million they're not going to start

14
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,310
there.

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,510
They can start as something much lower for grand opening and usually takes some time to ramp up for

16
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,940
them to drive awareness.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,950
And but you know for these kinds of new restaurants sometimes if they're doing well they also go through

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,960
a honeymoon period where they're doing sales that are going to be above and beyond what is sustainable.

19
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,910
Then they cool off and then they stabilize at some stabilized rate.

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,850
Okay.

21
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,090
So that's what that is.

22
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,690
Now in order to do that we've got to first decide when to actually start the sales.

23
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,490
So this part right here we've done this many times before right.

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,410
We're breaking down the startup period into different parts of the start.

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,580
So we have a build out period right now that from the start up worksheet where we're seeing it takes

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,770
six months this is where you're actually building out the restaurant putting all the fixtures in and

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,750
putting all the furniture and appliances in.

28
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:08,890
And then we accounted for a month of training and then to month grand opening period.

29
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,650
So that's when we want the sales to actually kick in.

30
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,690
The reason we still track the grand opening is because there was a grand opening marketing budget that

31
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,380
was going to be spent there right.

32
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,840
All right so then the next thing we're going to look at is the sales growth.

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,990
But we don't want to grow sales before Open's we only only start to count it after it opens right so

34
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,980
we'll see when it starts.

35
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,650
We know that grand opening right here is in month.

36
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:41,720
So there that's when it actually starts to start increasing at that 3 percent per year rate.

37
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,190
So then that's how you get 12 months you're looking at about 3 percent.

38
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,670
And then after that it continues to grow at that rate.

39
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,970
But this is not something where it's lock step right sales is something that kind of grows consistently

40
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,100
or continuously It's not something where oh a year later you're going to get this jump and then it stays

41
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,450
flat and then another year later you know there's not like rent.

42
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,920
So that's why it's continuous.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,770
It grows a little bit every month.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,980
Now in order to model out the actual topline sales for this we have to treat the timing of the ramp

45
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,740
up the ramp down in the stabilized differently.

46
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,830
We've got to track when it's actually happening right.

47
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:30,020
So the ramp up happens from grand opening in our case the eighth month.

48
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,640
And then we set the time which was what is it 12 months here.

49
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,230
So that's ramp up so whenever the grand opening happens it's going to go 12 months after that and then

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,440
the next 12 months we'll have the cool down.

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,890
And then after that it is stabilize what you'll see if we look at this part right here is well see the

52
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,730
this is the ramp up period.

53
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,420
Okay.

54
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,660
And then after that we'll see the ramp down period.

55
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,420
So basically happens after that.

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,980
And then after that we get the stabilize.

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,800
Okay.

58
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:19,870
The reason we do that is because we want to be able to do the calculations for the sales for each period

59
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,010
in time.

60
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,850
When our sales is zero before it's grand opening but once it is open we started at that starting rate

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,420
right.

62
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,740
What do we have at the starting rate.

63
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,100
We had it at six hundred thousand six hundred thousand sales a year.

64
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,760
Six hundred thousand in sales for the year.

65
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,920
That rate means for that month is going to be fifty thousand six hundred divided by 12 equals to 50000.

66
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,890
And then we're going to grow it to over a year 12 months to the 2.5 million mark.

67
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,160
Right.

68
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,140
So we can do a simple check right here which is have that times 12 see if we're growing it to the correct

69
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,220
figure.

70
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,080
So we are at that point it's at the peak honeymoon phase.

71
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:13,830
And then what we're doing is we're then ramping it down right so we're going to ramp down to the stabilize

72
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,890
figure.

73
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,170
Right.

74
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,300
So then we're going to ramp it down all the way to here.

75
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,010
And then after that is going to be growing at that the growth rate.

76
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,770
Okay.

77
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,760
So there you go we have that.

78
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,660
So then the sales gross sales would just be the sum of the sales coming from those three periods of

79
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:47,230
time see that we sum it up now we get this full sales right there.

80
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:53,410
Gross sales now for a lot of restaurants so you're going to have some promotions you're going to have

81
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:01,240
also some employee meals and you're going to comp some meals you know to maybe some customers who had

82
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,370
a bad experience or they got the wrong orders or you know there's going to be some things that you're

83
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,420
going to have to replace

84
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,750
that.

85
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,460
Well you will have to determine what that is what the right amount is.

86
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:21,190
But for a fast casual restaurant you're typically not looking at doing more than five percent of your

87
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,230
sales in terms of promotions.

88
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,940
And for employee meals that's really just the food costs because obviously you're you're not trying

89
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,590
to charge your employees for that but it is thought of as lost sales.

90
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,860
Right.

91
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:45,250
So we're going to make that adjustment and add all of these in here for these adjustments as a percentage

92
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,350
of the sales.

93
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:54,190
And then once we adjust for that we have net sales k.

94
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,190
So there you go we have sales and that was actually pretty quick to do.

95
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,790
Right.

96
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:05,330
Using some known benchmarks we can target what that value is.

97
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,960
Now if you think that hey there's no way I'm going to get close to that because I am not sure Poley

98
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:20,100
were smoke chili maybe we're going to do it you know to like one point twenty five million mark and

99
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,930
the peak honeymoon is just going to be you know this.

100
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,190
That's right.

101
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,600
You can leave it at what ever you want in that phase here.

102
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,690
And the model will adjust accordingly.

103
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,010
Okay.

104
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:39,900
So one of the good things to do when you have these projections by month is you may want to just do

105
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,300
a summary by year.

106
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:50,640
Okay so for here have years 1 through 5 and then use something called a sum if so have this year in

107
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:58,010
operations here that's calculating when the store actually opens then it starts counting the year.

108
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,260
Right.

109
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,660
So one can only look at once it starts to open and operating.

110
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:09,630
I want to look at all the figures so they have all the years 1 and going on forward.

111
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,000
And then what I have is then it's some's the appropriate role.

112
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,670
Only if this line here matches the year that it's from.

113
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,150
So when I do that it only some's the gross sales from year 1 and then from year to and then from year

114
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:37,330
3 and so forth we see that it starts off at some rate it grows it because due to a honeymoon you know

115
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,770
part of the honeymoon here.

116
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:44,350
Still it's doing better and then it starts slow down and then slowly wraps back up over time.

117
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:52,170
Okay do the same for taking the sales adjustments and then calculating the net sales as well.

118
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,810
Now in the next lecture we're going to look at the expense side of this.
