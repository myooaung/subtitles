00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.700
Hey guys welcome back to this course and this lecture we're going to talk about the free product but

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.910
pay for service business model.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.140
So think back to the early days of where they were handing out those square things is to every merchant

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.620
that they can think of or get their hands on.

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.070
But they were giving it out to them for free because while they want those merchants to actually use

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.850
it and when they use it they would be able to charge a percentage of those transactions in order to

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.770
make back.

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.920
So for a business model like this you have some development costs that you've got to go through first.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.700
You've got to pay for the product to get it out to these potential customers and then only some of them

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.870
will actually use it as a service that you can start charging a percentage of the transactions or charging

11
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.380
for.

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.940
So in this model we're going to look at something that is reminiscent of the early days of square or

13
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.440
with that business model looked like.

14
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.950
Let's take a look.

15
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.030
All right let's take a look at a quick sanity check for us.

16
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.980
So for a business model like this you're going to have to think about units that you're need to give

17
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.560
away for this free product.

18
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.910
Right.

19
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.860
You're going to give it away and it's going to cost you some money to manufacture or have it developed

20
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.890
and distributed.

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.300
It's going to cost you some money.

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.200
So for some pussy we're going to say if we give this many units away it's going to cost us this much

23
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.100
total.

24
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.540
OK so then are per cost to get a unit distributed in the hands of potential customers.

25
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.590
Is this much then of those that we distributed to some of them are going to actually use it.

26
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.050
So that's how many units that are going to be actually used.

27
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.090
And then of the ones that are use let's say this is for a pre payment processing device.

28
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.430
All right.

29
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.740
In the early years cost them that much to distributed.

30
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.840
And then of the ones that are being used this is how many transactions they use the process per year

31
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.420
per unit and the average transaction size is this much 18 bucks.

32
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.750
Right.

33
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.920
Then the service fee that's where they charge a percentage of the transaction total.

34
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.270
That's their service fee.

35
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.280
And in so we look at just this number here then.

36
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.890
So total number of transactions in a given year is the number of units with usage times the average

37
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.180
usage per unit for a year.

38
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.650
Right.

39
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.720
Then the transaction volume is going to be the transaction times the average transaction size.

40
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.730
So now that we have the total volume in the given year we have a transaction revenue from the fees which

41
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.970
will be the fee times the volume and then the revenue per unit with a usage.

42
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.160
So that's going to be the transaction revenue divided by the number of units.

43
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:01.920
So then the average revenue for each unit that's given out we develop the total units given out than

44
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.480
what we have that as well.

45
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.470
So this kind of gives you an idea of what your revenue numbers might look like.

46
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.410
You know if you have this kind of a business structure where you need to spend some money to create

47
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.940
and distribute it and get in the hands of people to use it.

48
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.060
But only some of them are going to use it enough for you to generate some revenue from those services.

49
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.620
Right.

50
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.230
Let's see what it looks like if we were to model this out.

51
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:35.160
So let's say we have this schedule where we want to try to give out 30000 units in the first year.

52
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.940
Okay but we're only able to efficiently give out 2500 units per month.

53
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.920
Okay.

54
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.890
So then we have this kind of schedule right.

55
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.500
Then the units in inventory at any given time.

56
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.070
First we're going to have just how many were coming in the order.

57
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.730
Right.

58
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.400
But then later in the following month is going to be what's in inventory minus what's been given out

59
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.160
plus anything that's coming in that month.

60
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.570
So then we have something that looks like this at any given time what our inventory looks like.

61
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.210
So it looks like we'll have 2500 left at the end of the year.

62
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.560
We'll you know be given out in that last month.

63
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.220
Okay.

64
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.920
Now we're going to be able to give out thirty thousand twenty five hundred per month.

65
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.930
Now the percentage these other assumptions are coming in from the front we're just going to keep them

66
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.530
as is.

67
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:37.600
So the active units that are added in any given month is going to be the percentage that uses it right

68
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.430
times the units that are given away that month.

69
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.310
So that's how many new units are added.

70
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.530
Okay that are activated that are being used and then the units in use in any given time which is the

71
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:56.100
cumulative one the first month is the same for the next month is the previous month plus the following

72
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.020
month.

73
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.390
So we kind of see what the cumulative number is now this column here I'm just doing some totals so that

74
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.330
we can see if we see that hey we added forty five hundred units total for the year.

75
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.780
And then here the cumulative number adds up to forty five hundred.

76
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.910
Then we know it's right.

77
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.770
All right then the average transactions per unit per month.

78
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.110
OK let's assume that each unit does 125 transactions per month.

79
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.430
So then the total transactions that are going to be processed is going to be the number of units in

80
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.500
use that month times the average number of transactions per unit.

81
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.950
Okay.

82
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.070
So that's going to be how many transactions are processed.

83
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.730
Now we need to make that a solid reference their absolute reference.

84
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:45.380
So then this these are the number of transactions process in any given month and the volume of the dollars

85
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.330
that's transacted is going to be the transactions times the average transaction volume.

86
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.060
And then if we have a 2 percent fee then the fee for any given month is pretty straightforward to calculate

87
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.720
as well right.

88
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.830
So we just have the fee times the transaction volume but we've got to fix the reference there and then

89
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.610
we have this total transaction volume.

90
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.370
So the cost of getting the units order and distributed now.

91
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:19.200
We didn't make any assumptions about what percentage of it the cost was you know the $15 was for the

92
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:26.460
order and in what was for the actual distribution for our purposes here let's just say everything's

93
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:35.360
paid for up front so we're going to just do that $15 times the units that were order.

94
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.120
Okay.

95
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.500
And because that's an expense we're going to make it negative and we'll do the same for the rest of

96
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.800
the year.

97
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.020
So then it gets paid when the order is.

98
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.750
So basically we're paying we're prepaying the ship the shipping or the distribution here.

99
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.240
But we just want it to delay when it gets to the customers based on the schedule here.

100
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.210
So then our actual cash balance is coming in right.

101
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.220
Is going to be the fees collected Plus the cash that needs to be spent.

102
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.990
So we see that you know we're going to be cash flow negative during the months when we have a big order

103
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.350
versus the months where we have some cash coming in.

104
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.220
And these are just going to be the cash balances in any of the given months right.

105
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:23.130
So we wanted to see something like Hey what's your maximum you know lowest cash flow rate.

106
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:28.440
And when do we actually get cash flow positive in terms of the account let's say like we're keeping

107
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.060
a cash account.

108
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.400
And then we can do this we can run the cumulative on that.

109
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.740
Right so initially we're going to be down that much.

110
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.870
But then the next month we're we're making some of that back.

111
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.290
Right.

112
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:48.630
And and so forth and what we can see is then we see that we kind of we get to the positive we get in

113
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:55.350
the black in month 6 and then after that we get to net positive here.

114
00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:01.730
So if I take some of all of the cash flows here as equal to this right here at the end right.

115
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.710
Cumulative.

116
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:09.390
So here we have a simple model of something where you give it away and then you rely on their use and

117
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.970
you're charging for some sort of a percentage of the use right now.

118
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.320
You can layer on any of the other pricing models for your product.

119
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:23.550
It doesn't have to be this payment thing where you're paying covering you know a percentage of the transaction

120
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.380
fees and that's where you're charging could be something where you give it away and then they have a

121
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.490
certain number of uses and then they pay you for the use.

122
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:31.930
Right.

123
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.110
So we've done that with the other models.

124
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.680
You can kind of mix and match things to make it fit your particular situation.
