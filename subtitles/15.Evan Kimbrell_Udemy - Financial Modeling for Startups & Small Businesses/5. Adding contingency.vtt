00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.940
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.730
One thing about entrepreneurs is you're very confident about your abilities and your business.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.100
And when you start to put together detailed financial forecasts like financial models it might give

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.570
you a false sense of control.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.810
Being able to accurately forecast something doesn't say anything about how you're actually going to

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.490
execute even the best executioners among us.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.570
No back-I the kind that executes according to a plan.

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.980
We're still going to miss some things.

9
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.460
There will always be something that is going to be outside of her control.

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.820
So when it comes to forecasting costs this is why you should always factor in some contingency or padding

11
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.470
or fluffy pillows whatever you want to call it.

12
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.800
It's about adding some margin for error.

13
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.130
Now you don't want to peg the success of your entire venture on you and your team having to hit the

14
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.030
bullseye on every single metric all the time.

15
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.920
It's always good to attempt that but you may want to give yourself a little bit of wiggle room for the

16
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.620
unexpected things that are sure to happen.

17
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.090
Server costs might be higher than expected your marketing costs might be higher than expected growth

18
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090
might be a little slower than expected.

19
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.290
So you want to have that margin for the minor bumps along the way that you're probably going to see.

20
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.570
So how do we model that out.

21
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.990
It's actually quite easy.

22
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.320
Okay let's start with some assumptions here.

23
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.150
Again let's say that you've already calculated the hosting costs.

24
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.430
Right now you're going to use a better method but for our purposes of illustrating contingency we're

25
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.500
going to use a simple posting cost calculation here.

26
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.530
Once we have that a simple way to add contingency is simply to add a pang of X percent.

27
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.230
So if we wanted to add a contingency of 10 percent then we'd just go 10 percent and then it's going

28
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.940
to be that 10 percent times the current calculated costs.

29
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.600
Right.

30
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.920
So then your revised hosting costs for user is going to be the cost that you calculated Plus the contingency

31
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.820
that is added onto it.

32
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.630
So that's the simple way.

33
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:26.220
Slightly more complicated but you know just as simple is to have contingency percentage that it is actually

34
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.270
changing over time.

35
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.360
Now why might you do something like this.

36
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.620
Well it may be that starting out you have more unknowns you have things that you just aren't as clear

37
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.160
about early on where you do need more of a contingency.

38
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.060
But over time maybe a year later after everything's kind of settled down you need less contingency you're

39
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.900
getting better with your forecasts your you know your costs a lot better so you don't need as much contingency.

40
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.140
Well if that's the case then we could do something like this where there's some starting contingency

41
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.480
value and ending contingency value.

42
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.320
And then how long it takes to get there.

43
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.690
Right.

44
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.740
So here what we did is we have the starting value which is just equal to that.

45
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:18.280
And then what we are doing is then we're going to take the max of which is this ending value right.

46
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.890
So we were going to keep reducing it from the starting value after that.

47
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.100
So we're going to start at hey it's equal to the previous And we're going to subtract the difference

48
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:39.350
here which is here is 5 minus 20 which is 15 percent divided by how long we want to space that out with

49
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.350
which is 12 months and then we're going to add that to the previous month so in that way that strips

50
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.710
tracks it incrementally over that number of months here.

51
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.360
Now the reason we take a max number here is because we want this to be the minimum.

52
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.000
So once we keep subtracting we don't want to go pass or be low this number.

53
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.360
So then that's why we take the max out of it because at some point if we keep subtracting is going to

54
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.160
get below 5 percent so when we take the max of whatever we calculated versus the minimum number that

55
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.070
we want to keep That's what this Max function does.

56
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.920
So it's kind of weird.

57
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.870
We want to make sure we want to ensure that this is the minimum then we're going to use the max.

58
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.270
We want to ensure some sort of a maximum then we use them in function.

59
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.450
So what we do we do that and when we copy and paste the formula across it calculates it out so that

60
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:32.400
by month 12 or 12 months later we have this stabilized flat rate of 5 percent.

61
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.670
So it doesn't keep going below that.

62
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:42.690
So then the contingency is going to be the contingency amount at that month times the hosting costs

63
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.640
of that month.

64
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.640
So as a percentage it's going to get lower and lower right.

65
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.900
But because the hosting cost is going up quite a bit the overall cost is still going to be increasing

66
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.230
quite a bit right.

67
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.500
We see that the overall continues is still going up but as a percentage it's getting smaller then your

68
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.390
final hosting cost the same you're hosting cost plus the contingency that you calculate.

69
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.320
So there you go.

70
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.480
There's two ways to do contingency.

71
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.090
Most of you this way is going to be good enough for some of you you may want to do it like this.
