00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.140
Hey guys.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.300
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.010
In the previous lecture we went from simple assumptions to building out a two year revenue model for

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.940
a lemonade stand.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.220
We built a robust model for results that change.

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.900
When we made changes to our core assumptions assumptions like these that were operating or the number

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.520
of hours per day of operation or the price point or our costs.

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.220
If demand is actually way higher than expected and we can raise the price to three dollars we can just

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.050
easily change the two fifty three dollars in our model and it would update right away.

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.300
All right let's fast forward now and say you did way better on your first day than expected and you

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.780
couldn't help but notice that a good portion of your customers were asking for a strawberry lemonade.

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.090
People who bought asked about it even people who came up to the table and left without buying.

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.830
Asked about it.

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.350
So you know that if you had the option you could do even better with your sales.

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.960
You want to added but you don't want to be preparing and transporting and storing two separate batches

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.040
of lemonade.

17
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.640
That's just way too much work and probably would lead to a lot more waste at the end of the day.

18
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:17.360
So you decide to make the premium strawberry just add on by using a syrup.

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.860
You'll be made of real strawberries that you'll add a tablespoon of to a regular cup of lemonade that

20
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.250
turns it into a tasty pink strawberry lemonade.

21
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.680
Now even though it's just one tablespoon of the Sierra per cup it will still cost you some additional

22
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.460
materials.

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.000
So let's update our cost economics first.

24
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.600
All right.

25
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.070
Let's get started with the model to add the strawberry premium scenario now.

26
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.330
All right.

27
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.020
So we first got to update the cost economics right.

28
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.530
We had this previously here for a regular cup but now we're adding a strawberry syrup for a premium.

29
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.040
So what would that look like.

30
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.820
So let's assume that this is a recipe for the strawberry syrup.

31
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.440
It costs half an ounce of strawberry syrup to make that lemonade a strawberry lemonade.

32
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.880
And it's made of 50 percent strawberries 25 percent water and 25 percent sugar.

33
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.180
OK so if that's the case then let's update our per cost economics here.

34
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.250
We have the bulk purchase economics here.

35
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:32.130
So let's cork calculate the cost per ounce where each of those things costs for the strawberries is

36
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.540
going to be of the four dollars divided by the one pound or 16 ounces.

37
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.800
Right.

38
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.750
So now we have the cost per ounce for the water it's going to be the costs for the five gallons divided

39
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.770
by five gallons divided by one hundred and twenty eight ounces per gallon for the sugar.

40
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.970
The sugar is going to be the 250 divided by five pounds divided by the 16 ounces per pound.

41
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.550
OK.

42
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.280
And so now we have the cost per ounce for all of them.

43
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.640
So now the way we're gonna look at the cost per use then is we have to look at that half ounce per use

44
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.020
of zero.

45
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.970
Right.

46
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.840
So the half ounce is we've got point five ounces times half of that that is strawberry.

47
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.130
Right.

48
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.240
And then times the cost per ounce but we think we're going to lose some of the strawberries.

49
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.340
You know there's some bad strawberries some that doesn't look ripe enough.

50
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.540
You don't want to use them might be moldy so you're gonna cost about a quarter of the strawberries out.

51
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.640
OK so we're gonna assume only a 75 percent yield which means we're gonna we're assuming that cost is

52
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.720
only applicable to 75 percent of the uses.

53
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.930
Right.

54
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:57.610
So then that is our cost per use for shrubs just under 10 cents for water.

55
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.050
It's gonna be our half an ounce of the 0 times the 25 percent that is water times the cost per ounce

56
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.240
and then for the sugar again is going to be the half ounce for the syrup ten point to five percent.

57
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.580
That is the sugar times the cost per ounce of sugar.

58
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.370
So we've got about nine cents of additional costs.

59
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.620
And now the total cost is somebody wanted to get it as a strawberry lemonade.

60
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.350
The total cost of goods is going to be just under a dollar and ninety eight cents.

61
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.550
So now that we have this let's do the model let's update the model.

62
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.780
Now the first part here the top part should look very familiar to you.

63
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.970
Right.

64
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.860
It's exactly the same as what we did before.

65
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.310
We still have the same traffic assumptions the same stop percentage and the purchase assumptions that

66
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.230
are being calculated.

67
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.310
We still have also the same assumption around the number of cups.

68
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.130
So it looks like the fancy strawberry add on will cost you just under 9 cents of additional food costs

69
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.570
but you feel pretty confident that charge 50 cents for it.

70
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.550
That's like 80 percent gross margins on this up sell.

71
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.960
Not bad but not everyone is going to add this to their order and only some of them will.

72
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.650
So how do we update the previous model to account for that.

73
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.360
Let's see.

74
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.960
So we're going to be doing all the formulas that are in gray here but before we do that we also need

75
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.600
some additional assumptions.

76
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.810
Right.

77
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.740
The previous one we just needed price per cup.

78
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.210
The cost per cup and the hours of operations we have the 250 for the price for the eighty nine cents

79
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.870
for the cost per cup in the five hours per day of operation.

80
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.870
But what we need to know in addition now in order to do this new scenario is well we got to know how

81
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.400
much we're charging for the strawberry premium.

82
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.830
So let's say we're going to charge 50 cents for the strawberry premium and then we're going to have

83
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.890
a cost of the nine cents that we just calculated for the additional costs.

84
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.210
But we also need to know hey what percentage of the people that make purchases or what percentage of

85
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.760
the cups that are purchased are actually going to be strawberry.

86
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.000
Right.

87
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.880
So more like percentage of cups strawberry and let's assume 30 percent.

88
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.710
So let's look at the calculation here now.

89
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.940
Okay.

90
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:31.550
That total monthly cups sold is going to equal to the total number of purchases times the average number

91
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.050
of cups per purchase.

92
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.580
Fair enough right.

93
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.950
Can Copy select pace.

94
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.080
And now we got the rest of them.

95
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.340
Now you could do sanity checks throughout your modeling just to see where you're at right.

96
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.090
So 1 sending the check we could do here is what what does that translate to in terms of cups sold for

97
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:57.080
our on average then that's the total number of cups per month divided by say the number of days that

98
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:06.250
we are selling divided by the number of hours sold that are operating per day.

99
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.820
Now again for that one we've got to make an absolute reference if we're going to carry that formula

100
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.860
over to the other cells since there's only one cell referencing the hours of operation.

101
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.760
So you're with the sandwich check we're looking at forty five cups sold for our you know if it's a very

102
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.150
busy location maybe it may be a little aggressive we don't know but at least you have an idea of where

103
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.910
that is right.

104
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:37.280
Because if instead this number is like you know 500 cups sold for our then you know you did something

105
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.020
wrong up here in terms of your assumptions or the calculations.

106
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.200
All right.

107
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.270
So a monthly premium capsule.

108
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:54.470
Well the total monthly premium of sold is going to be the total number of cups sold times the cell B

109
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.460
7 which is the percentage that actually are shrubbery cups.

110
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.070
So right.

111
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.900
The premium cups so we're gonna make that an absolute reference and we're going to calculate that.

112
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.450
So that is the number of premium cups that are sold.

113
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.320
So then that means the regular cups sold is just going to be the total number of cups minus the premium

114
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.570
cups.

115
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.450
So how do you calculate now the revenue from the cups.

116
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.560
Right let's do the regular on first regular 1 is pretty easy right.

117
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:33.700
It's going to be just the regular cups old times the price of a regular cup which is be 1.

118
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:41.370
Right so that's the revenue but what's the revenue for the premium cups.

119
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:41.960
Okay.

120
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:51.590
So we're gonna say the number of premium cups times the price of a regular cup because we get to buy

121
00:08:51.590 --> 00:09:00.700
that first plus the price of the add on right.

122
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.480
So it's then that times the number of premium offers.

123
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.600
That's the revenue from the premium cups.

124
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.950
And what's the total revenue then.

125
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.900
Well it's going to be the sum of the two right.

126
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:21.680
These two plus each other and with monthly cogs we're gonna do it very similarly right.

127
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:30.330
So regular COGS is going to be the regular number of a number of regular cups times the cost of goods

128
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.310
for a regular cup which is eighty nine cents.

129
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.720
Fair enough.

130
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:42.300
Now the premium one is gonna be the number of premium cups times

131
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.250
the cost of a regular cup.

132
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:48.940
Right.

133
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:54.970
Plus the costs of the syrup.

134
00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:03.160
That's the total cost of goods for the premium cups so then the total cost of goods will be the sum

135
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.780
of the two now what's the profits.

136
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.850
Well the profits going to be pretty straightforward right.

137
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.010
It's going to be that the total gross revenue minus the total COGS.

138
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:23.920
So we have to see how I did all of this vertically first because I know the other months have the same

139
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.750
calculations.

140
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.160
If it is then we can select the whole group.

141
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:34.600
Copy and select this whole section for all the months and then we paste it.

142
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.040
Now when we copy this notice that's not looking right.

143
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.470
It should look the same because all our monthly assumptions are the same.

144
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.580
Why doesn't it look the same.

145
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:52.500
Well one common mistake that is made when modeling sometimes you forget to do something upfront right.

146
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:58.940
You see here we forgot to put the cups calculations for all the other months.

147
00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.140
Right.

148
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:07.270
So if we do this now and put it where it's supposed to be everything flows and we have something that

149
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.370
looks right now.

150
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:14.290
So one other thing that can make your life a little bit easier when you're modeling and let's just do

151
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:21.620
one of the examples here which is let's look at the revenues.

152
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.760
Right.

153
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:30.610
When we look at a formula like this you know I select the cell it has to follow a long ranking to say

154
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.420
oh what does this cell refer to this refers to premium cups sold.

155
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:40.110
And then this refers to price for Cup for the regular cup.

156
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.720
And then this refers to the price of the premium add on.

157
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.500
OK I get that.

158
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:52.060
But is there a way where we can do the same thing but make it a little bit easier to read when you look

159
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.840
at it later.

160
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.320
Well here's one way.

161
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.020
This is called naming it is cells or name ranges.

162
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.640
When I select this notice that I can put a name for this here on this.

163
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:09.100
This little white space here just above the top left corner of the spreadsheet.

164
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.740
When I select the cell you can type in the names I put price regular cup.

165
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:24.130
OK and then I'm going to go to the second one and call it strawberry premium OK you can name it what

166
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.100
you want but make sure it's very clear that you understand what what you're naming it.

167
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.320
Right.

168
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.310
So then let's do this again.

169
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:37.250
OK and you can also do it for an entire range not just a single cell.

170
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.500
Right.

171
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:47.320
So if I if I select this whole range here this is going to be total monthly cups sold OK.

172
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.760
So now that I have those name let's let's see how we can redo the revenues formulas.

173
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.150
OK.

174
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.540
So I'm I'm going to do this one first.

175
00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:05.790
We're gonna clear that out I'm going to say this one is going to be total monthly cups sold.

176
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.000
You see that when you when you type that in whatever you name will show up.

177
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And if you tabard whoops You can selected.

178
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:16.310
Right.

179
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.200
Total monthly cups sold.

180
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.040
Times the price

181
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:37.380
regular cup so now it's using the names that I use instead of the formulas.

182
00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.120
But that's not right and I don't want the total cups.

183
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.770
I want the regular cups right.

184
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.750
So I'm gonna have to find my other one which I named it.

185
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:53.170
I think I named it monthly regular cups so there we go.

186
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.650
See that once you have the correct name it it finds it for you.

187
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.630
So now I have the correct calculation and it looks the same as the other ones.

188
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.880
We'll compare the formulas.

189
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.560
They look very different right.

190
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.110
I copy this code across.

191
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:12.860
So now if I come back to this some days later I remember what I was doing.

192
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:19.980
But if I select the cell and I look at my formula says oh this is equal to the monthly regular cups

193
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.920
sold times the price of a regular cup okay.

194
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.380
Got it.

195
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.600
It's going to be a little bit easier now.

196
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:34.680
It takes a little practice to name it and use it in ways that are easier for you to follow.

197
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:40.090
But this is one that is worth practicing and using in your models because after a while if you have

198
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.760
a lot of formulas it gets a little confusing.

199
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.910
Now I'm teaching it in terms of the formulas because that's a faster way to do this and to show you

200
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:54.580
rather than name each thing each time and I have to explain all the naming in addition to the modeling.

201
00:14:54.970 --> 00:15:04.270
So in our examples I'm not going to name the formulas but I encourage you to practice naming your variables

202
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.190
when you use them.

203
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.520
So it's easier for you to reference well done.

204
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:15.360
You now have a financial model for your lemonade business that handles a main product and an up sell.

205
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:21.820
Up next you're feeling really confident and you decide to expand and open multiple locations.

206
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:27.570
How do we model things if you want to grow to five locations by the end of the first year.

207
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.700
I'll see you in the next lecture.
