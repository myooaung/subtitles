00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.230
Hey guys.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.640
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.700
We talked a lot about modeling in the previous two sections or some best practices without actually

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.170
doing a whole lot of modeling.

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.410
So we're going to do some of this before we talk about some other things again.

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.430
Now in this section we're going to model out a concept called you works.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.150
It's a CO office coworking space for entrepreneurs and freelancers to work together under the same roof.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.710
There are conference rooms there are shared desks private this private offices and other common areas.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.830
Folks can get memberships ranging from their floating desk memberships to dedicated desks to private

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.250
offices each costing more per month.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.660
So with these options we kind of have a natural segmentation of the customers because no customer is

12
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.430
going to be in two plans.

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.890
So how might we model something like this in the spreadsheets.

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.960
Let's start with the basics first with a sanity check.

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.570
All right.

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.260
The first thing that we're going to do is do a sanity check again.

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.550
Right.

18
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.190
So with you work's kind of business model you've got to start off with the space that you're looking

19
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.710
at right or the size of the space that you're thinking about.

20
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.770
So we're going to start with that and let's say we wanted to look at a 50 thousand square foot office

21
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.870
it's like an old office building could have been an old factory building that's now in an up and coming

22
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.110
you know hipster office area and you works is seeing a opportunity there now something like this you

23
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.990
don't need to know where these numbers come from.

24
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.590
But in terms of looking at these kind of real estate heavy types of projects they're going to be looking

25
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.580
at the cost of acquiring say the building the old building itself.

26
00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.110
OK and maybe they might be spending a hundred dollars per square foot on just the existing building

27
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.350
or whatever is there.

28
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.960
It's in the nice prime location so it costs a little more than buying just some plain rundown warehouse

29
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:19.470
that nobody wants and then they might be spending a good amount on the build out to make it really nice

30
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.080
to make it an upscale office feel and to add all those amenities and features that will attract the

31
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.450
kind of customers that they want.

32
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.630
So maybe they're going to spend three hundred and twenty five bucks on a per square foot on the buildout.

33
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.890
All right.

34
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.030
So we've if we have that kind of assumption then the cost of the building to get it to the point where

35
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.310
it's ready to take on customers to buy it and make all the renovations and the buildout is going to

36
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.410
equal to 50 thousand times the four hundred and twenty five dollars per square foot.

37
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.020
Right.

38
00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.480
So why do we have this number here this kind of gives us an estimated costs of building by itself.

39
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.240
Now this does include all of the other costs related to starting this up.

40
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.520
Right.

41
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.040
There might be some design work permitting marketing.

42
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.330
Right.

43
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.940
All of those other things is just for the building itself.

44
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.390
Now we're we're just going to keep that there so we can refer back to that.

45
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.570
OK.

46
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.750
Now in terms of doing a sanity check.

47
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.750
Well let's think about the spaces right.

48
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.240
What are the spaces that are there for something like a shared coworking space.

49
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.130
Well we're going to have common spaces right.

50
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.350
We're gonna have share desks.

51
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.790
These communal desks where you know you can sit anywhere you want as long as you have that membership.

52
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.750
But then there is also private desks.

53
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.950
Some people want to have a dedicated private desk that they're going to have whenever they go there.

54
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.120
All right.

55
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.820
And then there are groups or some individuals that want to have a private office and maybe we'll have

56
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.610
a small office for small groups and some large office.

57
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.950
OK.

58
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.410
Now all of the space is going to be divided up between these sets of categories of spaces.

59
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.630
Right.

60
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.630
So one way we can think about dividing the space up is this split.

61
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.100
All of them by a percentage.

62
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.390
OK.

63
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.710
So maybe from practice they know that you need to have at least you know 35 percent set aside for common

64
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.070
spaces conference rooms and Hall halls and reception area is maybe a kitchen and bath.

65
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.930
You know things like that 15 percent for shared desks maybe another 15 percent for private desks 20

66
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.760
percent for small office.

67
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:52.680
And then what we can do is we can have the rest which what we can do is by saying one minus the rest

68
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.850
of the percentages.

69
00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.960
Now the reason we do that and they get not a plug in assumption is that way we can enforce that.

70
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.600
All of this is 100 percent.

71
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.230
So you just put in the assumptions for these first phase as well the last space has to take up the rest.

72
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:17.260
Right now we can kind of get a idea of the spread now by multiplying these percentages times the total

73
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:24.390
square footage right in because it's a cell here that we want to reference all the way down.

74
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.130
We want to make that a absolute reference.

75
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.370
OK.

76
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.070
So based on those assumptions we can get this kind of breakdown in terms of the amount of space that

77
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.390
is available for the different types of uses.

78
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.370
OK then we've got to think about well OK we have the square footage for these spaces and you know we

79
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.560
can change them around.

80
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.590
But how many seats do we actually have.

81
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.670
Right or spots that the business can sell or or rent to.

82
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.160
OK.

83
00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:01.340
So we can think about how much space is needed or is given or allocated to say a shared desk maybe a

84
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.360
share does doesn't really take that much space.

85
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.940
Maybe it's just kind of like a five by five area a little box is good enough.

86
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.730
And so we allocate twenty six square feet for shared desk but for private desks we give a little bit

87
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:23.410
more space so maybe it's on average thirty six square feet and small offices maybe we provide you know

88
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.450
one hundred twenty square feet and then for larger offices two hundred fifty square feet.

89
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.080
Okay.

90
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.530
So much bigger than the other spots but you know still reasonable.

91
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.270
So if we have those assumptions for the sizes now how many spots do we have.

92
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:45.220
Well the spots available will just equal to the square footage that we have divided by the square footage

93
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.460
per spot.

94
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.630
Right.

95
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.650
So then now we get the number of spots.

96
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.560
So when we do that we can do this calculation and we copy this formula piece it down.

97
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.990
Now I didn't have to use absolute references here because well we wanted the formula to track right.

98
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.940
Each time we wanted to track to a different number there.

99
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.280
OK.

100
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.440
Well actually do you if you notice I did that with the wrong square footage here.

101
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.630
Right.

102
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.390
So I needed to adjust this.

103
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.030
Move it down and reconfigure the formula.

104
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.240
So now.

105
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.410
OK.

106
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.230
Large office.

107
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.750
Correct.

108
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:22.510
See this is why you got to do spot checks and make sure you are actually calling the right place for

109
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.200
your formulas.

110
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.820
OK so now we have the number of spots here.

111
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.830
Then we can think about how much we might want to charge for each of these spots.

112
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:31.260
Right.

113
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.990
And we're gonna think about a price per month.

114
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.780
We're going to model this out on a per month basis.

115
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.040
Then this will be useful for us.

116
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.110
So for share desks maybe let's start off with two hundred fifty dollars per month.

117
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.260
OK.

118
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:51.550
And then for the private desks dedicated desk is 350 for the small office is 550.

119
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.980
And for the large office is for groups is going to be fifteen hundred maybe a little bit more.

120
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.580
You know that's a really big space.

121
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.330
So maybe it's sixteen hundred whatever that is.

122
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.660
OK so then let's calculate a maximum possible gross revenue.

123
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.240
Right.

124
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:13.820
That's based on just the number of seats there are spots available for each of the categories.

125
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.300
So then we could do the same calculation that we did before.

126
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.420
So we can get a a monthly gross.

127
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.100
OK.

128
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.660
So we see how that sort of is distributed.

129
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:28.090
We see that even though we charge a lot more for these small offices are the private offices it makes

130
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.170
up a lower percentage because it has fewer spots available.

131
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:40.210
So there was some that up we'll get an idea of the maximum gross rent that this business or with this

132
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.140
size can generate.

133
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.580
OK.

134
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.750
And if we annualize that we could see what that looks like on an annual basis.

135
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:45.970
Right.

136
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.420
Just multiply it by twelve.

137
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:57.190
As a quick estimate now from here we can do some estimates about how much the size of the project this

138
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.470
can support.

139
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:06.060
So basically how big of a budget could a project like this with this kind of income support.

140
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.590
OK so maybe we could do something like.

141
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.480
All right well let's say we all.

142
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.670
We most want to put you know 35 percent of gross rents towards debt service.

143
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.030
Okay.

144
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.030
And then from that we can sort of calculate what a maximum loan is right.

145
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:28.570
That you know assuming let's say we're putting in five point five percent a year in terms of debt service.

146
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:28.940
OK.

147
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:35.290
So what that means is if the debt service if thirty five percent of the income is going to debt service

148
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:41.200
and it is paying 5.5 percent of the total debt every year you know whether it's advertising that we're

149
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.740
just assuming that for now then we can 5.

150
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:51.120
We can do it like this and calculate what is a maximum loan that we could support based on this assumption.

151
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.340
All right.

152
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:59.140
So the max loan here can be supported is this and then for most projects like this loan there is a certain

153
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.660
loan to value right they'll fund a certain loan to value in terms of the project's size.

154
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:10.310
Okay so maybe we'll say this is 60 percent loan to value then what is the total project size.

155
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.720
Well then it will be that divided by point six.

156
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.030
And now we have a total project size about 30 million.

157
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:27.820
Of course if that's in the loan then what we would need in terms of the equity from investors will be

158
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.340
the total project size minus the loan.

159
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.480
So you guys now kind of get an idea.

160
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:41.170
All right well to do a project like this you need to raise twelve point three million for a 30 million

161
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:46.570
dollar project maybe 20 million is going to the building itself and the rest is towards all of the other

162
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.560
things that need to be done in order to get this up and running.

163
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.160
We could also kind of estimate.

164
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.430
All right well if this were kind of role then to covering the business what what is it in terms of per

165
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.090
square foot.

166
00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.410
Right.

167
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.420
In terms of the total project it's more like six hundred.

168
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:07.090
So there is a little cushion because you know costs of buying and building out is about four hundred

169
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.810
twenty five dollars then we definitely want to have some cushion.

170
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.610
So this makes it seem like it's possible if we're confident about these kinds of numbers.

171
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:16.160
OK.

172
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.480
So here's a quick sanity check then.

173
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:24.370
Now when we think about this though what might be some things that you might want to pay attention to

174
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.320
to account for in your model and your revenue model.

175
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.550
Right.

176
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:35.080
For shared desks especially something to think about is well you have a certain number of shared desks

177
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:44.140
but each person isn't going to show up every single day in every single hour that it's open out of that

178
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.790
month.

179
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.230
Right.

180
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.840
The utilization is not going to be 100 percent for every person that you sell the seats to.

181
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.880
That means you're probably going to be able to oversubscribed.

182
00:11:53.890 --> 00:12:03.340
Now if if for example if the average utilization is 10 days out of the month cases like 33 percent theoretically

183
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.320
then you could oversubscribed by 3 X you know if you've got 30 days in a month.

184
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:14.080
But to be conservative where we may not want to go all the way to 300 percent we may just oversubscribed

185
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.010
by a certain amount.

186
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:15.550
Okay.

187
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.850
Somewhere in between that.

188
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:27.540
So there's a note here is he oversubscribed to get higher utilization and rents.

189
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:27.890
Okay.

190
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.960
Now for everything else because they're going to be dedicated and private.

191
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.700
You can't actually double lease them.

192
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:33.910
Right.

193
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:42.820
So we're going to say for everything else maybe there is some sort of time required to lease up.

194
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.320
Why.

195
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.760
Because well you know you're opening with all this available space and all these spots you're not going

196
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.770
to be 100 percent sold on day one.

197
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:58.180
I mean that would be ideal but most businesses are gonna take some time to actually lease up.

198
00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.190
Once you open.

199
00:12:59.200 --> 00:12:59.740
Right.

200
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:06.190
Just like any kind of real estate any kind of business is similar to this where it's about capacity

201
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.820
it's gonna take a little bit of time to fill it up and reach full capacity.

202
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:16.120
So just from this from this sanity check and just a little thought about it this gives us an idea of

203
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.370
how to Moller out the revenue.

204
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.370
Now we're gonna take a look of that in the next lecture.
