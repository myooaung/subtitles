1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,770
OK we are back.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,130
All right let's look back at our user X model and apply the new concept.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,750
We are now masters of customer segmentation.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,850
OK let's refresh your works.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:18,660
Is our version of We work and we're planning to run our office space on both strict and flexible terms

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,350
to all sorts of small businesses and freelancers.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,920
We rent big space we convert it to something you know with like the water tanks with the cucumbers in

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,810
it and then we make sure that we have at least eight different types of African coffee.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,850
The idea here with this business is that in order to capture the largest group of paying members we're

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,000
going to offer different types of spaces.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,120
So Miguel what you call a hot desk or I think in the Excel we call it a shared desk and some will basically

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,950
want a cheap semipermanent office for their company.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,560
OK on your own Think this through how would you segment your customers slash users.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,680
Well first off let's answer a quick question.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,870
Do we have both users and customers.

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,400
Well it's possible that we offer something like 30 day free trial and for that first month they're considered

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,880
users for our sake and what I think is actually more of the norm and this co-working space is that we're

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,910
not going to have a free trial or at least a lengthy one.

19
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,360
We can just pretend that everyone that walks in the door pays some kind of dough.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,860
So how in this scenario would we segment it.

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,510
Well Pat yourself on the back and if you didn't just blurt something out like income bracket or the

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,000
brand of the car that the customer drives we have to figure out what questions we're trying to answer.

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,130
And we don't really care what car they drive.

24
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,970
Well since this isn't a real scenario we can just hypothesize.

25
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,390
Since we're talking about projections for a proposed business right now we can assume our goals with

26
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,800
our model are probably a little bit different than if we were already in the thick of things trying

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
to figure out what's going on.

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,660
Let's go through three possible scenarios to give you some context to play around with let's say in

29
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,040
order to start this business.

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,390
We wanted to get a loan from a bank.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,310
Is this something a bank would finance.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,950
Yes actually it probably is something and you probably wouldn't have that hard of a time.

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,340
Banks care about having assets they can seize in case you missed your bills.

34
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,470
That's probably their biggest sticking point.

35
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,590
When you ask for money from them but past that what's a bank probably going to care about the most member

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,190
banks just give you money and you pay them back a percentage of the amount you loaned them over time.

37
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,770
They don't care if you grow into a billion dollar company or a million dollar company.

38
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,770
What they do care about though is when you're going to break even.

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,620
Because that's when you can start paying them back in earnest.

40
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,270
So if I was trying to figure that out trying to break even what might I segment my customers by what

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,740
segmentation gets me closer to figuring out that answer.

42
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:10,380
Now remember coworking spaces are basically miniature leases and like any monthly plan you can pay monthly

43
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,340
or you can pay up front.

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,880
Well I would guess that a lot of customers will want to pay each month and a lot of them will want to

45
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,540
pay per year specially if there is a discount.

46
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:31,080
So if we segment by that we can then see what the proportion of the two is and how if we focus towards

47
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,800
one versus the other which one could potentially get us to break even faster we can do that because

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,530
we isolate the two.

49
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,720
Now the best thing about annual buyers is they give you a wad of cash up front.

50
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,850
So we're probably going to be focusing on the upfront buyers that gets us there a lot faster.

51
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,430
Really helpful to segment them that way if you're trying to figure that out.

52
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,180
OK now scenario number two right we're not doing the bank loan thing anymore.

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,720
Let's imagine now we're instead talking to venture capital and trying to raise a million dollars to

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,480
get this thing started.

55
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,630
VC on the other hand is not a loan.

56
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,620
It's equity.

57
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,420
They basically own a percentage of your company for probably more or the same amount of money you'd

58
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,740
get from a bank.

59
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,220
Now what's a VC going to care about.

60
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,010
Are they gonna care about assets.

61
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,180
No not really.

62
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,720
Actually they rarely care about assets VCs if you're not aware are really the way they work is they're

63
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,820
just designed to look for big payoffs spread out over a portfolio of companies.

64
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,140
So I'm a venture capitalist I invest in 99 companies 99 of my companies all just fail returning nothing

65
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,970
to me that's bad for me.

66
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,830
But if I gave one more investment and that one investment turned into Facebook guess what I'm the best

67
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,780
venture capitalist in the land.

68
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,630
I crushed it.

69
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,450
So maybe you can guess what question might we want to answer for them.

70
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:01,330
They're primarily going to care about how big you can grow and potentially how fast no sense in them

71
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,960
investing in 100 companies or 50 of them.

72
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,180
Literally cannot grow large enough to pay off the losses from the other ones.

73
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,310
So there are a lot of ways that we could split this.

74
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,740
But what's at least one way of segmenting our customers such that we can show the possibility to replicate

75
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,560
this process again many ways actually to do that.

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,300
So don't blame me if you copy this and your your venture capital pitch doesn't go very well but this

77
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,570
is one way we can do it.

78
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,530
So what I would propose is why not segment users by location.

79
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,690
The assumption is you'll do multiple cities.

80
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,110
Right.

81
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,170
So if you list them out by city you can easily see the profit potential of each group and then naturally

82
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,140
you can tell hey there's a lot of other cities that are not on this map.

83
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,520
That's a very easy one to do.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,070
To show look how much money I made in this one spot.

85
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,120
Now multiply that by 5000.

86
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,430
All right now the last scenario let's say we were deciding if we could personally swing this with our

87
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,410
own money bootstrap it.

88
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,680
Well in that case maybe we want to know the breakeven like the bank situation or maybe you want to see

89
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,590
how small we can start this and still make it profitable relatively quickly.

90
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:21,940
If it were the second option we're thinking hey why do we need a 50000 square foot space when that might

91
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,880
legitimately bankrupt me.

92
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,920
Why not instead get a 5000 square foot space to start off with and then use the cash flow to expand.

93
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:36,670
Well in that case savvy entrepreneur we might care about how our customers and specifically how much

94
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:44,170
space our customers take up permanent offices will take dedicated space that you can't use for anything

95
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,470
else whereas the shared desk folk don't need assigned space.

96
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:54,880
But you know always you can't oversell that type of customer or you won't have enough space in any given

97
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,120
day for them and they get mad.

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,440
In this case maybe you can calculate how much square footage each customer type might take and then

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,160
you just segment by the regular user type share desk versus private desk versus small office versus

100
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,340
large office.

101
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,330
That way we can focus on how much space we need and how much money we can make per the space by adjusting

102
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,700
the way we focus on private offices versus share desks.

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,050
OK so you see there are a million different ways to segment any given scenario.

104
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,350
Usually you would segment these in the most vanilla way you can.

105
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,530
And then if there are specific questions you need to sawle then break out a separate sheet.

106
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:41,350
You do your separate but more obscure segmentation to answer these separate but not main questions.

107
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,450
It highly depends on the situation you're in.

108
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,390
All right guys I will see you in the next Lochore.
