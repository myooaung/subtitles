1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,100
All right.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,310
So welcome back to the you works case study part 2.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,110
This is the summary Now we've done the revenues and we've done the expenses.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,310
So in the summary we can just kind of put it all together.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:14,590
Right.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,790
A lot of times it's very useful to visualize the timing and then the all the revenue related assumptions.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,270
So it's not kicking in it's not doing anything until afterwards.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:24,630
Right.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,800
And you see that now one of the things when you're building models like this where it goes really far

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,390
to the right.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,340
But you've got these columns here and the months up there a useful thing to do is to go to layouts and

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,820
there's something called Free's pain.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,120
And if you freeze pain with you make sure that we keep the headers for ourselves so you can see the

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,150
months and we can see the labels wherever we go in the model to see that they're so very useful to see.

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,010
So then we see that right now is when it starts to be active everything else before that was kind of

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,770
trying to get it ready to launch it.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,980
And then this is when we start to get some sales and start to build up.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
But early part of it is has a lot of startup related costs right.

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,470
So for this one here we bought the building and had some initial Permatang spend and is still permitting

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,230
then we start the construction period.

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,300
Construction is quite expensive.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,260
And after you can search construction with the launch.

23
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:29,640
Here is the headcount earlier on is maybe just some senior team and some early hires and then it was

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,870
getting all the associates and others there that is needed.

25
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,520
And then slowly increasing the headcount over time.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,320
So then we also have the comp. And the other overhead expenses in any of your monthly expenses.

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,140
Now again the monthly expenses we had them only kicking in in month 15 but none earlier than that because

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
it wasn't launch yet.

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,830
You're not running the facility full blast.

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,110
You're not doing a lot of other things or you're not spending as much at that time.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,620
Okay.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,720
Are we just going to assume it's 0 before then.

33
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:06,780
Now if you wanted to do some sort of a lower spend before that you know like maybe you have like utilities

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,670
where you think hey it's just us and is no.

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,300
You know people there were you spending maybe 30 percent of the utility run rate the way to do that

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:23,850
then is we go to the the monthly thing here and we can start something in month 1 I just say pre launch

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,430
utilities.

38
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,120
Right.

39
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,940
And you know it's maybe it's 2300 instead of 1000.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,450
And then so it then goes like that.

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,870
So then we have that earlier spend in when we go back to the summary.

42
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:44,550
Now that other Monkley spend now we got that 4300 early on as the pre-launch utilities and then post-launch

43
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,690
will have some of that.

44
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,820
So now the only thing you got to do is you need to adjust that down as make sure that this is the difference

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,810
of what you have right.

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,710
So post-launch if you want the total to be 5000 post-launch then this needs to be 3500 Now that's how

47
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,660
you can do it in such a way where after launch it's still 5000.

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,730
What we did before but we have some lower amount initially.

49
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,960
Now that's there.

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,830
So then we have our total spen total cash flow out.

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,370
So during the startup period we have no revenues so it's just all cash out.

52
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,170
That's why it's all negative like this.

53
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,090
But once we start generating some money and we stop spending on the startup we're going to be cash flow

54
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,280
positive right.

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,080
And as we grow the number of customers we're going to start to grow our revenue per month.

56
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,480
So then what we do is if we look at the cumulative cash position so we look at net whether it was spent

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,260
or earned I and keep track just keep tracking that the net cash cumulative position.

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,980
We can then calculate what is the most that we're going to need in terms of the cash flow.

59
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,160
So the the biggest point the biggest cash the cash need happens towards the end of startup which is

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,880
not surprising right because that's your are you spending all that money and it adds up.

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,210
Well that part that is the maximum that is the cash that you need to calculate the max cash deficit

62
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,920
since is a negative number we use the mean function to find that we found that there and then we can

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,360
go back to where the startup thing is and put something here.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,020
So we kind of can have a little bit of padding.

65
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,140
So here's the max cash deficit that we calculated earlier.

66
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,230
We added another 10 percent of contingency or padding to it.

67
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,840
So then we calculate our total funding asset base aren't all funding us.

68
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,910
And here's all the startup costs then the difference is that working capital mostly coming from contingency

69
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:37,580
but is it's helpful for you to have that to make sure that you do have some wiggle room to do your launch.

70
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,350
So there you have it.

71
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,330
This is a more complete you works business model which is not just the revenue but we're looking at

72
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:53,070
the expenses we're looking at the then the cash statement the whole cash flow and to calculate how much

73
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,230
cash is needed to actually launch.
