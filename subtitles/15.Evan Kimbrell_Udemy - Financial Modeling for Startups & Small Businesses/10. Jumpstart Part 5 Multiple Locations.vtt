00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.480
Hey welcome back to the course in the last lecture we updated the model to account for the strawberry

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.020
premium.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.810
Anna now your profits for this first location has you feeling really confident you think you can repeat

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.170
the success at multiple locations and you've been scoping out other locations and have found some great

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.330
options to open for more locations.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.930
You even have customers asking you hey what are you going to open a stand closer to them.

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.780
So you want to expand but you are still a one person shop right now.

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.820
So if you're going to open new locations you're going to need to hire.

9
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.680
So he has to run the lemonade stands for you.

10
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.490
That way you can focus on growth and you can still handle the prep at the commissary kitchen but you're

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.130
going to need help running the stand.

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.080
So in order to update our model we can just only add four more locations.

13
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.190
We got to update it to account for an additional operating expense labor.

14
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.780
Now you can Tricare nephews nieces into free child labor to sell the lemonades for you.

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.390
So for simplicity we're just going to assume that you're going to be financing these new locations from

16
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630
the profits that you saved up.

17
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.720
You're going to open a new location every two months until you get to five locations.

18
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.780
So how would the revenue look like for the first two years if we make this kind of uptick.

19
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.390
Let's see.

20
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.190
All right let's get ready to build the multiple locations financial model for our lemonade business.

21
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.340
Right.

22
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.650
So for this one we're going to build a model that handles 5 locations which means for each location

23
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.470
we're going to have to track our assumptions differently number than our first model.

24
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.870
We had something like this where we have the assumptions about the days the step we're selling the foot

25
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.680
traffic the stop percentage purchase percentage of the average Cupps for purchase.

26
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.910
Well those things might be different now depending on which location it is right.

27
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.340
Maybe some locations we can open more days or they have different traffic they have different stop percentages

28
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.740
things like just like when we were comparing the locations A B and C before to try to pick the right

29
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.210
location.

30
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.700
When we open new locations they may all have different attributes.

31
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.730
So we're going to have to keep track of them separately.

32
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.320
In addition to the location though is we're not going to open all at once.

33
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.620
Right.

34
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.250
So we will open the first location we're trying to use our own funding to open the next locations we

35
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.750
want to stagger the opening of the other locations maybe we want to learn a little bit and give her

36
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.440
selves time to ramp up and stabilize the previous location before we go on to the next one.

37
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.170
So we're going to add an additional assumption here called the startlement location one is going to

38
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.640
start in the first month but then we're going to start the other ones later.

39
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.070
So right now I'm just going to put in assumption here that we're going to start in months 3 5 7 9 for

40
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.550
the other locations basically every other month.

41
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.750
We're going to launch another location until we have all five locations launched.

42
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:26.460
Now the economics of the sales of the cups of the costs and the revenues per cup are going to be the

43
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.330
same right.

44
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.040
We saw the same assumptions here.

45
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.620
Now the percentage that buys the strawberry I'm going to leave it here for now and assume is the same

46
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.910
for all locations and when we're done with this exercise I'll leave it as a challenge for those of you

47
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.470
that want to try to make this assumption changeable for each location and then factor that into the

48
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.480
rest of the the model here.

49
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.230
Okay but that would be a challenge for those of you that want to try that.

50
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.430
So let's think about this now as we grow for multiple locations and we want to operate in multiple locations.

51
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.680
We have different assumptions for each location but we also need to make an additional assumption about

52
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.550
how it's going to operate.

53
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.190
Basically you can't be the person you can't be that Hendee or associate working.

54
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.350
All of those locations you might at work.

55
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.020
Most work one location.

56
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.740
But if you're going to be growing to multiple locations chances are you want to focus on growth and

57
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.960
doing the Manage your earlier work not working the specific locations.

58
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.570
So if you're not going to be working it then somebody else is going to be working there.

59
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.360
Right.

60
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.890
So what are you going to have to assume there.

61
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.480
You're going to have to assume that you're going to need to pay someone to work there.

62
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.080
Right.

63
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.840
So we still have the hours of operations which is the same as before or five hours per day.

64
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.180
But now we've got to pay an associate some sort of a wage rate and the hours of OPS is not enough.

65
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.690
You're also going to pay them for some additional setup per shift.

66
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.720
Maybe it takes them an hour to open another hour to break down.

67
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.090
Right so we're going to have two hours of additional labor hours per shift.

68
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.070
OK.

69
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.410
So now we have this we have this main set up structure.

70
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.990
We know what kind of assumptions we have here.

71
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.020
And then we know we are going to have multiple locations let's do the model for that location one Furse.

72
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.560
So for location 1 now everything pretty much looks exactly the same except for the gray stuff.

73
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.780
Those are the new things right.

74
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.660
The gray is what we're adding new now these assumptions are coming in from our main page here.

75
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.990
Okay.

76
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.190
Called combined revenues.

77
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:53.270
So all these assumptions around the price for a cup and you know hourly wage all that is coming from

78
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.430
the front so we're not changing so anything in blue means it's coming pulling from another page right

79
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.890
now the stuffing grades the stuff that we got to do.

80
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.180
All right.

81
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.530
So that's new right now.

82
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:12.170
Now here's the first part here is we want to we want to do something that shows when it's actually in

83
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.170
operation.

84
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.430
Right.

85
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:21.360
Because if if it's safe location 2 it comes in operation in my 3.

86
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.700
Then we wanted to start in month three and not in month one.

87
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.350
So right now for location 1 if I change this to 3 and then we go to the location one.

88
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.220
Here are the calculations.

89
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:41.140
This operation now creates a kind of a dummy variable that tells me when this is operating.

90
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.730
Okay.

91
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:49.020
So the way to do that is to use the months.

92
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.370
Okay.

93
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.050
Because we're already telling us what month we want it to operate.

94
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.630
Right.

95
00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:01.530
So what the formula is saying is if the month is greater than the start month minus one.

96
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:08.270
And the reason we do the minus one is if it starts in month 3 we want it to start in my free and not

97
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.580
calculate to month 4.

98
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.830
Right.

99
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:16.660
So what's greater than 3 minus 1 or 3 is greater than 3 minus 1 which is 2.

100
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.410
So it starts in month 3.

101
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.710
So let's look at that again.

102
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.940
If the month is greater then the starting month right now is three.

103
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.780
We're set at 2 3.

104
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.590
This can change.

105
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.320
But right now is 3.

106
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:40.910
If the month is greater than 3 minus 1 which is 2 then make it equal to one otherwise is zero.

107
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.240
OK so here's a very common formula that we're going to be using.

108
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.760
It's very popular for me.

109
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.450
It is called an IF formula right here.

110
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.510
Now IF formula starts with a logical test.

111
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:58.290
So my logical test is something that you that the you're trying to say is either true or false.

112
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.730
Is this true or false.

113
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:00.870
If it's true.

114
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.750
Put this in there.

115
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.320
Otherwise put that in the cell.

116
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.050
And that's what we're doing with this formula.

117
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:07.460
Right.

118
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:17.780
So we're saying is the month greater than the start month minus 1 if it is a 1 if it's not put a zero.

119
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:25.000
So when we have the start of at 3 then we say is three greater than three minus one.

120
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.780
Yes.

121
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.600
Put one.

122
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.330
No.

123
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.870
Here is start month two.

124
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.310
Greater than three minus one.

125
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.080
No.

126
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.520
2 is equal to two.

127
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.840
So then it's zero.

128
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:44.770
OK so when we have this dummy variable we can then do is for the day saying all right we're pulling

129
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.800
this from the front again.

130
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.460
How many days were selling for for each location.

131
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:55.870
So this one as we're setting it up for what we can do is we can make this roll here that day selling

132
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.990
times the operating cell here.

133
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.260
So if it's zero it's going to make it zero.

134
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.120
It's not going to come through.

135
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:10.190
But if it's one then the day's selling value from the front is going to come through.

136
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.930
So what that does is it basically creates a gate for whether the calculation is the important calculation

137
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.160
of days or selling whether it's active or not.

138
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.830
We'll actually calculate.

139
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.730
So we can set a gate for that.

140
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.630
And that way when ever it moves especially as it's more relevant for the other locations where there

141
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:39.790
are some 5 7 or 9 everything will automatically adjust because we adjusted these formulas here.

142
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:49.380
So I'm going to just grade this out too so we can know that that's been adjusted from what we were doing

143
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.190
before.

144
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.500
Now everything else here is the same.

145
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:58.560
There's really no change the only thing that we made it I made an adjustment to from what we did before

146
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.720
is a stylistic change that you may want to consider that you didn't introduce in the last two lectures

147
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.780
just to keep it simple.

148
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.540
Is it things that are expenses.

149
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.120
Make it a negative number and format it so that it's colored in red.

150
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:21.300
OK so what you can do is you can basically select the cells you want to format it a certain way select

151
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.030
the cells you've right click and go to format cells.

152
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:31.500
And when you do that it gives you some options if it's currency you quit currency and it gives you some

153
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.080
options how you want to display the negative numbers.

154
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.650
Does it do you want to display it with a negative sign or just read.

155
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.330
I like to do with both so it's super clear.

156
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.970
It's you know there's no question about it.

157
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:45.640
Right.

158
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.670
OK.

159
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:53.910
And it will it will do that but it will change it too with decimals so you can adjust that back if you

160
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.260
want.

161
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:54.980
OK.

162
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.350
That's the only difference right now.

163
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.120
So we have everything that looks the same but what do we got to do.

164
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.070
Now we got to calculate an additional cost right.

165
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.490
We have the hours and the wages for the location.

166
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:16.620
So let's do that right now the total set up hours is going to equal to the additional hours of setup

167
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.460
per chef.

168
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:17.750
Right.

169
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.700
Set up hours per shift.

170
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.460
Remember we did.

171
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.430
We can use the labeling to do that.

172
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:30.740
Times the total days in operation.

173
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.150
All right.

174
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.980
So that would be that one row four.

175
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:42.430
OK so we have that and then total selling hours is going to equal to the hours of operations per day

176
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.140
times the number of days selling as well.

177
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.200
Now we have the total hours that are worked right.

178
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.520
We have total set up hours plus the total hours actually behind a stand selling.

179
00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.520
So we're going to do that in a copyright and we're going to pace that to see what it looks like.

180
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:06.650
OK so it looks like we're going to be doing paying about 28 hours of labor per month.

181
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:14.210
Now the total wages is going to be the total hours work times the Whurley wage rate which is in Cell

182
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.350
B 11.

183
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.150
So those are the total wages.

184
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.410
But again it's going to be an expense rate.

185
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:31.630
So we want to make this negative okay because we want to see it as a red and a negative number.

186
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.270
Okay.

187
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.700
So now we have that.

188
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:41.510
So now what do we have in terms of total cost of operations right which includes the cost of goods sold

189
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.920
for the lemonade and all the things that went into a cup of lemonade but you're also going to have to

190
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:55.300
pay the labor costs because you're not operating anymore so then now we have this as a total costs and

191
00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:06.340
then what we have in terms of the profits it's going to be the total revenue plus the negative costs

192
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.030
of operation all of it.

193
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:14.680
So just make sure you get your signs right and then if you copy and paste that you have all of the profits

194
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.650
there.

195
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.730
So making that adjustment to a location is actually not that difficult when you think it through and

196
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.390
think about what you need to add.

197
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.200
Right.

198
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.030
So now now we have this single location model.

199
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:35.660
We have it able to adjust by the hour by the way when it's going to start.

200
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:36.220
Right.

201
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.530
And it can take its own assumptions around all of these key assumptions.

202
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:47.710
So what can we do now how do we do location's 2 3 4 5 what we're going to do something like this just

203
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.770
create another sheet with Kishan too.

204
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.410
Okay.

205
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.070
And we're just going to copy all of this control.

206
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:04.960
All of this copy all of this copy it into the other one.

207
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.570
Or you can just make a copy of the worksheet.

208
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.930
Another way is to do this.

209
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.370
You go move or make a copy.

210
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:19.990
You go create a copy move it somewhere where you can know where it's at right.

211
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.640
So now this is an exact copy that may be easier way to do that so let's just do that instead instead

212
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.290
of the first way.

213
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.080
So we have a copy here and let's make it four.

214
00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:35.020
This is going to be for location location too.

215
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.630
OK.

216
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.410
So then how do we make it work for location's who Rhyno is an exact copy of vocation once everything

217
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.830
works the same way as location.

218
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:51.490
So the way we got to just that then is we've got to make the assumptions flow from location to assumptions

219
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.840
because right now is calling from here.

220
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.610
We need to call it from here.

221
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.160
OK.

222
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.930
So how do we do that we look at here.

223
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:05.860
This was calling from location 1 so we're going to call it from location to which is basically the next

224
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:13.470
column over k and then once we do that we got to make sure we copy that formula across.

225
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:13.950
OK.

226
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.920
So here the same thing.

227
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.830
We had an assumption there.

228
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.180
So we're going to make it from Column G.

229
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.760
And we're going to copy that and see that this is called calling from F.

230
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.410
We're just going to change it to G.

231
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.500
Now the answer is different.

232
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:38.310
This one is calling from half we're going to call it from G.

233
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.750
G.

234
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:49.730
And we're going to do the same for these two remaining two assumptions here.

235
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:55.870
So just make sure you changed all of the assumptions that are calling there if you kind of don't remember.

236
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.910
Look over here you have 2 4 6 things that needed to change right and we change six things we change

237
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.160
one here one here and then these other four here.

238
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.560
So now we have this.

239
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:16.440
And if you repeat the process by making copies and then changing those formulas but to call from these

240
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:23.190
different columns for each of the locations you're going to end up with something like this where you

241
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:30.840
have a separate page for each location and that's calling from the different assumptions for each of

242
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.790
the locations.

243
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:39.810
So now once you have this what you can do is then you can aggregate all of these calculations so you

244
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:48.620
can look at your entire business for as a combined entity right between all of those sent out.

245
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.860
This part here there's a summary here.

246
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.640
This is very straightforward to do.

247
00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.170
So I'm not going to walk you through all of the little details of how to do this.

248
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:09.370
It's basically this entire PNL here but pulling from all the locations.

249
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:17.110
OK so if we look at monthly foot traffic going to have location 1 through 5 and I just pull from the

250
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:22.790
foot traffic rolls from each of the location then the stops do the same and do the same.

251
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:23.590
Right.

252
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:31.630
And when you can do that this way I can look at any location and see when we're starting right now.

253
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.250
OK location 1 2 starting month three.

254
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.120
This is starting month 5 7 9 and so forth.

255
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.520
And if I change some of these assumptions back to something this summary is going to change and it's

256
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.600
going to tell me what it looks like overall.

257
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.100
If I change my main assumptions.

258
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:51.810
Right.

259
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:57.910
And when you do the P.A. here what you can do is once you do it for all the locations for each other

260
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.110
line items that are relevant right.

261
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:10.030
So I have all the line items here all the things here and now what you can do is I can hide.

262
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:18.030
You can group the group those locations together and then where you can go.

263
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:26.750
Data says group if you go to the data work sheet and you go group and then you go grouped together then

264
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.140
you create this little tag here on the site.

265
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:33.640
There's a little bracket with a minus sign and what you can do is you click it.

266
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.920
You can hide it.

267
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.830
So now I can hide all those locations if I just want to look at the overall view.

268
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.450
Right.

269
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.920
Just Of all the locations combined.

270
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.050
Look at the individual location.

271
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.360
That I can do that.

272
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:54.050
I can just kind of do this accordion effect and hide everything.

273
00:18:54.050 --> 00:19:05.280
So now I can look at this piano here this 12 months of sales information and look at what it looks like

274
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.740
for the first 24 months.

275
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:14.150
But if I did want to look at any particular location I can expand it and kind of dive into the there

276
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.030
without having to go into any particular worksheet.

277
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:24.680
So based on these assumptions we see that hey we're you know we're going to be making about a thousand

278
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.820
profit the first two months.

279
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.730
But then we add the second location we're going to go to 16:00.

280
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:35.520
We have a third location we get about 3000 at the fourth location which you know is the fourth locations

281
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.680
quite quite a bit of a jump because you know where there's a lot more traffic.

282
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.470
We're operating more days.

283
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.240
So it's going to be a bigger bump.

284
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:50.420
And then once we at the fifth location we jump a little bit more and then it looks like with five locations

285
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.430
we can expect to make a little over 7000 profits every month.

286
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.640
So there you go.

287
00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:07.340
We went from a simple lemonade stand with one product to a lemonade stand with a premium add on to a

288
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:16.280
lemonade business with five lemonade stands and you can see how even though those assumptions are changes

289
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.110
of what you're trying to look at sounds really simple.

290
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:26.960
Executing it in modeling in Excel can look complicated if you don't have a structured way of thinking

291
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.490
about it and modeling it out.

292
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.850
So we're going to be doing a lot more of this now.

293
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:41.180
Don't worry if some of this is Fahs just pause go look at the formulas compare it compare the solution

294
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:48.160
with what you've done and then you know we're going to cover all of these topics again in greater detail

295
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.520
and you're going to have a lot more examples that are pulled from examples that are probably going to

296
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.720
be more relevant to you.
