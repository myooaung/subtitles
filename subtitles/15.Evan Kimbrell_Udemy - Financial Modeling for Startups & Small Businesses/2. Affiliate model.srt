00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,700
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture to explore a new business model called the affiliate

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,140
business model.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,630
Have you ever heard of Herbalife.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,720
You know that company that no one can figure out what they do and they're somehow in front of your face

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,350
everytime you watch the world's most hated and most loved sports team Manchester United.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,940
Well I know what they do and I will tell you they sell lotion and nonperishable food.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,500
Very strange combination.

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,530
There's a whole lot of other things that are not interesting or new.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,770
But the way they make their money is through using an affiliate business model.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,630
Yes.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,960
They are also a pyramid scheme.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,330
But don't let a couple of details get in the way.

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,990
And yes there is someone who bet a billion dollars that Herbalife would fail in the next five years.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,530
OK.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,860
Not all the affiliate marketing models are pyramid schemes pyramid schemes are businesses where you

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,580
only sell to people inside of your business with very very shady sales techniques and shady promises.

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,920
Affiliates are when you sell a product that someone else makes and you're just in charge of getting

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,870
people to buy it.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,820
So maybe Herbalife is not a great example.

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,900
Let's use another one.

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,360
Never use the site app sumo.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,510
They promote deals to subscribers at really low rates.

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,700
Another one that might come to mind.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,710
Groupon Groupon is technically an affiliate business model.

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:29,040
Well in the case of Groupon after the other kind of work through this mysterious affiliate model as

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,830
well as any blogger that's ever e-mailed you saying oh my god I just found the greatest yoga mat and

27
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,610
it's only available for the next 48 hours through this very specific link.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,150
They're probably using the affiliate business model and while when you pull back the curtain it's actually

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,520
not that mysterious.

30
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:52,860
You see the way it works is that an affiliate operates a business whereby they sell someone else's product

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,710
that is it in a nutshell they're in charge of promoting the product.

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,200
Dressing it up and getting people to buy it whether someone buys it then the supplier fulfills the order

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,220
and gives the affiliate a piece of the revenue for the supplier.

34
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,470
It's a no brainer.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,040
Hey I'd like to sell your stuff.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,770
Just give me a portion of the sales.

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,050
You have to do anything.

38
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,320
And it's kind of like free money in the Herbalife example the individual owners what they actually call

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,850
them.

40
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,210
They each go out and sell Herbalife solution on their own.

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,310
Usually it's to their Facebook friends and then they reap a certain percentage of the return on the

42
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:26,940
sale.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,950
If we were to draw it the way this model Flo looks like it looks something kind of like this it's a

44
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,040
big circle.

45
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,530
The first step from the perspective of the affiliate is to drive traffic to the product or service they're

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,700
trying to sell.

47
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,790
Not necessarily traffic but attention in general.

48
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,030
In the case the affiliate uses a good old fashioned ad then yeah they will see an ad oftentimes an ad

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,270
inside of an email then they click through the ad to the page selling the product then the user decides

50
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,860
to buy the affiliate product.

51
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,770
Then the company that creates the product pays you the affiliate based on your sale affiliate commissions

52
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,140
range anywhere from 25 percent all the way up to 75.

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,410
I've see 90 percent sometimes the most common methods you see affiliates use is posting ads for products

54
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:20,230
directly on their site which is actually different from a CPA arrangement than we talked about earlier.

55
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,630
Although it is pretty close.

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,260
Usually with an affiliate there is a more close relationship and they're following a bunch of rules

57
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,880
and guidelines set by the publisher It was a CPA and it's a little bit more hands off.

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,290
Really it's a distinction that's not really important or worth knowing.

59
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,650
Generally in the case an affiliate.

60
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,580
Well they'll usually do is send out an email to the list that they've spent a lot of time building out

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:52,050
like promoting the product or they might write an entire post that conveniently highlights the product

62
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,420
in the right spots.

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,690
OK it sounds pretty simple right.

64
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,260
Well let's take a look at how it looks on an actual model.

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,220
Take it from here.

66
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,960
Mr. Simon now the affiliate model isn't going to look all that different from what we did with the ad

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,650
model.

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,640
In this scenario we're still looking at ads.

69
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:10,850
Right.

70
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,840
But in this case you're going to be paying for some sort of ads.

71
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:20,790
Maybe you're paying in terms of the CPC costs and then you're trying to convert those that click on

72
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,190
your ads into purchases of some product that you're trying to promote and you're going to be keeping

73
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,540
some commission of that right.

74
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:39,470
So if we have these figures as a given maybe we're you know trying to get 5 million impressions.

75
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:47,970
And you know you can get about a 5 percent click through rate then than then the number of clicks is

76
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,590
going to be the click through rate times the ad impressions you have.

77
00:04:52,780 --> 00:05:03,160
And then if you're paying a dollar of 25 for each click then you're total costs for the clicks is going

78
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,910
to be the cost per click times the total number of clicks.

79
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,020
OK so that's going to be your cost right here.

80
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:19,620
And if you can convert say 2 percent of those clicks into purchases then the conversion percentage times

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:28,820
the number of clicks that land on your site or that goes through your sales funnel whatever that is.

82
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,420
That's the number of purchases that you have.

83
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,670
Right.

84
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:39,020
So let's say you're pushing a product that's two ninety and you get to keep 60 percent of any sales

85
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,910
that you make.

86
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,320
Right.

87
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,780
So the gross sales gross revenue is going to be the retail value times the number of purchases.

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,530
Right.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,260
And your commission is going to be the commission rate times the gross revenue.

90
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:03,240
So then your profit will be your commission minus what it cost you to drive all of that traffic right.

91
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,160
Is your advertising traffic.

92
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:17,150
So with this simple model you can quickly get an idea of what your expected profits will be given that

93
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,770
you are confident about these numbers and that you can achieve them.

94
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:29,180
So how would a revenue model look so let's look at a 12 month model again.

95
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,350
Now we're going to get rid of these columns because we don't want to look at them.

96
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:45,830
And so we have 12 months here let's say that it's going to take us 12 months to get to this ad spend.

97
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,850
We don't want to spend that much yet.

98
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,180
We're going to slowly work our way up there.

99
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,480
OK.

100
00:06:51,490 --> 00:07:01,880
So we're going to make this the 12th month ad spend equal to that on the front where we're looking at

101
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,500
and it's going to take us 12 months to get there.

102
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:19,110
So we're going to say the starting point is going to equal to the total that we want to get to.

103
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,420
Divided by 12 months.

104
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,660
OK.

105
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,990
So that's what we're going to start off in the first month and then we're going to slowly build up every

106
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,530
month until we get to that value.

107
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:35,400
So then the next month is going to be the previous month plus this value.

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,750
But now we want to make sure we fix that reference because we're going to keep referring to it.

109
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,390
Divide it by 12.

110
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,940
And then now we're incrementing the ad spend.

111
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,360
Right.

112
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:57,470
And if we copy this formula through to the eleventh month we'll get this even spread of kind of flat

113
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,060
growth.

114
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,650
OK.

115
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,890
So again now we're going to need to look at the CPC assumption right.

116
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,600
We're going to pull it from the front here whatever we put in here we put in 125 or we're going to make

117
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,150
it refer to 125.

118
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,010
In terms of the leads that we're going to have for the business.

119
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:26,140
All right your ad spend about how many cost per click then that's how many clicks or how many leads

120
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,730
that you're going to have to your site.

121
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,050
Right.

122
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,150
So we're going to take the ads when we're going to divide it by the CPC and we're going to fix that

123
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,490
reference there.

124
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:43,760
So then now we have this sort of number of leads based on that ads.

125
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,300
Right.

126
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,010
So then our conversion expectation we're going to pull it from the front.

127
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,280
Again let's call this it was 2 percent.

128
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,860
Now I'll explain why I have the rest of this in gray.

129
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,090
Just when we're done with the rest of this can be a little extra challenge for us.

130
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,040
Right now we're just going to use this 2 percent.

131
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:13,470
So then the conversions out of all those leads in terms of purchases is just going to be the leads times

132
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,110
the conversion rate right.

133
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,420
Now we can copy and paste the rest.

134
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,030
And this is the monthly purchases.

135
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,990
The convergence we're assuming the same product.

136
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,200
So we're going to reference the retail value of this product.

137
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,860
And we're also going to reference the same commission.

138
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,350
So we have these values here.

139
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,650
So now if we look at it over the 12 months it's pretty straightforward right.

140
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,680
Very similar we have the gross revenues going to be the total number of purchases times the retail value

141
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,990
and then the net commissions is going to be the gross revenue times the commission

142
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:14,910
and then the profits will be the net commissions minus the actual outspan here.

143
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,580
So once we have all three of these done we can copy you can select the rest and paste it now as a sanity

144
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,000
check.

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,840
Remember what we did in the previous one.

146
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,030
Here we can write the if statement or we can just make it equal to what we want to check.

147
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:35,850
Right here we're just going to see if it's the same Samedi equal to the profit from the front.

148
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,590
And we know in month 12 we have the same ad spend the same amount of leads everything is the same so

149
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,190
the profits should be the same as what we calculated in the front.

150
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,660
And it is so we know we did this model correctly.

151
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,280
Now there you go.

152
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,210
Here is a simple revenue model for an affiliate business.

153
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,910
Right.

154
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:05,080
Based on ads fan and your that drives a certain amount of leads that you can expect and with the conversion

155
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,180
percentage then you have the purchases.

156
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:15,250
Now if if you're doing something like this one thing that we could upgrade in terms of the model is

157
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,090
you would hope that you're getting a little bit better with your conversions over time.

158
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,190
Right.

159
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,760
Maybe this is what you're starting out at and your conversion might be better over time maybe you could

160
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,150
get to 4 percent by by the end of the 12 months.

161
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,540
Right.

162
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:41,750
So what if you had a conversion schedule here and how would you improve on this model if you had all

163
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,370
this.

164
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:42,690
Okay.

165
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,460
So that's a challenge for you guys if you want to do that challenge make this a conversion schedule

166
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,130
and then update the correct rest of the model to see how that would change your model.
