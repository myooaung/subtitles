00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.090
Hey welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.370
Now in this lecture we're going to talk about the subscription revenue model.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.020
This is something that you probably are a customer of.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.730
Do you subscribe to something like Spotfire to listen to music on a monthly basis.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.170
Do you subscribe to services like Dropbox or Evernote.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.700
Anything that you're paying a regular amount for usually monthly sometimes annually for a service you

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.090
are on a subscription base business.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.390
Now when you have something like this if you've been paying attention to our previous lecture on the

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.490
freemium model it's going to look very similar.

10
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.940
Instead of going from free to premium we have some sort of a lead that gets converted into a subscriber.

11
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.260
Now the thing that we're going to throw into this lecture to make it a little bit more interesting is

12
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.050
what if you had three different subscription tiers How would you model something like that out.

13
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.150
Let's take a look.

14
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.310
Hey let's start with a quick sanity check first.

15
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.450
So it's going to look very similar right.

16
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.840
We might start with some sort of first group of users they may download an app or they may register

17
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.770
on your site but then only some of them are actually going to be really hot leads some of them are actually

18
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.910
going to continue to use a service or actually start using your app.

19
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.150
And we're just going to call that group activated.

20
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.210
OK.

21
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.900
And and out of that group you're going to be able to convert some percentage of them into subscription

22
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.130
customers.

23
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.020
So in our example if we started with the million here and 85 percent gets activated making a hundred

24
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.420
fifty thousand and if 2 percent are converted then you're converting 17000 subscribers and the rest

25
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.090
are staying as free users are continuing to use your service or come to your site.

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.810
But the 2 percent that some 10000 is paying some sort of subscription fee.

27
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.850
So if your subscription fee was $19 then your subscription revenue for that group of users will be 300

28
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.270
23000.

29
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.420
Now the question depends on what kind of subscription fee this is right.

30
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
Could be an annual could be a monthly.

31
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.270
So you know what time period that applies to is going to affect how you're looking at this revenue range.

32
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.740
Okay so let's see what one plans subscription model might look like.

33
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:32.220
So let's assume these are given right these monthly downloads registrations and there's a certain activation

34
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.880
rate we're activating that many per month.

35
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.570
And then the conversion rates coming from the front and we're going to also take the subscription fee.

36
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.180
We'll make this a monthly subscription fee right now.

37
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.620
And how will we then calculate in this model here.

38
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.860
Right.

39
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.650
Let it go up to 24 months Well this one's going to be pretty straightforward right.

40
00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:03.390
The new monthly number of free users is going to equal to 1 minus the conversion rate that becomes subscription

41
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.580
users times the activated users and then the number of subscription users you can do 2 percent times

42
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.510
the monthly activated or you can just go the total minus the free range.

43
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.840
So they have to add up.

44
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.610
So you can do it either way.

45
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.980
So once you have that you can copy pace to the other columns.

46
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:35.190
Now we have the number of new subscribers right but every scriber is going to be paying a subscription

47
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.190
fee every month.

48
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.310
So we can't just look at the Monthly's so new subscribers we get to look at the cumulative subscribers

49
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.100
in any given month.

50
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.790
So in the first month the total number of subscribers will just be equal to the number of news servers

51
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.670
but then the second month is going to be the previous month plus the new one.

52
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.080
Right.

53
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.590
So then the cumulative is what's going to add up here.

54
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.290
Okay.

55
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.290
And then we have the 19 dollar subscription fee there.

56
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.700
So then the total subscription revenue in a given month is going to be the scription fee times the number

57
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.160
of subscribers for that given month.

58
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.800
So there is the simple one.

59
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.920
Now for those of you that are looking at this you're probably thinking Hey where's the attrition.

60
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.670
That's a challenge for you to add.

61
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.190
You should be able to do that by now.

62
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.510
All right.

63
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.560
So that was the single planned subscription model.

64
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.670
What if we have multiple subscription plans though how would we model that out.

65
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.680
Let's take a look.

66
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.760
So here everything up here is same as in the previous worksheet we have the same numbers but now we

67
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.500
have three plans.

68
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.610
ABC at different prices.

69
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.740
So if we're going to have different plans what we need then is we need to have different breakdowns

70
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.130
in terms of the percentage breakdown of the subscribers that fall in each plan.

71
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.450
Right.

72
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.770
So here one of the best practices when it comes to dividing in segmenting groups in you've seen me probably

73
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.960
do this a couple times already is to make sure that all the plans add up to 100 percent.

74
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.510
And the way to do that if you're making them as inputs is to leave one as a calculation.

75
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:26.480
So if I have a here and B here as inputs then the last one is going to be one minus the sum of these

76
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.350
right so I subtract the other two.

77
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.160
That way the combination of all three always adds up to 100 percent.

78
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.480
So that's one way to avoid kind of the error if you put in the wrong numbers and you end up having 100

79
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.100
plus percent are not 100 percent.

80
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.800
And that would be an error in your model.

81
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.540
OK so then now how do we calculate the rest of these.

82
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.500
So these are going to be fairly straightforward.

83
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:56.880
Right so the number of subscribers in each plan is going to equal to the total number of subscribers

84
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.170
times the actual percentage that falls into that group.

85
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.200
So notice the references here right.

86
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.440
I want to make sure I've referenced this row only.

87
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.950
But for these here I want to reference just this column by I do want it to move down in terms of the

88
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.820
formulas.

89
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.900
When I copy it down the line.

90
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:24.350
So if I copy this then I can paste the rest and it will calculate the number of subscribers in each

91
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.020
plan for any given month.

92
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:36.030
Then the revenue is going to be the subscription fee for that Flann times the number of subscribers

93
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.740
in that plan in that month.

94
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:46.590
So now we can copy this down and copy this across as well and we'll have these different revenues for

95
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.180
these different plans.

96
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.920
And if we take the sum of all these now we have the total subscription revenue.

97
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.810
So there you go.

98
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.270
Pretty simple to build out you know a one or even a multiple planned subscription revenue model.
