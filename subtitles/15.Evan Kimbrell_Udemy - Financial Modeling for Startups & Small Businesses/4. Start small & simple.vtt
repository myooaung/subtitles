Welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:10.890
Another best practice for building models is to start small and simple and then slowly layer on more

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.090
complexity.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.300
You shouldn't try to tackle the complicated stuff until you've gotten the easy stuff out of the way.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.030
That's why we didn't start off with five locations for our lemonade business until we got one location

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.680
down or why we didn't start with two products to sell until we figured out how to model one product.

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.760
As entrepreneurs I know you might be inclined to just jump in and try to build the model that you're

8
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.670
looking for on your first try.

9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.250
Don't do it.

10
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.050
Choose a simple and easy one first.

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.970
Break it into multiple steps.

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.120
If you're evaluating multiple revenue models pick one first and model that out.

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.550
If you have multiple channels where you might be pulling your customers from model one channel at a

14
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.410
time then combining them.

15
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.560
That's why we started with one location and one product for us and for the next step we made one addition

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.940
a second product and then finally we added labor in four more locations that would have been really

17
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.490
hard to do if we started there first.

18
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.770
So one of the benefits of doing this is that it's way easier to catch your mistakes.

19
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.200
I have been building financial models for all sorts of businesses in scenarios for well over a decade

20
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.320
now and I still make mistakes in the building process but I cashed them really easily.

21
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.020
I can fix them just as easily when you do it incrementally building your model one component at a time

22
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.650
and expanding it one feature at a time makes it super easy for you to know when you break something.

23
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260
Starting off with 20 things.

24
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.000
And if it doesnt work where did you make your mistake how would you actually pinpoint that thats going

25
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.770
to be really tough to do that.

26
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.840
So be patient build your model incrementally by starting small and simple your model will be better.

27
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.880
You will experience fewer and less severe headaches in the process and it will definitely be more fun.
