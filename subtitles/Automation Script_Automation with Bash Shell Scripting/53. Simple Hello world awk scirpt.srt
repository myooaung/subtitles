00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,390
Hi friends.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,645
In this video, we are going to see one simple Hello World script using your AW qin.

3
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:12,120
See from our previous videos,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,155
we know what is the syntax for your Edom located, right?

5
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:20,640
So these two are the syntaxes for our edible OK. Now you can feel this is like

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,975
an obligate command and you should have writing your logic on your command line.

7
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:26,850
If you write this logic in one file,

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,100
then you can call that as an applicant script.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,445
Right?

10
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:34,580
And you know some of the blue points for your edible,

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,995
okay? These are the right.

12
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,430
Now here you have to remember that whenever,

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,335
if you want to perform some action on an input, right?

14
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:48,695
If you want to perform some action on your input,

15
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:54,725
then only you how to include your actual action.

16
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,905
And then this is anyway,

17
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:00,935
optional and action, right?

18
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:07,760
So if you want to perform some operation or your required operation on input,

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,690
then only you how to include this middle action

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,995
that is actually actual logic and then end block.

21
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,510
But here in our case,

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,785
we are not going to perform any action on your input.

23
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:27,710
So what is our requirement is simply I want to display hello world using your public key.

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,815
And then you can skip these two blocks,

25
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:33,290
actual logical and block.

26
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,355
Then the only thing you have to use this begin, right?

27
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:42,875
So now I'm going to show you that with the command line mode and as your script, right?

28
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,629
Let me open my terminal.

29
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,775
Phi c.

30
00:01:52,775 --> 00:02:01,355
Let me move into my wondering doublet case scripts.

31
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,550
Like see first thing,

32
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,890
I'm going to display Hello World on your terminal using AW kick command.

33
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,730
Right?

34
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:16,250
Now K, c, I am not going to include

35
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,880
your actual action and end block because I don't want to work on any input.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,115
I want to display simply hello world,

37
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:27,620
then you need only begin block and

38
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:37,410
simply print nuts it.

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,885
See you output.

40
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:42,070
What?

41
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,585
We missed. A parenthesis,

42
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,730
w, sorry, w conditions.

43
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,920
Say that hello world.

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,955
Right? Now the suppose like your AWPA command.

45
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:52,915
Right?

46
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:59,185
Now what I want to do is I want to run this as a AWPA script.

47
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:03,100
Then if you want to write a public case,

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,040
stepped right first to find out what is the location of your AWPA on your host.

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,740
Because you know why lighting shell scripts also you are

50
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,455
mentioning very first-line us shebang line.

51
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:19,995
So bin bash now been a WK You How To mention violating your AWPA scripts.

52
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:22,260
Alright, let me write it.

53
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,040
Hello. Dot AWPA script.

54
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,940
That's it.

55
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,600
Then you are shebang line is been

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,160
AWPA hyphen f. This is the shebang line for your AWPA skits.

57
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,915
Now, whatever you're writing on your command line known by

58
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:47,310
your begin block than inside this, just write, print.

59
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,165
Hello world. That's it.

60
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:57,320
Close it, save it.

61
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,990
Do the execution permission.

62
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,390
Then run like this.

63
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,185
You're getting your output, right.

64
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:11,795
Know, sometimes if you're edible because kept in your hand.

65
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:14,734
And still if you want to run as a WK command,

66
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:17,750
then you can also run in this way, WK hyphen AF.

67
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,805
Then you are HelloWorld.java WK.

68
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,245
And you can see your output.

69
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,720
And guys, while running in this way,

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,595
in this format in your file,

71
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:27,710
you don't need to write your shebang line off

72
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,140
your NW OK. Now let me remove that shebang line.

73
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,040
Now let me run it again because you are mentioning with

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,670
what interpretable you want to run your helloworld dot AWPA,

75
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,030
skip this AWPA right now checked.

76
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,920
But whenever if you want to run as a script,

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,330
write in this format,

78
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,770
and while running in this way,

79
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,310
if you don't have your shebang line inside of your NLTK,

80
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,580
Then shall is not able to identify what is

81
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,525
the skip command which with what interpreted or you want to run that.

82
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:04,840
That's why if you want to run other script,

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,885
very first line you have to mention about IE were shebang line off your AW, OK.

84
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:14,050
Now let me run it. That's it.

85
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,160
Okay.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,940
So here's the, here's a simple script to display.

87
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,710
Simply print Hello world.

88
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,565
I mean, to display Hello World, right?

89
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:28,460
Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
