00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,705
Hi friends.

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:06,600
In this video, we are going to discuss about how

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,960
to add an element or value to an existing array,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,515
or how to remove a value from your existing array.

5
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,870
So these are the concepts we are going to discuss here.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,375
Let me open my terminal first.

7
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,850
So let's just assume that anyway,

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,290
lighting some shell script somewhere,

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,560
you want to define some array and after some time with

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,000
some logic unit to add one more value to your existing array.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,285
Or you may need to remove one value from your, an existing array.

12
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:37,250
Then how you can do these things? Very simple.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,630
Let me take, suppose some ways list as my array I'm taking,

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,970
my list is like orange shell.

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,955
Let's say open two.

16
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:51,155
And let's say some CentOS.

17
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:55,100
Okay, so this is my array.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,610
Now, after some logic, right?

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,205
Offer some lines of code or because of some logic,

20
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:04,070
I came to know that I need to add one more waste

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,015
listed to my existing waste list of array. Very simple.

22
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:10,460
See ways list equals two.

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,775
Fostering your existing enter array elements. That is nothing but this.

24
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:20,165
Already we know how to get all the array elements

25
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:25,560
so that I want to include suppose a i X for this.

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,695
Now see you or echo dollar ways list all elements.

27
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:38,420
Now see so that you can get whether you added new value or not.

28
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,845
Yes, you add it.

29
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,630
Now I want to do one more thing.

30
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,555
Suppose I want to add hedge B, x.

31
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:49,580
Yes, I added. Now just check it.

32
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,895
Yes, it has been updated in your existing array.

33
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:58,370
That is how to add an element or value to you or an existing array.

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,690
Now the thing is I want to remove any one of the value c guys,

35
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,225
in your normal variables whenever,

36
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,295
while working with your normal variables, right?

37
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,750
If x is three,

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,520
how we are removing this x-value?

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,795
Simply unset x.

40
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,675
Now see what is X is that no value?

41
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:17,030
If I write x equals to three and if I display,

42
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,200
you are getting your x value three.

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,160
But now I'm removing that by simply by running unset command.

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,740
And if you see that there is no value.

45
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,770
Now even if you want to remove entire array,

46
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,285
you can do it in this way.

47
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:33,275
But I want to remove only particular value from my list, my, my array.

48
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,195
Suppose I want to remove.

49
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,070
So this is an index Juneau, right?

50
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,110
Index 0, index one, index two.

51
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,530
I want to remove this index of three value that is a x.

52
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,945
Nothing is there simply unset.

53
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:48,110
You are ways the list index.

54
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,820
So index three actually is a value of EA x.

55
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,860
Not try to display your array and see what is there in your array.

56
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,960
Now there is no hex,

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,380
just know we unset that value but based on index.

58
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,640
Right?

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,510
So if I do simply unset in this way,

60
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,250
and if you tried to display your array,

61
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,689
that is no more your array because we just know we remove antibiotic.

62
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,375
We deleted the entire array, right?

63
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:22,590
So this is the way how you can add or remove a value,

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,720
right, for your an existing array.

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,150
Okay guys, thank you for watching this video.
