00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.935
Friends here I'm providing some list of

2
00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:09.105
general purpose command sand helped to use all those commands, S0.

3
00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.495
These are the, some of the general purpose commands.

4
00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:16.095
And apart from this, you are having many more commands in your index word,

5
00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:20.280
but these are the minimum commands you have to know to write f2 shell scripts.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.435
That's fine.

7
00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:23.700
C, along with these commands,

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.655
there are two more commands like what is unmanned.

9
00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.320
By using these two commands,

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.625
you know the description part of your commands and how to use your command.

11
00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.415
You don't have to Google it for your command.

12
00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:38.820
You can also get the information about your command and

13
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.445
the uses of your command from your Linux terminal itself.

14
00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:46.310
Suppose, let me take very simple command called PWD.

15
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.790
You know, generally PWD is nothing but current working better tree.

16
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.925
Suppose if I use what is PWD,

17
00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:56.405
then it will use the symbol description about your command.

18
00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.360
Print name of current working directory,

19
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.670
return working directory name.

20
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.935
Suppose I don't know how to use that,

21
00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:10.280
then simply use man PWD so that it will do the uses of that command.

22
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.250
Not only that, let me take one more command.

23
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.745
Let's say I want to take what is what is itself.

24
00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:24.020
Display manual, page description of your command.

25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.525
Not only that, you can take,

26
00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:31.410
let's say I wanted to do something like Who am I?

27
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.490
See that print f2 user ID.

28
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.900
Suppose that it leaf I run,

29
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.040
Who am I command?

30
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.665
It is giving the logged in user.

31
00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.495
So if you observe here, actually,

32
00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:43.235
I am working with automation user,

33
00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.590
username, which we do by this.

34
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.300
Who am I command?

35
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.455
Suppose if you don't know how to use that simply run man, who am I?

36
00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:57.485
It will do the detailed syntax and usage of your command.

37
00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.465
That's it. Okay?

38
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:01.590
Okay, thank you.
