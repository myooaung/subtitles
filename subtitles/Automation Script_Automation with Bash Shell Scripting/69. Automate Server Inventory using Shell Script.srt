1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
We'll them practice with your shell scripting and friends.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:11,160
In this video, we are going to see one inventory script using your shell script.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,450
That is automate server inventory using shell script.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,155
So how to automate server inventory using shell script?

5
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:23,940
So what is this inventory guys first see inventories,

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,350
nothing but suppose if you want to collect some hardware information of your system,

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,285
some software information of your system,

8
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:34,800
or combination of your software and hardware information of your system, right?

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,380
So he fought this software and hardware information.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,015
You have different types of parameters, right?

11
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:41,470
Just to finding all those parameters, that's it.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,250
Manually, you can run command for each and every parameter and you can find out.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,020
But you should have that.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,985
Right, just right one shell script.

15
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:51,830
Whenever if you want to find all these parameter,

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,965
just run them shell script so that you will get all the values,

17
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:57,605
required values for your case, right?

18
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,690
So that is nothing but simply inventory.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,915
Suppose I am going to take here a simple example as suppose I need server name, right?

20
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:07,580
I need IP address of that server.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,485
And what is the waste type of that server?

22
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,000
And what is the uptime of that?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,590
Not only this, just observe that suppose you install some Java on your host,

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,900
then what is the Java watching you having?

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,215
And what is the location of the Java, right?

26
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:25,370
So I can also add some parameters like Java version, right?

27
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,825
Suppose you've held some web server.

28
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,655
What is the web server type you are having?

29
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,595
And what is the web server version you are having?

30
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:34,160
You may have multiple web servers.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,095
Men for all that you need to collect.

32
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,210
Suppose you have some middleware application,

33
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,030
let's say Tomcat, or some web logic.

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,425
Right?

35
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:49,985
So finding all those values are nothing but simply some inventory.

36
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,390
So this inventory, instead of finding

37
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,845
this all values one by one with the help of commands on your command line.

38
00:01:57,845 --> 00:01:59,105
We would let one shelf skip.

39
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:00,740
And whenever if we required all these values,

40
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,220
what we will do some tubulin shall skip and we'll get the information.

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,340
And after getting your information,

42
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,195
I want to export that data that result into CSV file as well,

43
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:15,230
so that I can share that CSV file with some complaints team.

44
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,460
Right?

45
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,480
So generating your result into result into csv file is very,

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,265
very important in your real time.

47
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:24,590
And guys who just are not,

48
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,930
you are maintaining, suppose some hundreds of servers.

49
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,419
Now I need to find some information,

50
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,880
some parameters of all a 100 servers.

51
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,385
And I want to store all the hundreds ours information into one single CSV file, right?

52
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:39,290
That is nothing but automate

53
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,535
servers inventory using your shell script, multiple servers inventory.

54
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:46,685
So for time being, we are going to work with single server

55
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:49,550
while going forward will work with multiple servers.

56
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,895
Because before going to implement your inventory for multiple servers,

57
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:55,700
you need to know how to connect with your remote server and

58
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,495
executing commands on the remote server from local server, right?

59
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,025
So all those things we have to know,

60
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:06,575
that's why first I'm going to implement your inventory on single server.

61
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:11,105
Then we'll discuss some concepts related with your remote servers from local server.

62
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,985
Then again, we will implement complete.

63
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,735
Discovery or server inventory using your shell script.

64
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:20,660
So for time being, I am going to walk with single server.

65
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,400
And that to what I'm saying is,

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,870
after finding all these values,

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,735
I want to store these values into some CSV file.

68
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:31,145
Let me take suppose if this inventories for multiple servers anyway,

69
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,685
most of the cases you will take inventory for multiples or what's on the right.

70
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:39,155
Then I want to mention some serial number in my CSV.

71
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:42,230
Then I want to write server name.

72
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,400
Right?

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,710
Then I wanted to find IP address of each server.

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,805
Then what is the waste type of server?

75
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:54,260
Is it a unique Simon Linux REX,

76
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,255
right, then what is the uptime?

77
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:59,105
So all these values I want to store into CSV.

78
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,285
And once if I have a CSP than I can share that with,

79
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:06,225
suppose some complaints stream, right?

80
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:10,160
Or whoever it's, the data is require for them I can share.

81
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,970
Right now I am going to implement simple shell script.

82
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,110
Let me implement that.

83
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:22,145
Inventory of officer what?

84
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:29,660
Suppose inventory not s. Let me take simply a ENV and Kiva, right?

85
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,000
They can take any name that's frowned upon.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,070
But me, right? Bin bash.

87
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,590
Right?

88
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,800
So very first thing what you have to find server name, right?

89
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,225
That's why I'm doing simply server name as this value, I mean variable.

90
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:47,510
So that is you have some command to find out your server name.

91
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,025
That is you name hyphen yen,

92
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,930
so that you'll get your server name.

93
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,820
And that is a command, that command output.

94
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,845
I'm going to store it to this variable.

95
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:55,985
Right?

96
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:59,220
Then I need to find out IP address.

97
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,385
So let me run this command if conflict.

98
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:07,595
See if you have done here, this is your IP address right?

99
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:12,514
Now what I am doing is if convict biplane grip with this keyword,

100
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:14,975
I am finding that line.

101
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:17,930
And in this I need first-line.

102
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,115
And in first-line I need suppose a second column.

103
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,960
That's why I'm taking a WK command.

104
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,190
It is very easy to manipulate on rows and columns with your AWPA command.

105
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,960
That's why I'm taking this command on the output of your ifconfig grip, some value.

106
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,530
Right?

107
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,920
Now this command output I want to store into one variable.

108
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,690
That variable is nothing but your IP address.

109
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,029
So here's here, I'm going to implement your inventory with very less parameters,

110
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,935
much in real-time you how lot of parameters you need to find on each and every server.

111
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,770
Right? Then waves type I want to find.

112
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,960
Let me take this as a variable.

113
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,750
You can take any variable, just I'm taking them.

114
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,520
Okay?

115
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,000
So one way is to simply you name. I can dig right?

116
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:32,455
So if you don't you name simply what will get you name is done.

117
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:36,640
I mean, now I want suppose up time.

118
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,635
So this wayfinding your uptime, you had to take cap.

119
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,435
What is that means?

120
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,240
Suppose if you run uptime as I've no,

121
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,670
I'm running my uptime command here.

122
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,440
So you are getting your obtained in terms of minutes.

123
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,070
I'm in one hour, five minutes, right?

124
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,280
So you may have in terms of Howard's,

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
now in terms of minutes,

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,515
human tau in terms of days, right?

127
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:09,860
So based on three criteria,

128
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,605
has unit implemented command for your uptime in case if you have minutes,

129
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:18,425
how to grip your data.

130
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:21,905
So here, one hour for five minutes, right?

131
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:23,930
I can do simply, in my case,

132
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:30,090
I can take simply print first column, second column third.

133
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,820
That's it.

134
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,215
Right?

135
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,585
So whenever six minutes I can take.

136
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,035
But sometimes, you know, you may have some number of days.

137
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,130
If tau in terms of days,

138
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,710
you need to take one more field here.

139
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,600
So fossil find out uptime in that tried to grip weather days, is there or not?

140
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,840
If does, is they just do one more command.

141
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,665
So as of now, suppose I'm

142
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:05,425
implementing this only for hover in case if you have obtained in terms of Howard.

143
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:10,495
So anyway, while implementing full discovery for multiple servers at that time,

144
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,710
I will write completely.

145
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,350
You are command in terms of days,

146
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,630
in terms of minutes, in terms of flowers.

147
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,000
So by default, whatever the code I've written here,

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,125
it will work perfectly.

149
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:28,235
Only engaged if your pen in terms of hours,

150
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:31,985
if you have in terms of only minutes or in if you are in terms of days,

151
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:34,280
then this command will not work for your server.

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,840
Iterate some if-else condition and they're going to write some logic.

153
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,030
So we'll implement that logic while working with

154
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,990
your complete discovery are complete inventory for multiple servers.

155
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,430
That's it.

156
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,040
So now we implemented all these parameters.

157
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,995
Now I want to store all these values into CSV file.

158
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:54,590
So before going to store the result into CSV file,

159
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,270
you should have some header for your CSV.

160
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,230
That's why I'm taking this as my header, right?

161
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:06,450
So for your understanding, just I am writing creating heading CSV.

162
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:17,770
So the energy is nothing but this is my header in my CSV file, right?

163
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,880
So server info, I'm writing dot CSV, that's it.

164
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,010
Now I need to store the result of all these values one-by-one to CSV guys,

165
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,650
because of this line, you are just creating header.

166
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,980
So if you know you, if you observe your CSV file, right?

167
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,555
If you open your CSV file,

168
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:36,730
how it would be, right?

169
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,815
Let me open my yeah.

170
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,210
If you open your CSV file with your excel sheet right there

171
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,625
having rows and columns, right?

172
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,870
So this is first thing,

173
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,610
first row is nothing but a header.

174
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,830
Now from here onwards you light serial number

175
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,290
and then for each server annexed information,

176
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,580
you will write that way.

177
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,200
First, I created this header with this line.

178
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,905
Now I want to stores server one information.

179
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,870
So I'm, that's why I'm taking anyway,

180
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,580
we are going to work with only single server.

181
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,065
That's a deadline taking one.

182
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,780
But whenever you are working with multiple servers in it, right?

183
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,555
And logic such that automatically it has to write the serial number 1234 like that.

184
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:20,395
Right?

185
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,855
Then, anyway, already this is our variable.

186
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,770
Let me store that result.

187
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,960
Then.

188
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,300
You how your IP address.

189
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,945
Then you, how you are ways type.

190
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:35,500
Then you how your uptime.

191
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,855
Then this result next year you'd into take w greater than if it takes angle greater than,

192
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:43,015
your previous information will be deleted.

193
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:45,010
So I am taking here first-time,

194
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,770
I'm creating this file that I am taking greater than buddy or you

195
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,235
need to take to get redirection, right?

196
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,735
That's it.

197
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:57,020
Now let me save this and just run this.

198
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,330
Maybe somewhere we have mistake.

199
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,220
Let me cross check that.

200
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,770
I bear does yeah, we misread that.

201
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:16,240
Symbol. Ipr does equals $2 if config, that's equitable.

202
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,295
Now let me run this.

203
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:19,795
It has been done.

204
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,610
Now if you have the LS siphon Aladdin,

205
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,740
the last two file server info dot csv.

206
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,155
Just now it has been created, right?

207
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:32,905
Just absorb the information in that SI serial number,

208
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:36,745
server name, IP address, right?

209
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:37,870
Os type.

210
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,850
And then your uptime. Now, if you export this into,

211
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,055
Suppose you are windows or anywhere.

212
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:47,170
And if you open that with your XL seat

213
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,605
automatically or data will be rearranged in terms of rows and columns.

214
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:53,965
So that is the advantage by creating your CSV file.

215
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:55,765
So in real-time, right?

216
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,060
Whenever, if you want to get some inventory data,

217
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,625
always we will create in this way.

218
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,955
I mean, the final result you are always going to store into,

219
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:05,680
into your CSV file.

220
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,965
And once you have a CSV, CSV file,

221
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:11,465
then you can send it to mail or you can share with some team.

222
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,585
Or it can also download some to somewhere.

223
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:15,560
Right?

224
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,149
So that's why guys, while working server inventory,

225
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,025
right, make sure that always the final result data you are going to store into CSV file.

226
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:27,455
That is a good practice in your real time.

227
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,120
Right?

228
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,400
And guess well, going forward,

229
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,820
we will go with how to work with multiple servers.

230
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,210
I mean, how to work with remote servers from local server,

231
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:43,340
and how to get complete inventory for all servers at a time from your local server.

232
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,985
We will see that inventory skipped well, going forward.

233
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:50,430
Okay. Yes. Thank you for watching this video.
