00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.335
I Friends.

2
00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:05.595
In this video, we are going to see the next function or operation

3
00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:10.395
of your sed command that is find and replaced with set command.

4
00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.215
So you, just once again, I'm going to,

5
00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:16.485
you are a previous concepts of your sed command.

6
00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.890
You know, the sed command functions or operations or like weaving

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.600
file content based on the line numbers, right?

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.010
So searching, so printed the ends which are having you are required

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.630
word than now financially place, right?

10
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.825
So then that you have some more operations, right?

11
00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:40.460
You already know, let me go and work with your sed command for

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.605
your find and replace your sed command right?

13
00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:54.140
In this way. Now, I want to find something and finding what is there,

14
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.535
that word I wonder replace with some other word in a file using your set command.

15
00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:01.590
Let say example.

16
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.760
I will do one thing. I will take password file.

17
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.914
See how your password file something in this way information.

18
00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:16.030
Now what I want to do is just assume

19
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.130
that root word I want to replace with some other word.

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.830
Right?

21
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.420
So anyway, I don't want to disrupt

22
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.060
the existing file because this is the important of and that's why I just,

23
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:36.050
I'm making a new file called demo password dot TXT file.

24
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.620
Now observe that u, how demo password dot TXT file.

25
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.595
In this file what I want to do is the root word I want to replace with some other word.

26
00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:51.920
A root user I want to replace with some other user, right?

27
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.705
Just simple sed command by using sed command, right?

28
00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:58.865
So you want to substitute, right?

29
00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:00.275
You have to use yes.

30
00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:03.560
Then what is the yuan required or wold word in your file?

31
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.720
Suppose route, and with what,

32
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.505
what do you want to replace?

33
00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:13.230
So I want to replace with suppose some. You'd amine.

34
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.785
That's it.

35
00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.700
Then you can provide your file in this way.

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.750
Now see the output wherever route is there, right?

37
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.565
That there you are getting Udemy,

38
00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:29.390
but this Udemy is not replacing in all the places of your route.

39
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.010
So here I'll show you how rude here also,

40
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.030
you have root right after that a year in Rudy's their anneals, Rudy's that.

41
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.180
But by default it is not going to replace all the places where you how root,

42
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.970
because we use simply this syntax.

43
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.100
So this is going to substitute

44
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.585
the only the first occurred word in each and every line. In each and every line.

45
00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:52.625
If there is a root at very first word,

46
00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:55.415
I mean somewhere whatever the first toward our currents,

47
00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:58.860
that place will be replaced with u demean.

48
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.740
Right?

49
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.840
In case if I want to replace all wherever route is,

50
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.155
they're all words I want to replace in each and every line with Udemy,

51
00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:11.840
then you have to use G globally.

52
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.800
After that.

53
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.470
Now see that wherever the route is there,

54
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.680
there you are replacing Udemy. Right?

55
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.940
Now.

56
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.295
First, let me open you and guys one more thing.

57
00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:27.065
Whatever the operation we are doing now,

58
00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:29.150
that is not going to disturb your original file,

59
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.965
that is not going to replace in your original file.

60
00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:34.120
You can observe your original file.

61
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.260
This is your original file, right?

62
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.940
Just absorb the original file.

63
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.030
Route is that you are not going to replace.

64
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.850
If you want to replace the word Jill file information itself,

65
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.635
what you ought to do, you know,

66
00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:47.935
you have to include it simply iPhone I option.

67
00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:49.195
Right?

68
00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:53.080
Just I'm including hyphen I option and I'm entering, you know,

69
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.445
that hyphen I is very dangerous if you want to take a backup before going to

70
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:03.235
replace with your required information, right?

71
00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:04.420
You just take a backup.

72
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.610
So sed command with iPhone I dot back,

73
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.220
we'll also take a backup and it will modify

74
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.410
the original file content information with your reward required find and replace thing.

75
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.670
Enter.

76
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.655
Now observe you are fine.

77
00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:25.510
So you'd amine is replacing your original file now.

78
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.130
But you'll find means what order file you are using for your set command, right?

79
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.290
Or on which you are using sed command.

80
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.010
Instead of displaying the modified result on your terminal.

81
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.435
If you want to modify in the vagal file itself,

82
00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:42.610
then you have to include Ivan I option.

83
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.370
So only iphone i also you can use it but

84
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.270
before going to modify your original file, right?

85
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.325
If you want to take a backup,

86
00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:54.805
simply you can do hyphenate dot backup back.

87
00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:56.905
That will take a backup, right?

88
00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:58.135
Fine.

89
00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:00.760
And now let me take once again you are original

90
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.240
file C. Now let me go with suppose somewhere daimon is there right?

91
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.670
Now, day money is here also there.

92
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.700
Here I is there in this line to places you how

93
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.600
Damon now what I wanted to ease in a, in any lane.

94
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.945
Anyway, you are sed command is going to work on each and every line right?

95
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:24.835
Now, only the second occurred world I want to replace with something.

96
00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:29.335
That means see that first I'm not going to modify the original file.

97
00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:33.249
That's why I'm not including iphone i option sub shoot,

98
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:39.180
name on with suppose something like system CTL.

99
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.525
Only the second occurred world.

100
00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:45.320
I mean, it's a day my year it is occurring layered first.

101
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.105
So here I don't want to disturb.

102
00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:50.345
If day monies are occurring in the second time in the same line,

103
00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:56.100
then this word I want to replace with the system CTL, right?

104
00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.100
See the output. So here today money is

105
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.235
there as it is only the second occurred word is replacing.

106
00:06:04.235 --> 00:06:07.535
So likewise, you've heard Damon somewhere in one more place, right?

107
00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:10.730
That there also it will do, you will action.

108
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.580
Right? Fine.

109
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.805
Now if you want to modify permanently in our original file itself,

110
00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:19.265
you can do simply iPhone IE.

111
00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:20.705
That's it.

112
00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:22.920
Now see the content.

113
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.530
It has been modified.

114
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.500
Right?

115
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.865
That's fine.

116
00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:40.500
Now, what I want to do is if first let me show you first to file.

117
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.660
Just upload this file. Okay.

118
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.455
Now what I want to do is oh,

119
00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:59.630
let me in your next nobody.

120
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.175
Yeah, fine.

121
00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:05.135
See if any lane consists of nobody,

122
00:07:05.135 --> 00:07:08.945
then that line in that line,

123
00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:12.575
I want to replace no login with some other word.

124
00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:15.260
So there's here what I'm doing is first,

125
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.285
I am searching with some word.

126
00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:18.935
So you know how to such right?

127
00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:25.235
See said simply such guys already we have seen searching video, right?

128
00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:32.795
So what I want to do is whatever the line which consists of some particular word,

129
00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:34.985
that word may be anything.

130
00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:38.630
Right? Let me take simply DevOps, also know bowel.

131
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.615
So DevOps, that line I want to print,

132
00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:43.715
Let me first printer that line.

133
00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:49.590
So you know how to such leads the way how you can submit your file, right?

134
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.100
So DevOps is there, you are able to print.

135
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.755
Now if DevOps is there in their particular line,

136
00:07:57.755 --> 00:08:03.665
then in that line I want to replace bash with suppose some cases rich, right?

137
00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:10.474
So at that time what you had to do E's Find and Replace for such With the DevOps,

138
00:08:10.474 --> 00:08:15.110
then substitute bash with K shell.

139
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.640
Nuts it, see the output.

140
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:24.530
What happened? Yeah, I missed one more slash here.

141
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:30.785
Now see the output where we are,

142
00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:37.890
DevOps, sub shoot bash with K-shell.

143
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.040
Devops.

144
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.530
Yeah, see here.

145
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:59.035
So wherever you have DevOps in that line, right?

146
00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:02.860
Bash is replacing with K-shell because you are applying,

147
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.205
you are finding with the badge and replacing with K-shell.

148
00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:08.500
But before going to perform this action,

149
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.170
your line should our DevOps key word.

150
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.685
If these what is there in that line,

151
00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.820
then only batch will replace with K-shell, right?

152
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.095
So this is a searching Word and in place of this you are replacing with cation.

153
00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:24.550
Okay, so engaged a surgeon dot u House badge multiple times.

154
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.470
And if you want to replace a bash with K-shell global emissions in all places,

155
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.165
then you have to use simply g.

156
00:09:31.165 --> 00:09:35.140
That's it. Okay, so guys,

157
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.905
this is the simple way to find and replace.

158
00:09:38.905 --> 00:09:44.635
So you have to remember your final syntax of set command for your Find and Replace.

159
00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:49.010
Like, let me open my notepad and let me write that.

160
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.075
First thing you know, sed command, right?

161
00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:56.380
Set.

162
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.730
Substitute.

163
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.765
What do you want to substitute your world word with your new word?

164
00:10:01.765 --> 00:10:05.350
Then if you keep G or if you don't keep anything,

165
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.190
first of all, write some file, whatever that file.

166
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.760
So here, the first occurred word.

167
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.130
The first occurred world word will be

168
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.030
replacing

169
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.305
with the new word

170
00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:36.260
on each and every line.

171
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:47.560
That's a substitute Old World

172
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.455
with the New G.

173
00:10:50.455 --> 00:10:57.085
So what is the meaning of G is nothing but replace

174
00:10:57.085 --> 00:11:08.000
all wold words with new word on each and every line.

175
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.705
That's it.

176
00:11:10.705 --> 00:11:14.155
Now I don't want to replace all words, all wold words.

177
00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:19.345
I want to replace only the second occurred old word in each and every line,

178
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:24.070
then nothing is there simply as old, New than two.

179
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.100
Or if you just assume that in a line you house,

180
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.054
suppose some number of times, some particular old-world.

181
00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:33.940
And I want to replace only the second occurred World War two with the new world,

182
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.175
then you have to use this thing. Right?

183
00:11:39.175 --> 00:11:48.770
So replaces second occurred old world with new work.

184
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.450
Then said, here sea rise searching,

185
00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.135
searching from our previous video, right?

186
00:11:56.135 --> 00:11:58.985
What the, what the, what do you want to use to such?

187
00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:00.935
First such with this word.

188
00:12:00.935 --> 00:12:02.630
And then in that line,

189
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.465
if any World War II is then replaced with a new word,

190
00:12:05.465 --> 00:12:10.205
and you can use either G or only one time or second time, right?

191
00:12:10.205 --> 00:12:11.360
I mean second occur world,

192
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.995
whatever it maybe you can use it.

193
00:12:12.995 --> 00:12:22.220
So replaces the Old World with the New World.

194
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:31.640
If that line consists of such word toxic.

195
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.760
So you are searching with this wording on each and every line.

196
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.625
If any line consists of these such word,

197
00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:40.720
then you are replacing some word with other word.

198
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.250
You're going to use like a globally or only 1.

199
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.145
First occurred time was second or third time.

200
00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:47.735
Whatnot, maybe you can use it.

201
00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:51.380
Ok, so this is the simple way to use your find and

202
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.505
replace and find and replace with such option.

203
00:12:55.505 --> 00:13:00.330
Okay? There is very, very important case you need to do some practice on this.

204
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.040
Okay? Okay.

205
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.750
Yes. Thank you for watching this video.
