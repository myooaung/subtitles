00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,230
Hi friends.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,720
In this video, we are going to discuss about

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,890
your air replicate command with action and basic variables.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,645
You guys already, we know what is the syntax of your NLTK command, right?

5
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:22,640
So simply WK options,

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,355
single quotations, clothes and starting,

7
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:30,275
right pattern or close starting and closing curly braces,

8
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,015
then action, then you are fine, limp,

9
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:36,230
or command output also it can provide as input for your end replicate command.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,480
And we how options, right?

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,420
Already we have seen this information in your previous video.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,780
But here we are going to discuss about Arabic K Command with action and basic variables.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,765
Okay, fine, but we'll go with that.

14
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:56,060
First execute LAB GET command with total options, subpattern, and action.

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,970
So you have some command or he has some file.

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,960
And that just tried to execute your edit weaker command without

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,565
providing anything like options, pattern and action.

18
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:09,935
But Columbus or minor triggers.

19
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:12,380
Your quotations and calibers on mandatory.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,895
That is a basic syntax.

21
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:15,575
Let me go and hope m,

22
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,960
suppose you have some file,

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,580
it is seed password, right?

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,915
So this file, and you can do anyway, right?

25
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:28,385
A WK, No options.

26
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:32,795
Now patron, no action. C, the output.

27
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:34,370
You won't get anything.

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,790
You are not going to have any action to perform on your file.

29
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:44,165
So it will do nothing like That's fine. Then.

30
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:46,580
Actually the logic basically.

31
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,810
So whatever you are writing here,

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,475
I shall, That is a logic.

33
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:50,540
So simple.

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,475
Nozick is print something.

35
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:54,305
Suppose C.

36
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:58,745
As of now, I am writing a logic called simply print.

37
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:03,875
Oh kick. Tells you how to use quotations for your string.

38
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,525
I'm printing working.

39
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,685
But how many times it will work?

40
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:10,280
How many times you will print a message. Okay?

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,235
See guys, we know that whatever the action is there,

42
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:19,925
that action will perform on each and every line of your file on your input.

43
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,115
Now how many lines are there in these,

44
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:24,800
how many records are there in this file that many number of

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,650
times you to print, okay. Output.

46
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,685
Right.

47
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,325
Instead of printing some information from your file,

48
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:37,025
simply or printing something based on your requirement.

49
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:41,855
But how many times to display the information that is based on how many lines are there,

50
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:44,540
how many records are there in this fine.

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,600
Now I can also display multiple informations,

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,445
like suppose I want this play,

53
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:50,615
okay, or for that,

54
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:58,680
just to write a comma, then a WK scripting or replicate command as of now.

55
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,160
See the output.

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,855
Right? So this action will perform.

57
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,820
The number of times,

58
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,110
that number of times is based on how many lines are there, I kill it.

59
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,480
This actually is going to perform on each and every length.

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,610
So while performing this action on each and every line or record of your file,

61
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,760
you're not doing anything except a printing information.

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,550
That's why just simply are printing your information.

63
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,335
That's a very simple logic, right?

64
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:34,325
Okay.

65
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:39,035
Now to use your enemy can't command effectively on your files.

66
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:42,800
First of all, you have to know very basic variables.

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,990
Basic variables or dollar,

68
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,940
$1.1 dollar to one, so on,

69
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,760
up to infinity under them can or number of records,

70
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,925
then NF, number of fields,

71
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,650
and then file name.

72
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,630
So on which file Him you are going to work, right?

73
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,305
See, first thing there is not a 0 means the entire file.

74
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:08,720
Suppose if I try to print,

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,540
you know, I don't want to print any message.

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,015
Actually is printed dollars zero.

77
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,740
This is available for variables.

78
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,270
Don't write petitions.

79
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,070
You have to remember this point here.

80
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,560
Don't write quotations for variables.

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,220
So $1 means n-type file.

82
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,065
You're going to display whatever file

83
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:31,595
or having known that entire file it will display at a time.

84
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:34,070
Anyway, it is not much useful.

85
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,360
So, but from this we can say that AWPA,

86
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:46,430
we can also use like a cat command with these edible print dollar genome. Right?

87
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,465
That's fine.

88
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:49,835
Then he helped Danone D21 swan.

89
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:56,360
So this is based on the fields which are there in your file. Right?

90
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,700
And let me take one thing.

91
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,715
I'm going to define my fight because I can't use as of no root EDC password file,

92
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:07,055
let's say some demo dot TXT file.

93
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:08,525
You're already, we have this finite.

94
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:11,015
Otherwise I will delete all this content.

95
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:18,990
I will write something like this is first line,

96
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,845
second line, something.

97
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:26,760
Trace our line.

98
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:34,055
Right? That's fine. Now, if I want to US $1.1 dollar told Dorothy,

99
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,020
first thing you have to understand, thanks.

100
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,135
We're going to work as a without options, right?

101
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:44,755
That means we are going to use separate or as a space.

102
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:47,650
That means if you see your content of your file,

103
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,880
your three records, 1233 lines three records.

104
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,134
And in each record the how, how many feeds?

105
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:59,545
1234. So by default,

106
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:04,910
you are Ricard will split into fields based on space.

107
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,655
Right?

108
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:10,390
So as I said, we are going to work with the only using actual operation.

109
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,060
If you want to include any other separate app,

110
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,390
you have to mention hyphen IAAF option in place of options.

111
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,800
So while going for a rule c,

112
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,789
That means in later videos we will see about options.

113
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:22,399
And patterns.

114
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:29,480
Right now seeing what I'm doing is in oblique rotation, curly brace, frame.

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:37,080
I want to train first two column in each and every line of my file.

116
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,770
C that I want to print first column under

117
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:50,075
the n 30 column. That's it.

118
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,625
I wanted to print first third column.

119
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,790
Then you ought to mention comma a.

120
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,184
Then only you will get space in your output fees.

121
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,450
Right here.

122
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,800
If you don't take common,

123
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,150
Oh, just observe the output.

124
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,330
There is no space.

125
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:14,915
So it's important not to take comma, right?

126
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:18,050
Likewise, which if we only want to

127
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,545
print or which fields you want to print from your given file.

128
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:24,800
You can mention simply you are $1.1 dollar to the Altria up so and so

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,310
on in any number of values you can bring.

130
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,470
Suppose if I try to print the No,

131
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,560
let me take $1.8.

132
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,900
Do we haven't already new ARAF file,

133
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,405
you know that you won't get it.

134
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:42,420
If it is there, then only will get typically is not there, you won't get it.

135
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,480
Right.

136
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,430
So along with your fields,

137
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,595
you can also displays some information also,

138
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:54,320
like I'm writing using a WK command.

139
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,305
So on each and every line at the ending, right,

140
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,510
you'll get this information using a duplicate

141
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,420
Command M. And if you

142
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,915
want to club your variables with your message, yes, you can club it.

143
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:08,795
And anyway, this is not much useful.

144
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:13,710
So this is very useful in your real time by working.

145
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,085
All right, that's fine.

146
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:23,195
So that is using the Eurodollar 1.2x one.

147
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:26,585
Then what is an odd number of records?

148
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:29,810
This is a default variable, guys, right?

149
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,580
Number of free courts,

150
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,905
number of free course, number.

151
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,350
C, if I use that dollar,

152
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,270
sorry, is simply another variable.

153
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,855
Don't take governor for this variable is simply adi, use enough.

154
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,690
This a $1.1 is entirely one variable.

155
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,560
Okay?

156
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,350
So don't come back this with your command line arguments of

157
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,350
your shell scripts or with you or her variables of your shells.

158
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,049
Skip some Olin shells here px is available,

159
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:57,195
and if you want to print the variable value,

160
00:08:57,195 --> 00:09:04,795
you have to use a quote, right?

161
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,490
Sorry, could capitalize site.

162
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,835
Kindled, X means X Valley.

163
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,610
But here Berkeley, the Alawite selfie variable,

164
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,270
enumerate applicant. Don't get confused.

165
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,190
Ok, so let me take it 1 second object.

166
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,565
Then we are going to work with the R naught and R is a variable,

167
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,455
then what is that m naught means.

168
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:34,900
So there is, suppose if i write somewhere here n naught, that is a variable.

169
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,570
So n, or we do the line number.

170
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,600
Suppose, you know, these action will work individually on each and every line.

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,595
So anywhere first you'll work on first-line.

172
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:49,190
Well working on first-line and not value automatically

173
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,280
one while you're working on second Len automatical,

174
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,020
that value becomes to see that 1-2-3.

175
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,315
So based on the line,

176
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:03,770
based on the record line is nothing but in your ED applicant analogy, it is a record.

177
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,800
It will give me the record number. Right?

178
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,835
Now.

179
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:14,089
See, suppose if we want to display only line numbers,

180
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,400
then simply I can use this one, 1-2-3.

181
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,440
Then next one is number of fields and F.

182
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,050
See again this also automatically,

183
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,650
it will count how many fields are there in each and every line.

184
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,755
So to get, to do more clarity,

185
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:36,610
let me modify your demo dot TXT file.

186
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,890
So I'm going to add some random numbers,

187
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,030
give me c at y,

188
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,450
inserts something in second line.

189
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm hurting Only in this way.

190
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,820
In third line C.

191
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,225
Now, in each line you how different the number of fields, right?

192
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,520
So in first, first-line, suppose you have some

193
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:03,700
12345678 in second 1-2-3-4-5 fields, right?

194
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,685
Likewise. Now, see, now I am going to remove NR.

195
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:09,740
Now I'm writing enough.

196
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,225
Now this action is going to perform on each and every line, right?

197
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:16,895
While performing this action on each and every line,

198
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:18,560
automatically on each line,

199
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
how many fields are there that count dual display?

200
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,420
See that?

201
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:30,440
Now I want to display line number as well as the number of fields in each and every line.

202
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,710
By line number, I mean record

203
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,165
an or the number of fields in each and every link in first-line you how eight records or

204
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:42,260
eight fields in second line or second recording how fibrils

205
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,039
in third line or third record the how 11 fields.

206
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,540
So if you want to add some message, no.

207
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,320
Let me write in this way.

208
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:04,520
The line number is write software that a number of fields.

209
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,180
Or let's say it's very clear.

210
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,150
And first-line you how eight fields.

211
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,270
So you should offline, it's better to say the coordinates actually.

212
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,540
So in first recording how eight fields in second record

213
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,719
you how five rails in third recording how 11 feeds.

214
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,260
Right?

215
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,440
So that is the uses of an orange enough.

216
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,490
Now I am going to do one simple assignment.

217
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,430
I just tried to do the solution for this.

218
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,900
See this E limonene first to record how many fields are there.

219
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,985
You have some fields eight.

220
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:51,635
In secondly, how some five reels in 3011 frames.

221
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:52,820
Okay?

222
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,370
Now, if I want to get last to feel in each and every record,

223
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,600
then what is the option?

224
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,825
Right?

225
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:14,660
See, if I print the simply number of trees,

226
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,495
NFV, What do you are going to get?

227
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,910
Only are going to get the field,

228
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,160
number of fields in each and every line.

229
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,665
So if I want to get manually,

230
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,750
after seeing this information,

231
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,160
I have to write a $1.8 to get field, last, free love,

232
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,800
first-line and dollar fight to get the last field of

233
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,905
second record and done 11 to get the last field of third record.

234
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,035
But automatically if you want to get,

235
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,395
simply use enough heat output,

236
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:54,365
you are going to get by default lost from each and every line.

237
00:13:54,365 --> 00:14:02,285
So that is the advantage with enough, right?

238
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,695
Fine.

239
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:07,895
Then lost one is filename C.

240
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:15,660
Let me write a variable called filename here. C dot put first.

241
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,980
Filename will automatically I interface of

242
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,500
file name which you are going to provide for you or command.

243
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,915
So this filename will,

244
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:31,355
this filename will print for the Aneesh and I will link that we are getting three times.

245
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:35,400
Now. I wanted to get filename along with that.

246
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,935
First to feel our second wondered maybe that's it.

247
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:43,025
So filename will do the currently

248
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:45,920
on which file you are working using a replicate command.

249
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,475
That information you will get with LPA filename.

250
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:52,940
Okay, So based likewise you how a lot of variables with

251
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,314
your advocate command and these other very basic variables,

252
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:59,360
we will see some other ones level wearables while

253
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,420
working with the war ended because cutting back.

254
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,110
Right?

255
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,080
Okay. Yes. Thank you for watching this video.
