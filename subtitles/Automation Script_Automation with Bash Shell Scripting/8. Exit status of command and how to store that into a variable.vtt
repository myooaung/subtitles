00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.775
Friends here our concept is exit status of a command C.

2
00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:09.660
Each Linux command returns a status when it is executed.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.765
Status means number, integer number,

4
00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:19.545
and you will get that status as 0 if your command was executed successfully.

5
00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:25.650
And non-zero if your command was executed with another or if your command was failed.

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.545
And you can see what is the exit status of your command by using a question mark.

7
00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.675
Now let me show you that on your command line.

8
00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:36.520
Same thing. We can also use inward shell scripts as well.

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.795
Suppose I am running ls command,

10
00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:40.520
and by observing this output,

11
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.015
we can say that ls command was executed successfully.

12
00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:46.640
And same thing, you can conform from

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.985
this value if I simply display echo dollar question mark.

14
00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:55.505
Now see the result we are getting 00 means before this command.

15
00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:57.875
Actually this command output is 0.

16
00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:02.840
Before this, whatever the command we excluded, that was success.

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.855
What is the before the command ls,

18
00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:07.685
ls was excluded successfully.

19
00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:09.770
Now let me run some invalid thing.

20
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.650
And if I run that you are getting another same thing I can

21
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.620
confirm by running a chordal question mark.

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.599
And now if I get non-zero,

23
00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.845
then I can say that previously executed command was failed.

24
00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:24.470
So if this output is non-zero,

25
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.395
previously exerted commandment, this one, not this one.

26
00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.630
Be clear immediately before this.

27
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.425
What is the command?

28
00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:31.460
This one.

29
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.040
So if this value is non-zero,

30
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.030
previously executed command was failed, that's it.

31
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.015
And you can store this exit status of a command into a variable simply in this way.

32
00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:45.560
First, let me run some command Anyway,

33
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.580
this is invalid command.

34
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.810
You will get an error code.

35
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.585
As I mean, exit status has non-zero.

36
00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:52.640
Now let me capture that India variable.

37
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.980
Simply write x equals $2 question mark,

38
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.570
or let me write variable names,

39
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.655
suitable variable name command,

40
00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:02.060
return code equals two. Well question mark.

41
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.835
Now after running this command,

42
00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:08.420
we are storing the value into the variable.

43
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.660
That means whatever the value you are having in this variable,

44
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.585
that is the exit status of this command,

45
00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:17.825
exit status soft previously executed a command, that's it.

46
00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:22.310
Now let me display value inside of your command,

47
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.990
written core one to seven.

48
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.840
That means, what is the value in this from this from dollar question mark.

49
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.110
So before this doll question mark or before this line, what is the command?

50
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.340
We executed this one.

51
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.080
So this was phase.

52
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.690
It is very, very important.

53
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.280
Fine.

54
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.640
Now, let me give one more example, very useful one.

55
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.550
Suppose I have a file called demo 2.txt.

56
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.770
And in this I am trying to such for let's say name.

57
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.555
Anyway it is there.

58
00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:55.775
And after running that command,

59
00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:59.105
just look for dollar question mark, what is the result?

60
00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:02.615
Now, I'm searching for suppose Narendra,

61
00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:07.415
Now see the echo dollar question mark non-zero.

62
00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:10.895
So after running this command, immediately,

63
00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:15.665
I'm running a chordal question mark means you are getting some general value,

64
00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:18.740
means the previously executed command,

65
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.910
whatever it may be,

66
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.030
that is success, such as means you actually, you are looking for name.

67
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.240
That name is there in these without seeing here,

68
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.400
without seeing in the output.

69
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.950
Immediately after running this command,

70
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.740
if you run a chordal question mark and if it is 0,

71
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.550
then you can say that you are searching thing is there in the file.

72
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.120
And after running this line immediately, I mean,

73
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.505
after running this command immediately,

74
00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:45.800
I'm looking for echo dollar question mark,

75
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.290
then what is the value 11 means before this line?

76
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.495
What are the commands you are executing that was failed.

77
00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:52.865
Failure means actually we are looking for Narendra,

78
00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.905
not in rise, not there in the file.

79
00:03:54.905 --> 00:03:58.535
That is the meaning of exit status of a command.

80
00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:00.500
If your command was success,

81
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.455
then exit status is 0.

82
00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:04.835
If your command was failed,

83
00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:06.860
then exit status is non-zero.

84
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.770
So actually non-zero, it maybe one-to-two fifty-five, any number.

85
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.720
Let me do some of them.

86
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.820
One to seven command not found.

87
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.520
Suppose invalid command, run

88
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.065
the echo dollar question mark and see the result one to seven come and was not there.

89
00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:27.035
One command fail during execution.

90
00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:29.105
Actually our command is valid one,

91
00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:31.145
but while executing we are getting an error.

92
00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:36.110
Let me it is see,

93
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.325
suppose there is a file called this one.

94
00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:41.960
I'm praying to read that.

95
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.735
Actually, you don't have permissions to read that file.

96
00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:47.855
That's the reason you are getting an error and see the result.

97
00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:50.840
You are going to get a URL question mark value as

98
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.755
11 means your command was there, valid command.

99
00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:59.930
But while executing, you are getting an exception and error enemy that was failed.

100
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.515
Under two means, incorrect command Uses.

101
00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:06.635
Suppose ls is a valid command,

102
00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:08.915
even LSI fund LRT is a valid command.

103
00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:12.379
And now if I run ls siphon XYZ,

104
00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:17.540
that is not a valid option for your LS command and see the result what you are getting,

105
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:27.800
22 means you are command uses is invalid or incorrect command usage. That's it.

106
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.230
So we will see different types of

107
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:38.010
command exit status while working with some scripts. Okay, thank you.
