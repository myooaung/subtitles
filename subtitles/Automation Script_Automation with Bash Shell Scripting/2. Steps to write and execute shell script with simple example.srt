00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,945
Hi friends.

2
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:04,785
Here our concept is how to write and execute the shell script.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:08,475
Let me explain this concept with the help of a simple shell script.

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:12,900
That is simple shell script to get HTTPD version and port number.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,185
Friends here I'm providing some steps to write your shell script.

6
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:18,660
And these steps are applicable for beginner.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,555
So if you're already having some exposure with your shell script,

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,490
then directly go and write your shell script.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,795
But if you are the beginner,

10
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:26,875
please do follow the steps.

11
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:31,250
The very first one is get all manual commands for your requirement.

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,950
So here our requirement is we need to find

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,830
HTTPD Washington port number using PowerShell script.

14
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,230
Then you have to get the commands for them.

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,030
Let me get the commands.

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,140
See if you run simply HTTPD hyphen v,

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,510
you are getting your hedge,

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,605
everybody washing information in the output.

19
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:51,155
But I need to get exactly to dot-dot-dot for one,

20
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:52,640
then modify the command.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,175
Don't worry how I'm modifying this command.

22
00:00:55,175 --> 00:01:00,020
We'll discuss that in detail in our falling sessions as of now,

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,475
just to concentrate on how to write and run a shell script.

24
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:08,490
Then in the first line,

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,920
I want to get second field.

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,275
But here we are getting some parenthesis.

27
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,595
Let me remove them.

28
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:19,730
Once again, just apply your obligate command or

29
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,620
command and print first

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,455
affiliates so that you are going to get you are required what Shen,

31
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:28,430
then we need to find HTTPD port number as well.

32
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,480
So there is a default configuration file for HTTPD.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,050
Then from that, we are trying to get the port number.

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,280
So here we are getting output, I listen 80,

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,995
but I wanted to get exactly port number only.

36
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:45,410
I don't want to get lizard then apply here also edit like

37
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,470
a command just to print the second field.

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,710
That's it.

39
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,040
Now first, copy these two commands.

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,010
So I'm copying and pasting somewhere.

41
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,460
There's the first command and second command.

42
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,349
So by this, we got our commands for our requirement.

43
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:10,040
Then, now start writing web shell script.

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,215
So while writing or shell script,

45
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:16,940
first thing is you have to open a text file with extension has dot SH.

46
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,554
And here, dot SH is not mandatory.

47
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:24,530
We are providing that extension just to know that that is a shell script.

48
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,955
Now let me write some,

49
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:29,405
let me open some text file with extension as dot SH.

50
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:35,840
So I'm writing a shell script name as HTTPD Wusheng under then port dot SH,

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,315
just now opened our text file.

52
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:41,210
Then second thing, you have to write,

53
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,910
the very first-line has shebang or interpreter.

54
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,795
Nothing but what is the shell you are using to

55
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:52,670
execute your shells could see generally in interviews,

56
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,495
if they ask a question like, what is a shebang,

57
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:59,360
then most of the people will say that

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,050
shebang is nothing but been bash, don't say like that.

59
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:09,230
Shebang is nothing but by using which shell you want to run your shell script C,

60
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,540
We how different types of shells in our

61
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,360
It's like a systems, right?

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,980
C. Let me show you them once again.

63
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,465
Suppose on my operating system,

64
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,070
I hold these many shells.

65
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,140
Then what is the shell you want to use?

66
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,115
Suppose I want to use Bash to execute my shell script.

67
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:31,010
Then you have to provide the path

68
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,320
for that required shell as a very first line in your shell script.

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,360
Suppose I want to use Bash,

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,915
but I don't know what is the complete path of my Bash.

71
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:49,190
Then simply run which bash it will do the location or complete path of what Bash shell.

72
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,095
Then simply copy that.

73
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:56,755
Then open your shell script and start with hash tree.

74
00:03:56,755 --> 00:04:02,800
Then paste your complete path for your shell.

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,415
That's it.

76
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,320
So that is the shebang line.

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,910
So don't say that Xi Wang Lin,

78
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,650
nothing but been bash in

79
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,325
your Bash shell scripting shebang line is nothing but been bashed line.

80
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:16,150
But generally newer inner shell scripting shebang is nothing

81
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,590
but a shell which is used to run newer shell script.

82
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,375
That's it. Fine.

83
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,800
Then after that, just to paste all your manual commands in sequence.

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
Now we have our commands.

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,795
Just copy these two commands and go to your file.

86
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:33,805
You are textFile.

87
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:39,365
Then just to place here commands in sequence, that's it.

88
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:42,095
Then save it. Then.

89
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:44,405
Now we have written our shell script.

90
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:48,920
There is the shell script. Then how to run your shell script?

91
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,675
That is step three.

92
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:53,945
So a running or executing shell script.

93
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,795
So before going to run or execute your shell script,

94
00:04:56,795 --> 00:05:00,215
you have to provide execution permission for your shell script.

95
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:08,105
C, If I check permissions for my file.

96
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:11,915
So it is not having any execution permission for the user.

97
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:15,050
Then I can run simply by using, I mean,

98
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,690
I can provide execution permissions by using

99
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,740
change mode with the letters or with the numbers.

100
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,985
Suppose I want to provide seven, sorry 75.

101
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,260
Then.

102
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:37,265
Now see that our eye can remove execution permission with some letter also.

103
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:39,395
Or if I want to provide,

104
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:43,290
then I can use change more plus x.

105
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,240
Nausea, that isn't you.

106
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,655
How your execution permission for your fine.

107
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:53,825
So once you've held execution permission, then simply run,

108
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:58,325
you were sheltered by a syntax

109
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:03,274
like dot slash shell script mean.me in the current location,

110
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:05,540
we how our self-esteem,

111
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,280
that's a and if this is a very simple shell script.

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,130
So that is one way to run your shell script.

113
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,635
Suppose if you are in the different location,

114
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:20,120
just assumed that as of nano shell script isn't there in this location.

115
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,270
But assume that you are in a different location.

116
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,880
So here we don't know how our shell script,

117
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,230
so that shell script name is.

118
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,565
But if I run that, it will say that there is no such file or directory.

119
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,490
So if you are in the different location and

120
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,535
your shell script is there in another location.

121
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,185
If you want to run your shelf scale,

122
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,425
then you ought to provide complete path for your shell script.

123
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:52,640
That's it. Now see there is a right.

124
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,070
So friends, these are the steps to write and execute your shell script.

125
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,950
There is one more way just to execute your shell script.

126
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,174
Whenever, if your shells countries not having an execution permissions,

127
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,080
that is simply see that.

128
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,305
So as of now we don't have any execution permissions for our shell script.

129
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:20,240
But still you can run simply by SH or by providing your shell script name.

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,915
That's it. Right? Not only as such,

131
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:28,550
you can also use Bash, sorry, b,

132
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,920
SH, because I'm executing

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,210
with this shell or I'm executing with the shell, that's it. Right?

134
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,265
But please follow these steps

135
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:42,905
just by writing your shell script, provide execution permission,

136
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:47,075
then run in this way if you are in the current location where your shell script is there,

137
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:48,755
or if you are in a different location,

138
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:52,085
then just to provide a complete path to execute your shelf.

139
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,870
That's it. Thank you.
