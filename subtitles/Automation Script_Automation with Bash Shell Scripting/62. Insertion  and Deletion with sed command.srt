00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,920
Hi friends.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,390
In this video, we are going to discuss the next operation or function of

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,655
your set command that is simply insertion and deletion with sed command.

4
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:18,415
That means just agenda.

5
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:20,350
You have one file in that file,

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,790
if you want to add or insert a new line,

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,505
or if you want to lead some existing line,

8
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:30,505
how you can perform with your set command.

9
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:31,570
Right?

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,915
So there is from our previous video site already we have seen

11
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:39,685
this concepts like viewing file content with your sed commands such fine and replace.

12
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:43,845
Now we are going to work with insertion or deletion with your set command.

13
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:46,700
And next we will see the important thing that is

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,790
sed command with some regular expressions, right?

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,085
That is actually very useful case in your real time.

16
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,430
But before entering into sed command with the regular expressions,

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,520
you should be good with these all operations.

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,095
So already we have seen first three.

19
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:04,235
Now we are going to work with insertion or deletion, right?

20
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:05,345
Fine.

21
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:11,405
See, from our previous videos already we know the syntax of your sed command, right?

22
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,050
Set some options, then commands,

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,320
then the file which you want to work with your sed command.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,575
So here, whenever, if you want to work like insertion or deletion with your set command,

25
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:28,550
you need to remember these flags under your commands.

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,710
They are like I hear a and b.

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,400
So i and j modes are used to

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,255
insert a new line in the existing file with your set command.

29
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:45,590
And D is used to delete some line from your existing file.

30
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:53,970
But here i is nothing but inserting a new line before Butler line number.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:01,680
Yea, it insert some new line right after put level line number.

32
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,225
Right? So further you are going to use IND,

33
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,285
so before line, after line,

34
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:12,140
then d. So you have to remember these three flags if you want to

35
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,280
work with the word insertion and deletion with your set command.

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,595
So insert your sergeant that you have your file right?

37
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:22,145
So agenda the awesome lines.

38
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:23,960
So insertion means whether you want to

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,630
insert just a generous about this is line number two.

40
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,425
Now you want to insert a before this line or after this line,

41
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:34,055
or maybe any line number before this line or after that line.

42
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:36,785
So before if you want to insert you how to use IE,

43
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:39,380
after if you under insert you how to use Yay.

44
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,420
And anyway, delete and there is only one option D, right?

45
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,560
Fine.

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,025
And now let me go with one by one, right?

47
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:51,470
So inserting new line.

48
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,410
So I want to insert some new line or

49
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,790
some new information in your file with your sed command,

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,075
then C, That said line number,

51
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:04,115
whatever the line number you need.

52
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:07,385
Then option I, then filename.

53
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:10,265
So guys, this IE is different from options I.

54
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:13,385
So in options if you use IE, right, hyphen IE,

55
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:17,825
that because of that you are going to modify the original file content.

56
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:18,800
Right?

57
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,840
Let me show you on your command line.

58
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,150
Suppose first let me take some symbol data called employee Info.plist file.

59
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,230
Okay?

60
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,585
Now guys, suppose this is one,

61
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:36,020
some file which consists of some embolize information.

62
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,165
Now in this file,

63
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,190
I want to add some header.

64
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,710
I want to add some header.

65
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,640
So header is nothing but unit to insert before this length,

66
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,310
right before first linear to insert that,

67
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,990
then that will become a header.

68
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,140
So what I can do is set, right?

69
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,100
So before first-line, So one is nothing but line number.

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,630
So before that line number,

71
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,025
I want to insert a header.

72
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,405
That way you have to use I,

73
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:04,725
I means before that line number.

74
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:07,630
So what do you want to insert that you have to write here?

75
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,045
Suppose I want to insert like serial number,

76
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:15,475
then name, then suppose salary.

77
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:19,975
Then in your file for c, the output, right,

78
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:24,940
you're able to insert the word line before a particular line number that is called one.

79
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,805
And because of the sed command,

80
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:30,550
you are able to write your information only while

81
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,330
displaying if you want to modify your original file content.

82
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,115
See as of now, if you see your file,

83
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:40,240
what Jill file is not affecting only while displaying the output on your terminal.

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,625
You are able to add your header.

85
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:46,194
But this information I want to add permanently

86
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:50,630
in my existing file called employee in 2.txt.

87
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,830
Then what I have to do simply use hyphen option.

88
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,395
So said hyphen, I.

89
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,450
Now see the file content.

90
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,985
Yes, you inserted a line called this one before first line number.

91
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:08,360
Now, suppose after this line,

92
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,420
first-line, Now this is first-line right off that, this first line.

93
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,420
Suppose I want to insert some something like anything.

94
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,125
Let me take some said hyphen I

95
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:27,240
off the lane number 11 year and just I mean, inserting these hyphens.

96
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:35,375
Right now. See that after this,

97
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,660
you are inserting this hyphens.

98
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,780
So offer first-line of their first-line.

99
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,875
This is line number one.

100
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:48,155
After that, you are inserting this data the same way as if nobody the last length.

101
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:49,505
So but this is the last line.

102
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:50,690
So in your set command,

103
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,275
you can identify by default the last line with the help of dollar.

104
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:55,190
Right?

105
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,515
Now, off the last line,

106
00:05:57,515 --> 00:06:00,365
I want to insert again these hyphens.

107
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:07,340
Then what you can do simply see that instead of one and the existing line,

108
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,900
last line is this one.

109
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,580
Right? Now see the content.

110
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,545
That's it. Alright.

111
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:24,770
So using i and j inserted before inset of the particular line number.

112
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,420
Now not only like that,

113
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,965
you can also insert a new line before a particular word.

114
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:35,210
I mean, suppose I want to insert a new line before this Narendra up.

115
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,790
What I want to insert a new line,

116
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,940
suppose after this clinton, Right?

117
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,555
So then I can do in this way said hyphen I0.

118
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:47,300
So you know how to such a line right out

119
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,300
to search the lines which are having Butler word.

120
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,975
So we have seen that while searching with your set command.

121
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:59,510
Suppose I want to insert after this,

122
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,860
after Narendra, or let me take before that before Narendra,

123
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,575
wherever you how Narendra before that line.

124
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:10,100
I want to insert a new line. Let me do that.

125
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:19,150
So I'm taking something like That's it.

126
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,680
Right.

127
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,975
Now. See the file content.

128
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:28,910
Just know you inserted before Narendra some name called monica.

129
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,105
Right?

130
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:34,824
Now, same way. Suppose I want to insert offer Clinton.

131
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:36,790
I want to insert some new data.

132
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,470
Then said hyphen, I suppose after Clinton.

133
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,965
So wherever you helped Clinton line after that line.

134
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,060
Right?

135
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,800
I want to insert,

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,050
after, I want to insert,

137
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:59,940
let's say suppose some, some data.

138
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,430
I mislead one quotation.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,085
Now see the content. What do help?

140
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:16,670
Yes, you insert a new data after Butler,

141
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,210
a lane which consist of Clinton, right?

142
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,555
So this is the way how you can insert based on

143
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:28,355
line number before that line number or offer that line number by using I and II,

144
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:33,905
or based on the lines which are having some particular word, right?

145
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,560
And that too before that word or offer that word,

146
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,920
before that word, and here after that word.

147
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,790
Right?

148
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,895
Now the last one is how to delete a line.

149
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:44,915
Right?

150
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:47,345
See that suppose you have this information.

151
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,775
Now, I want to delete a particular line number.

152
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,575
Let's say this is first-line, right?

153
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:54,540
Second line, third line, I want to delete.

154
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,310
So simply said.

155
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,850
So fundamentally I want to do it.

156
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,930
That's why I'm including iPhone.

157
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,435
I, I want to delete third line.

158
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:06,335
That's it.

159
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:09,725
Now see the file content. You have been deleted.

160
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:13,265
Third line, right? Not only that,

161
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:16,550
I want to delete a lane which consists of suppose some anneal.

162
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,070
Then first such with Annie.

163
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,970
That line, you just delete it.

164
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,810
Now, see that? Right?

165
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:34,430
So there is a simple way to insert a line before Butler thing or offer Butler thing.

166
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,310
And then a delete a link based on

167
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,605
your required line number or based on the lines which are having you are required word.

168
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:44,015
Right.

169
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:48,270
Okay, guys. Thank you for watching this video.
