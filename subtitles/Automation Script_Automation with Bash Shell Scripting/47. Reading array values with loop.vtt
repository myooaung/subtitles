About how to read array values with the loop.

2
00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:10.590
See directly if you want to print your array values,

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.230
you can print at a time by using echo,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.795
dollar reward or a variable name and then at the rate r star in square brackets, right?

5
00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.600
But if you want to read with loop how you can vote on

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.120
which loop to use to read your values.

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.650
All right, let me open my terminal first.

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.645
See, suppose if I have somebody,

9
00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:33.755
let me take simple array something arrays there.

10
00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:37.100
So I can directly display all the values of your array

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.875
using this or I may under it or using star, it will work.

12
00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.010
And I can also read values based on index values, right?

13
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.690
Like one.

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.885
Then what is the value at index 0?

15
00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:55.970
But I want to read one by one value automatically with the help of loop.

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.740
Then how can I do that?

17
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.255
It's very simple.

18
00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:07.579
Let me write arrays with loops.

19
00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.180
Let me take my for loop here

20
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.395
because it's very easy to read your values one-by-one with help of for loop.

21
00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:20.090
So before going to apply your Lu for arrays, suppose if you have a,

22
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.100
something like a for loop is syntaxes for each in.

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.265
Now you can ID here something like hi, hello.

24
00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:35.510
Okay. Now just to do and echo your dollar each value and see the output,

25
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.690
what you are getting, right?

26
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.760
Yes, you are able to get your one-by-one value,

27
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.725
which are mentioning in your loop, right?

28
00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.560
We mentioned here value that values you are getting one by one.

29
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.990
Now we know R is nothing but placing

30
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.140
some values in one variable with the space is same as this one.

31
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.920
Note. Now you can assume this is one audio-only.

32
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.210
So that's why I simply,

33
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.475
I'm taking suppose here.

34
00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:08.720
As, let's say my array equals to three fourths.

35
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.090
Try even some string also,

36
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.430
no problem. Alright, some values.

37
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.270
And that's it.

38
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.350
Now what I'm doing is writing your values here and what I'm doing now I'm going to

39
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.015
place your variable name that to all values I want to consider.

40
00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:24.660
That's it.

41
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.490
Now you are reading your RA RA values with the help of loop. Yes, you are getting.

42
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.780
So this is the way how you can read our values are the values with

43
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.880
the help of loop. Right?

44
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.575
Okay.

45
00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:45.470
Okay guys, so this is very simple concept.

46
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.520
I want to give you.

47
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.050
Thank you for watching this video.
